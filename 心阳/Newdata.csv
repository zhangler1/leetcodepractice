This proposal provides a multidisciplinary approach to the integration of three education programs with the aim of building innovation activities in small- and medium-sized U.S. manufacturing firms (SMMs). These three programs are 1) the Manufacturers Innovation Leadership Program (MILP), designed for manufacturers who have leadership potential within SMMs; 2) the Presidential Innovation and Creativity Scholars (PICS), which will create multidisciplinary teams of senior college students and faculty, who will produce and process innovation projects with small manufacturers participating in MILP; and 3) the Innovation Program for Teachers (IPT) which provides K-12 teachers an opportunity to take an internet-delivered class on manufacturing innovation. MILP will embrace a combination of experiential, problem-based, and research-based learning. Project participants will study innovation successes, learn about innovation processes, perform research to evaluate alternative solutions to problems, and be mentored by, and interact with, leaders in innovation from SMMs as well as by university faculty.

The future global competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing depends on the innovation capacity of SMMs.  Societal and economic impacts include job creation and retention, wealth creation, student education, minority manufacturing capabilities, and K-12 education for innovation. By targeting manufacturing capability in the state, the project will have a direct impact on the diverse, lower income populations of Oklahoma.  Moreover, an explicit effort is made to include underrepresented groups, including military veterans, in the state of Oklahoma in all facets of this project.

Partners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: Oklahoma State University (OSU) (lead institution) and Cameron University;  Private Sector Organizations: Charles Machine Works, Lucas Metal Works, Oklahoma Manufacturing Alliance, and Stolhand Heating and Air Conditioning; and State and Local Governments: Oklahoma EPSCoR and Oklahoma Center for Advancement of  Science and Technology (Oklahoma City).","Evert, A., Blackwell, C., Tilley, D., Weckler, P. & Holcomb, R.~Students' Perceptions of communications and course motivation provided by faculty~Natural Sciences Education~42~2013~1-10~~~0~ ~0~ ~21/07/2020 04:06:12.803000000, Pruitt, J.

This project will accelerate the movement of bioscience discoveries to commercialization for a leading agricultural biotechnology state and region, Kansas. In particular, there is merit in designing ways to produce more value from current bio-based waste streams, including those from ethanol production processing streams.  This project represents a new approach to linking world class agriculture and bioscience investments in the state to new innovation methods, particularly scale-up methods for bio-processing.

The project will enhance general economic well being in Kansas.  It will increase the transfer of technologies to Kansas companies; stimulate the formation and assist the development of technology-based businesses in Kansas; increase new products brought to market; and provide access to a coordinated Early-Stage Technology Development (ESTD) resource that significantly accelerates the development and hardening of new bioscience-based products, processes, and technologies in Kansas. The major societal impact will be the creation of wealth and high-paying jobs for the citizens of Kansas.  In addition, creating a model process that benefits both the technology creator/inventor and the recipient will stimulate transformation of intellectual property created in both company and university laboratories into commercial products.

In line with the objectives of the PFI program, a related goal was to establish a collaborative research partnership between Kansas State University (a national university and PFI graduated grantee/lead institution) and Pittsburg State University (a regional university and New Participant Institution).  

To accomplish this objective, the project team worked to identify a group of university experts from the two collaborating institutions to help bridge the ""Valley of Death"" for early-stage bioprocessing products and technologies in Kansas.  Ultimately, personnel from four university organizations worked together to conduct early-stage bioprocessing product and technology development projects. The team included Kansas State University personnel from the Advanced Manufacturing Institute, the Bioprocessing Industrial Value Added Program, and a newly established Kansas State University campus:  K-State Olathe.  Personnel from the Kansas Polymer Research Center (KPRC) led this Partnership For Innovation project at Pittsburg State University.  Altogether, 20 faculty and unclassified professionals &ndash; twelve from Kansas State University and eight from Pittsburg State University were engaged in this project.  In addition, three graduate students, seven undergraduate students, and two postdoctoral researchers got involved in the project.  

To build this partnership the project investigators focused their efforts on finding and completing industrial innovation projects that required expertise from multiple people, especially those that required expertise from more than one partnering organizations.  Each project forged collaborative engineering and science relationships that will extend beyond the scope of this grant. Project activities included:  feasibility analysis, technology research and development, design and engineering, and pilot plant process and product development.  

The partners completed collaborative research and engineering projects with 17 private companies, three other university organizations, and three non-governmental organizations. Two different state agencies were also engaged in this effort.  Projects could be categorized in the following four areas:  animal health technology and products, biobased materials and products, byproduct recovery, and new business and research partnerships.  Products from the grant included:  nine journal papers, six conference papers/presentations, three book chapters and four other/one-time presentations or publications.

A significant example of the project work completed as part of this grant was the work that was done through multiple projects on a Phosphorous Reduction System (PHRED) for waste streams.  PHRED was invented and patented during work on K-State's first PFI grant (EEC 0438691) with specific application to removing phosphorous from waste lagoons at concentrated animal feeding operations.  During this current PFI grant, the team developed a better understanding of how the system was working in real waste streams and modeled the system dynamically.  Consequently, PHRED was significantly enhanced and improved technically and has also been applied to reduce phosphorous in other waste streams such as those generated from ethanol production.  Furthermore, the team was able to secure further funding to support PHRED research and development from other sources including the USDA SBIR program.

The industrial partners were Siemens Corp., Technical Vision Inc., and Vibrational Specialty Corp. It also included the economic development partner, the Ben Franklin Technology Partners (BFTP) of Southeastern Pennsylvania.

The extensive expertise housed at the Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University in the area of urban radar and through-the-wall radar imaging has been utilized to solve outstanding problems in acoustics and ultrasound imaging such as flaw detection, localization and classification under complex scattering, reverberations, and multipath scenarios. In particular, multipath modeling and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) imaging principles, prominently used for radar imaging of targets in indoor environments, have been successfully applied and employed for ultrasound testing of materials with known geometry.

The NSF PFI project has improved the efficiency of structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques via advanced modeling and processing of Lamb waves that are used to inspect critical plate structures such as airplane panels, wind-turbines, and helicopter blades. We have shown that the interaction of Lamb waves with defects in plates is quite complex, as it depends on the angle of incidence, the incident mode, plate properties, and operating frequencies.  We have successfully modeled such complex interaction and supported our theoretical model development by experimental verification. We implemented separate modeling of the independent symmetric and anti-symmetric modes to provide additional capability for enhanced detection and classification of defects. Such models prove critical in designing acoustic sensing systems for SHM.

We cast the defect imaging problem in Lamb wave SHM in a sparse reconstruction framework by recognizing that the number of defects is typically small. The emerging compressive sensing techniques are used to achieve high-resolution defect images. New methods are developed to effectively utilize the group sparsity provided by the MIMO structure, different propagation modes, and the spatial extent of defects.  Sparse Bayesian learning techniques have been employed to provide robustness for high-resolution signal reconstruction. These techniques are considered attractive in the underlying application due to their effective exploitation of signal structure and prior information relative to flaw contiguity and flow position likelihood.

We have applied signal processing techniques to improve discrimination against abnormalities of condition monitoring systems via advanced statistical modeling and analysis of vibration signals from industrial running machines. Faulty rolling element bearings have been detected using techniques based on high-resolution subspace methods, maximum likelihood estimation, harmonic analysis, time-varying filtering, and time-frequency analysis.

The NSF PFI grant was instrumental in the establishment of the Acoustics and Ultrasound Lab (AUL) which has become the center of acoustic and ultrasound research and education in the College of Engineering, Villanova University.  The AUL conducts experimentations aiding in proof of concept in ultrasound imaging, acoustic sensing and structural health monitoring.  The lab promotes collaborations between Mechanical and Electrical Engineering disciplines in the area of non-destructive evaluation and provides the necessary equipment for training undergraduate and graduate students in the broad area of acoustic and ultrasound signal processing.

The field of Mobile Health, or M-Health, is the merging of mobile technology and healthcare. Its purpose is to extend the reach of healthcare services to people living in rural, remote, or isolated areas who do not have routine access to healthcare. M-Health allows for effective medical analyses and decisions to be made where remote patients are located, rather than requiring them to travel to a distant city to receive medical care. Ocular trauma, glaucoma, and macular degeneration are all significant causes of preventable vision loss, if detected and treated early. A series of devices is proposed which act as medical examination extensions to a smartphone. A visiting healthcare practitioner attaches such a device to a smartphone and runs a custom app to perform a specialized examination of specific portions of the eye. Using a WiFi or cell signal, the smartphone app submits the collected examination data to a remote ""expert system,"" which provides in-depth medical analysis processing. The analysis results are sent back almost immediately and are displayed onscreen to the healthcare practitioner. Through this process of telediagnosis, the project offers the potential of greatly improving remote patient screening and triage. It will help to ensure that patients with undiagnosed eye diseases are detected early and can arrange to visit an ophthalmologist in time to prevent permanent eye damage. The result of establishing this paradigm of remote medical care will extend healthcare to those most in need.

The project establishes a smart service platform in ophthalmology by creating a server-based telediagnostic analysis capability for current and future smartphone-based ophthalmic examination devices, three of which are to be developed in this effort: a microscopic extension, a panoptic ophthalmoscope, and a portable slit lamp. This capability would allow examination data, gathered with such devices, to be sent wirelessly to a remote server for automated analysis, the results of which would be sent back to the originating smartphone. This server-based telediagnostic analysis capability allows for either tele-expert or automated machine-based in-depth evaluation and diagnosis of the submitted image data. This is made possible because smartphones are ubiquitous and Internet-connected. This capability enables both real-time and store-and-forward teleconsultation and communication to other health professionals for a full diagnosis later in time when convenient or possible. These handheld devices will enable field-conducted examinations that are otherwise restricted to clinical settings (e.g., medical offices and clinics). Compared to state-of-the-art ophthalmic equipment, the proposed devices will be miniaturized, portable, and usable even by non-specialists outside clinical settings.

At the inception of the project, the partners are the lead institution, University of Arizona (Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Electrical & Computer Engineering and Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science), and a small business, Breault, Inc.

Without extra interventions, these numbers are predicted to rise to 75 million blind people by 2020 (WHO 2010). 67 million people worldwide have glaucoma, which is expected to rise to 80 million by 2020 and age-related macular degeneration will affect ~196 million worldwide in 2020 increasing to ~220 million in 2040 (iapb.org). Vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy will rise to ~247 million people losing their vision by 2030. In North America alone, the direct cost for vision loss due to all causes is approximately $500 billion (BrightFocus Foundation).

Visually impaired patients all around the world lack access to localized, accessible, affordable ophthalmic healthcare necessary to tackle these issues. Ophthalmology, which is the medical science of the eye, requires a systematic knowledge of the anatomy, physiology, and diseases of the eye collected through observation, experimentation, and measurement typically obtained by a variety of expensive, large optical metrology instruments, such as ophthalmic microscopes, slit lamps, funduscopes, etc. In densely or sparely populated communities spread over vast distances, ophthalmic healthcare can be inaccessible due to metrology instrument or facilities unavailability and prohibitive cost. Additionally, there is in general a lack of qualified personnel in many sectors of ophthalmic healthcare while hazardous environments (e.g., military settings) themselves are not conducive to in-resident medical professionals.

The Outcome: SmartOphthalmicsTM, a smartphone-based ophthalmic service platform, developed under this NSF PFI:BIC award, comprises smartphone examination instruments, easy to use apps, and expert wireless remote cloud-based telemedicinal examination support for diagnosis and treatment by the on-site practitioner. As such, it paves the way towards smart tele-ophthalmology. This paradigm may greatly improve remote patient screening and triage by ensuring that patients with undiagnosed eye diseases are detected early and treated in time to prevent permanent vision impairment, and especially blindness. Establishing this paradigm has the potential to change the very economy of extending quality healthcare to many while reducing cost for patients, insurance carriers, and economies at large.

The SmartOphthalmicsTM paradigm will augment the traditional health clinic-centric ophthalmic examination archetypes. It will add a fully automated pre-diagnostic capability in lieu of the absence of qualified medical personnel, thereby concatenating mobile health and telemedicine to provide both rapidity of evaluation and increased coverage. As a result, significant causes of preventable vision loss, such as ocular trauma, glaucoma, and macular degeneration, may be detected early and treated in time to prevent permanent vision impairment, and especially blindness.

To support a SmartOphthalmicsTM platform of metrology instruments, the research, development, and design aspects of this NSF PFI:BIC effort have purposely centered around creating fundamentally enabling optical and software architectures that serve as an extensible platform for a variety of smartphone-based ophthalmic devices (see above) to come, the first of which is a smartphone-based binocular pupillometer prototype as the flagship device of this NSF PFI:BIC effort. This development constitutes a significant breakthrough: An end-to-end integrated system was tested comprised of a smartphone-based ophthalmic examination device (i.e., binocular pupillometer), the bi-directional encrypted data transfer between the smartphone and a smart server-backend (addressing HIPPA considerations), the server-side analysis of the video data and extraction of key parameters, and the onscreen display of the extracted analysis data back on the smartphone.

The completion of this 4-year NSF PFI:BIC effort has laid the foundation for subsequent commercialization of the SmartOphthalmicsTM technology through a newly formed startup company in the ophthalmic sector as the culmination of this NSF award.

As a logical continuation and significant expansion of this NSF PFI:BIC effort, the Center for Informatics and Telehealth in Medicine (InTelMed; Website: http://intelmed.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona was founded in 2018 with the help of a NSF I/UCRC planning grant (NSF CNS-1624488). The InTelMed Center is committed to research &amp; development in human-centered smart service platforms, such as intelligent biofeedback-controlled monitoring and intervening wearable sensor technologies. In particular it will be focused on physiological and psychological status and change identification through real time data acquisition, mining, and analysis. As such, the SmartOphthalmicsTM overarching paradigm of (1) wearable sensors, (2) encrypted data streaming, (3) cloud-based analysis (server-backend), (4) health status analysis, modeling, diagnostics, and prognostics, and (5) sending back results to the end-user is well-aligned with the mission of the InTelMed Center.

The proposed integrated program has three main thrusts:  1) tool development: hardware and software for fulldomes and core research into how these spaces can be used as interactive theaters and extended to multi-surface environments, as visualization tools and as educational and experiential venues; 2) integration and content development: development of key applications areas including visualization, simulation, complex systems, security, and education; and 3) education and workforce development: building an educated workforce for the new industry and bringing in new communities through new ways to communicate science, enhance learning, and expand the missions and services of these new technologies.

One of the broader impacts of the proposed research is that the consortium will create a new high tech industry within the state of New Mexico, a majority-minority state.  Although New Mexico is home to the national laboratories and other DOD/DOE facilities, it ranks at the bottom of most economic indicators. The University of New Mexico (a Hispanic-serving institution) will join the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA) (one of three congressionally chartered institutions of higher education and an accredited tribal institution) to share the facilities and expertise developed through this project.  The proposed project will leverage the experience with the NSF PFI sponsored 'Digital Pueblo Project' (0227806) which helped to lay the foundation for the growing digital media industry in the state of New Mexico.  Finally, this work will broaden the usability of fulldome technologies to a wider range of spaces that can be used to educate the general population in STEM-related areas.
 
Partners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: University of New Mexico (UNM) (lead institution), Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA); Research Institute: Santa Fe Institute; and Private Sector Organizations: Institute for the Study and Integration of Graphical Heritage Techniques, Santa Fe Complex (Redfish Group and Los Alamos Visual Analytics), and Sky Scan.",,,"The purpose of this project was to explore the potential of digital fulldome and other immersive technologies, such as ""multi-surface"" displays.  Digital fulldomes (like those we see in planetariums or sometimes in IMAX theaters) are an important technology because they naturally immerse the audience by surrounding their peripheral vision with visual content.  This proposal sought to examine ways to make fulldome technology more effective by trying to make it easier to develop dome content.  One of the key outcomes was the development of the DomeGL API which enables standard OpenGL applications to be mapped fairly easily to dome environments (see attached picture).

We also sought to address the ""chicken-and-egg"" problem that can afflict new kinds of media technologies: no one makes dome content because there aren't enough users with domes to view the content, and users don't set up domes because there is not enough interesting content out there.  To get around this problem, we began examining (1) ways to make dome technology cheaper, more affordable, and easier to set up, and (2) develop ways to project illumination onto arbitrary surfaces to turn any room environment into an immersive ""theater"" to view dome content.  By allowing consumers to view dome content in their living room (something we call ""multi-surface displays""), it effectively creates an ""instant market"" for dome productions that would stimulate the growth of this industry.

In order to allow the display of content on arbitrary surfaces, we needed to develop calibration algorithms to adjust the projection of the content so that it would look correct from the user's point of view (see attached picture).

We also developed new hardware interfaces for immersive displays, such as a skateboard interface and an actuated platform (see attached picture).  These interfaces provide more intuitive interaction since traditional interfaces (e.g., mouse or keyboard) do not work well for immersive displays).

In terms of the educational plan, this PFI effort had a strong educational component that integrated the proposed research effort with a set of educational/outreach activities to help disseminate the ideas developed and help train the next-generation of engineers, scientists, and artists that would work on dome technology.  Some of the outcomes here included the development of a new curriculum in dome technology development at our partner institution IAIA which is motivating a new generation of underrepresented students into taking more advanced courses in science and mathematics.  A digital fulldome was also completed at IAIA that is being used to teach courses in immersive technology.

This two year grant was very successful because it ignited a lot of interest in fulldome technology and opened new directions for applications and technologies which we are just starting to explore.

This Collaboration for Leveraging Energy and Nanotechnology (CLEAN) focuses on specific efforts that include: 1) fostering of extensive information exchange amongst industry, university, and government stakeholders; 2) expanding knowledge transfer through the Nanotech Innovation in Renewable Energy (NIRE) efforts; and 3) creating a workforce development program based on industry needs. These activities, managed by the Energy and Environmental Technology Application Center (E2TAC) at CNSE, accelerate the integration of nanotechnology in alternative energy technologies among businesses located in the Tech Valley Region of Upstate New York. Drawing on cutting edge research in nanotechnology and the capability of many of the nation's leading advanced energy technology businesses that utilize nanotechnology, the project provides increased organization and coordination that is needed to share and communicate the industry's most pressing needs to academia and to transfer the most appropriate technologies from academia to industry.  

Through its outreach and Energy Innovation Camp, the project will present to the public and key stakeholders from legislators to high school students the importance, challenges, and opportunities of developing clean energy technologies. Through its Energy Test Farm, the project will provide an opportunity for workforce training and education by facilitating competency to develop, install, maintain, and service high tech energy related equipment such as solar cells, fuel cells, and energy efficiency devices through established training programs. The ability to provide this expertise to manufacturing and end-user organizations will serve to accelerate deployment of these new technologies. The project leverages significant physical and research infrastructure that is in place at CNSE to grow the regional economy. By 2015, New York's target is to supply 45 percent of its electricity needs through improved energy efficiency and clean renewable energy. Within the rich context of nanotechnology education and outreach at CNSE, this project focuses on applying nanotechnology to ""clean energy related applications"" and in so doing, it has the potential to make major contributions to New York's ""45 by 15"" program, one of the most aggressive and ambitious clean energy goals in the nation.

Outcome: The Department of Energy (DOE) awarded $57.5 million in April 2011 to the College of Nanoscale Science &amp; Engineering (CNSE) and its partners to create the U.S. Photovoltaic Manufacturing Consortium (PVMC).

Impact/Benefit: The PVMC will increase the United States? share of the photovoltaic technology and products market, and create thousands of jobs over the next decade. 

Explanation: CNSE leveraged its NSF PFI-supported Collaboration for Leveraging Energy And Nanotechnology (CLEAN)  program funding and expertise in bringing together organizations to secure a grant from National Grid?s Strategic Economic Development Program.  The funding received assisted in marketing and expanding photovoltaic technology in the Capital Region through the establishment of a PV technology manufacturing consortium, specifically focused on next generation thin film solar technology.  Through the National Grid program, which leveraged CLEAN funding, CNSE held meetings, workshops and conferences regionally, nationally and even internationally to attract partners to the consortium (6 alone internationally across Europe and Asia).  In addition, CNSE developed marketing collateral and outreach programs to disseminate to further areas and organizations of interest.

These initial meetings, workshops and conferences laid the groundwork to develop the current Department of Energy (DOE)-sponsored U.S. photovoltaic Manufacturing Consortium (PVMC) based in Albany, NY, featuring over 80 national and international companies focused on developing and deploying next generation photovoltaic technologies.  But for its  demonstrated success in managing programs for institutions such as the National Science Foundation, and the facilities and expertise at CNSE, highlighted and maintained through programs such as CLEAN program, larger-scale funding would likely not materialize, such as the initial investment that would lead to the eventual $57.5M DOE funding to establish the PVMC.


Developing an Innovative Workforce to Tackle Tomorrow?s Energy Needs

Outcome: Since its inception in March 2010, the Energy Innovation Camp, an initiative of the PFI program CLEAN, has provided hands-on learning and experimental activities to over 1,000 K-12 students annually around New York State.

Impact/Benefit: With a focus on female, at-risk, and minority groups, CLEAN has worked to make the STEM areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fun and approachable to students that have historically had low representation in STEM-based careers. 

Explanation: According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion.  The need for skilled workers in this area is expected to only become more acute over time.  

The CLEAN program has developed new and unique approaches to increase student interest and interaction in STEM areas.  Through classroom work, designed with local high schools, and hands-on laboratory activities at the CNSE?s Albany NanoTech Complex, students explore the promise and potential of nanotechnology to enable advanced technologies that will positively impact fields ranging from electronics, energy and the environment to health care, military and information technology, among many others. 

Throughout the year, students engage in a variety of hands-on activities that utilized CNSE?s state-of-the-art laboratories and world-class cleanrooms, exploring integrated circuit technologies through nanoscale patterning and fabrication; nanobiomedical applications, including innovations in  nanomedicine; clean energy technologies, such as solar cells, fuel cells, and ultracapacitors for energy storage; and nanoeconomics.

The multimodal membranes are important because they will help to get biologics to market faster where they are needed to service the large and growing population of patients with long-term, chronic conditions such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune disorders. The project will result in research-scale, cation-exchange multimodal membrane chromatography (CEX-MMC) column prototypes. This CEX-MMC column has the following unique features: rapid purification of biologics, tolerance of feedstock ionic strength, high biologics binding capacity, and disposability. These features increase productivity and decrease purification costs of biologics by reducing processing times and number of steps, the costs of consumables, and fixed capital expenses when compared to the leading competing chromatography columns in this market space.  Market entry will result from use of these products in research and early stage development laboratories, where purification speed is essential and customers are willing to try new technologies.

This project addresses remaining technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The first generation CEX-MMC developed in the NSF lineage award demonstrated unprecedented protein binding capacity at high ionic strength. Dynamic binding capacity results showed that the CEX-MMC column has high productivity; however, protein binding kinetics must be improved. In this project, new membrane coatings will be designed to enhance protein binding kinetics. In addition, nearly all performance data have been collected using pure-component protein solutions and low titer cell culture supernatant, and almost no work has been done to quantify biological activity of the product or removal of aggregates and other impurities. In this project, antibody media will be prepared using commercial cell lines and used to collect these essential performance data. Two biopharmaceutical companies have committed to collaboration for assessing the performance of the prototypes using industry representative process parameters and monoclonal antibody feed streams. Evaluation of protein recovery, purity, and removal of protein aggregates will be measured following the CEX-MMC column purification step. These are critical performance measures that need to be determined for the Minimally Viable Product (MVP) prior to commercialization. 

Strategic commercialization and educational plans are designed to validate remaining parts of the business model canvas and create new networks among inventors, entrepreneurs, potential investors and potential customers. Broader impacts also include training graduate and undergraduate students to better understand technology commercialization and entrepreneurship and pursue careers developing new purification technologies for biomanufacturing. Graduate and undergraduate students will attend lectures on technology commercialization held at CUBEInC, Clemson University's life science incubator. A collateral benefit of these lectures is that they will give all project personnel regular opportunities for direct communication with business leaders; entrepreneurs; and potential partners, customers, and investors in the life sciences. Students also will complete a course on technology commercialization designed for engineering students. MBA students will advance understanding of the market value, space, potential customers, and competition landscape and seek collaborations for launch with selected industry partners; and evaluate potential distribution channels and estimate the associated costs. The team will use this knowledge continually to refine the overall strategy for translation of the research discoveries onto a path towards commercialization.",,,"The focus of this PFI AIR-TT project was to translate research discoveries on multimodal membranes towards the commercialization of disposable membrane chromatography column products that address purification challenges in biologics discovery and manufacturing. Chromatography columns based on these research discoveries have been shown to increase purification speed by an order of magnitude or more relative to conventional chromatography columns. Unlike conventional ion-exchange columns that fail to perform at high conductivity, the multimodal membrane columns perform well under such conditions, eliminating the need for intermediate buffer exchange steps often required in the downstream purification process. This technology translation project collected data to help delineate multimodal membrane chromatography column performance. On the membrane materials development side, project personnel tested the hypothesis that introduction of oligo(ethylene oxide) groups into the membrane formulation will increase hydration and chain mobility in water and enhance biologics binding kinetics. In the end, however, no evidence was found to support this hypothesis.

This PFI project had significant broader impacts. The PI's startup company (Purilogics, LLC) executed an exclusive license for the technology from the Clemson University Research Foundation (CURF). A new utility patent application was submitted by CURF to cover additional IP claims based on multimodal chemistry. The commercialization and educational plans in this PFI project were designed to test hypotheses on remaining parts of the business model canvas centered on multimodal membrane technology. Specifically we conducted market and technological analyses, mapped out the competition landscape, and identified potential strategic partners for product launch.

Broader impacts also included training students to better understand technology commercialization and entrepreneurship. A set of educational materials was created on the process of commercializing a new product. These were used in a two-part workshop: Part I covered technology transfer and the pathways involved in intellectual property protection, business development, regulatory review, manufacturing and production, and specific challenges for the project team. Part II covered investors, market risk, technology risk, management risk, and financial risk.

This PFI project provided partial support for two PhD students (one in Chemical Engineering and one in Microbiology), one MBA student, and four undergraduate researchers. Five of these students are women and one is an underrepresented minority. One of the PhD students presented his work on this project at the 2018-19 Three Minute Thesis competition at Clemson University and won 1st place in the graduate student category. The other female PhD student continued to pursue a career in research as a postdoctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins University.

The overall impact of this PFI AIR-TT project is that, when commercialized, multimodal membrane chromatography column products will help manufacturers face emerging challenges that include the need for more selective chromatography media and tolerance of feedstock conditions, while simultaneously increasing productivity. Increases in productivity and improvements in manufacturing flexibility (e.g., rapid changeovers in multidrug facilities) are needed to meet the ever-growing demand for biologics that treat long-term, chronic conditions.

ONAMI and OTRADI are resources for the ""physical"" and ""technical"" aspects of commercializing an invention; they enable the building and testing of prototypes. The development and implementation of a plan that brings an invention to market needs an additional resource, the intervention of experienced business entrepreneurs. OSUs model for screening and incubating new business opportunities from laboratory concepts addresses many of the roadblocks associated with university commercialization.  One of the features of the model is the early direct involvement of seasoned entrepreneurs. Indeed, the full panoply of pertinent non-academic players are to be brought onto the university campus and protocols for interaction with, and education of researchers, students, and administrators will be implemented, studied, and further developed. So far, more startups have been created in the two years of the pilot program than had been created in the history of OSU.
 
OCI will accelerate the development of an entrepreneurial culture at several research universities. The research team and business students will study the impact of OCI and publish their findings.

In so doing, it will enable the Oregon universities to recruit and retain better students and better professors. The proposed activity will benefit society by generating jobs, creating wealth, and improving both the standard of living and the quality of life in the Pacific Northwest. OCI will create tool kits which will enable universities to replicate its achievements in other regions.

Project History
This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project-- NSF Award #IIP- 0917948 sought to build upon the Western Innovation Initiative (WII), a pilot program which was underway at Oregon State University and The University of Utah, in order to catalyze commercialization efforts in by leveraging lessons learned and existing assets so as to create a broader program with greater impact.
Thus we will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning. We will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by supporting the efforts of researchers to commercialize their discoveries. In so doing, it will enable universities to recruit and retain better students and better professors. The proposed activity will benefit society by generating jobs, creating wealth, and improving both the standard of living and the quality of life. We will create tool which will enable universities to replicate achievements from within the innovation ecosystem. The team studied the impact of WII published their findings in a white paper which was delivered at several conferences and proceeded to deliver a solution.
Goal of the project
To bring a community together creating a network of people, resources, and expertise that enables the exploitation of university technologies and resources for the purpose of economic development benefiting both the universities and their respective communities.
The result - What is WIN?
WIN is the World Innovation Network, a dynamic collaboration platform used by universities, industry, trade organizations, entrepreneurs and individuals. WIN is a place for problems to meet solutions, offering access to:

Cutting-edge research and production equipment
Specialized services
Research and subject-matter experts
Research innovation

The Why behind WIN
Static listings of equipment, resumes, IP and capabilities don?t provide a compelling reason to visit other innovation websites. The WIN creates a dynamic and customizable community for each member, providing easy access to a broad range of resources and topics - from research universities to global corporations to individuals. The Why behind WIN comes from the benefits that flow to WIN members from WIN membership.  Those benefits include:
For the University: Membership in WIN offers the heightened participation of the university in a complete innovation ecosystem. Exposing a university's capabilities, either talent-based capabilities or unique equipment and technologies, enables a broad community to engage the university and take advantage of those capabilities. This creates opportunities in sponsored research, student internships/scholarships, resource support, and reduced equipment overhead and idle time - critical in this era of tightened budgets and oversight. Additionally, creating a place for industry to interface with university resources also brings an industry influence to university education and research resulting in greater industry relevance in both student training and research projects.
For Industry: Whether small business or multi-national industry, WIN means ready access to expertise, unique resources and services, talent and cutting-edge innovation. Universities hold an amazing amount of ""innovation capital,"" and WIN is the network built to guide the industry user in discovering, accessing, and leveraging this capital.
For the Individual Faculty Member: WIN is a network of people and resources built to both enable a researcher's discoveries and utilize those discoveries. The result - more impact for the researcher's work - whether this is the innovation a researcher creates or the individuals trained during research. In addition, researchers can find their next collaborator in WIN and will have direct access to a global network of entrepreneurs, investors and industry partners..
For the Innovation Ecosystem: High Tech companies create valuable jobs.  To ...",THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH

CWRU and four small businesses in the specialty materials from renewables technology space will join together to explore a new model of cooperation with potential to change the way researchers and small businesses work together in this platform. This will result in more productive innovation capacity building to serve as preparation for enabling movement into the marketplace. The small business partners are located in N.E. Ohio and are a part of a synergistic cluster that will later serve to enhance opportunities for the development and commercialization of novel applications. Research teams include partner companies, CWRU faculty, PhD students, and Master of Engineering and Management students, who will bridge technology and business issues.  An additional partner, SRI International, known internationally for its disciplined innovation process, will lead the research teams through collaborative activities key to their innovation training.  Through this PFI, the small businesses will have the opportunity to collaborate on innovative technologies with each other and CWRU; two out of the four companies have not had significant prior interaction with universities. Moreover, the identified faculty members who will be working with them will be actively growing their research activities in this field.  Consequently, this PFI is enabling the emergence of a cluster in specialty materials from renewable resources that will foster innovative and high impact research and development in the region. 

The broader impacts of this research are as follows:  (1) to train a new generation of PhD researchers to deeply consider market and societal needs in the context of their research and thus contribute more productively in a global innovation economy, (2) develop and sustain new and productive paths of interaction between a major research university and small companies, leading to the building of innovation capacity in the region and a model that can be widely utilized, and (3) enhance the development and deployment of technologies based on renewable resources which will contribute positively to both economic growth and national security.

Intellectual Merit: Significant progress was made in four broad areas, including an understanding of fire resistance of selected species of freshwater algae, the development of novel fire-resistant materials from renewable resources, an improved understanding of chemical compostions of fuels and biochar derived from renewable sources, and novel additives for windows and asphalt to improve sustainability of infrastructure (e.g., roads) and energy efficiency of buildings.  Several of these projects are continuing after PFI funding expired due to continuing intellectual interest coupled with exciting commercial potential. 

Broader Impacts: In addition to potential commercial opportunities, a key broader impact is the deliberate encouragement of an innovation and entrepreneurial mindset among students and faculty.  Innovation - the delivery of value in the marketplace - is a discipline in itself and involves much more than excellence in science and engineering. Needed key skills include communication, teamwork, project management, and an appreciation of tight timelines for project deliverables.  An innovation mindset is a life skill, and there is a broad commitment to instill this in students across CWRU.  The economic prosperity of the the U.S. depends on innovation, and hence this broad impact is expected to be significant.

The MIT-based intellectual home of the workshop will be the Sociotechnical Systems Research Center in the School of Engineering. Sixty researchers from around the country in fields such as systems engineering, computer science, and cognitive engineering/human factors will participate. Technology-based innovations in service systems could have enormous economic importance for the U.S.  Service systems contribute to 75% of the U.S. GDP and provide close to 80% of employment. Innovative services involving smart technologies have the potential to become the conduit for social innovations addressing major societal problems. To achieve this goal, they are to be designed with the human user or beneficiary in mind. Engineering the systems of the future will require interdisciplinary work involving disciplines that understand human factors (such as cognitive engineering and behavioral science) together with those that understand the technology and appropriate engineering design (such as computer science and systems engineering).

Already, NSF is contributing to the realization of this vision through its initial investments in translational research by the 2014 PFI:BIC program solicitation (NSF 13-587) focused for the first time on the integration of smart technologies into service systems requiring a human factors engineering component. However, to accelerate innovation in smart service systems with major societal impact, it is essential that investments be made not only in the technologies that can enable smarter systems, but also in understanding the behavior of the socio-technical systems and how different design alternatives can generate different system behaviors.  This is clearly an interdisciplinary fundamental research challenge that involves several disciplines to generate knowledge at the intersection of those fields.

The Workshop will convene experts from multiple scientific fields in academe, industry, and government:
1) To provide a venue for potential PFI:BIC proposers as well as for current PFI:BIC awardees to exchange ideas and interact with industry representatives in the interest of enhancing success in the program.  Invited industry representatives will bring their service innovation research challenges to the table and will present the types of research problems that lend themselves to academe-industry partnerships in smart service systems.
(2) To present the state of the art in the fields related to service science and modeling/designing complex service systems, thus providing context for the identification of fundamental research problems that will cross disciplinary boundaries. This is the starting point for identifying the gaps that need to be filled in order to advance the frontier.
(3) To elicit fundamental research challenges (basic understanding and modeling) that need to be addressed to enable human-centered and technology-based smart service systems; and engineering and computer science research challenges that need to be addressed to advance technologies with potential for broader societal  impact in the context of social innovation based on service systems.
(4) To develop a vision and a well-defined fundamental research agenda that includes research goals, research objectives, and a research plan for service systems. The research plan should delineate roles for the different disciplines and a clear motivation to work together; including engineers, cognitive or behavioral scientists and computer scientists.

Smarter Service Systems through Innovation Partnerships &amp;Transdisciplinary Research

November 20, 21, 2014

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139

The service sector is the driving engine of the US economy, contributing 80% of GDP and employing the majority of high-skill workers. Health, education, transportation, telecommunication, and utilities are but a few examples. These are complex sociotechnical systems comprising technologies, people, organizations, and information that provide services, creating value. Sustained economic growth requires research directed atfundamental understanding and improvement of these systems, leading to engineering of new transformative ""smarter"" service systems.

This two-day NSF-sponsored workshop brought together 100 individuals &ndash; academics, private sector leaders, government professionals and NSF leadership &ndash; to move us closer to a new exciting problem framing and research agenda setting for Smart Service Systems. The participants included eleven teams recently funded by NSF for their innovative Smart Service systems research programs.

The Workshop was a concrete step toward a new discipline of service systems engineering. It was held at Le M&eacute;ridien Cambridge-MIT Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts on November 20-21, 2014. The organizing committee consisted of Richard Larson of MIT (chair), Kent Larson of MIT, William Rouse of Stevens Institute of Technology and James Spohrer of IBM.

The workshop?s 100 participants from academia, industry and government engaged in a vibrant discussion of the requirements for, challenges to and promise of, service systems engineering. MIT Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart welcomed the attendees and noted that the NSF program is playing an important role in allowing society to bring science and engineering to bear on today?s grand challenges.

The first day focused on academic-industry collaboration and the second day focused on transdisciplinary research. Each day began with a presentation by NSF leadership about the NSF?s goals for a science of smart service systems. The first day also featured poster presentations by the eleven 2014 grantees under the NSF?s Partnerships for Innovation:Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) program, which fosters partnerships that integrate technologies into a human-centered smart service system ""with the potential to achieve transformational change in an existing service system or to spur an entirely new service system.""

The workshop many sessions spanned a range of topics, including specific research projects in smart service systems; challenges in studying, modeling and designing smart service systems; and descriptions of academic-industry partnerships. The workshop also included a breakout session in which teams addressed a challenge by the NSF to explore the potential for fundamental interdisciplinary research in the realm of smart service systems.

A key goal was to move towards creation of service systems that make intelligent use of technology, impedance-matched to the needs and responses of humans, thereby maximizing their impact. The technologies &ndash; both hardware and software &ndash; encompass virtually all fields of engineering. They include information extraction and interpretation from sensors, actuators, smart phones, and people. They include robotics, machine learning and industrial engineering. Real-time technology adaptation, customization and personalization are increasingly important. As we go forward, research will range from small to large, from finely balanced one-on-one bi-directional human-technology interactions to the agile adaptation of larger ?systems of systems?. Creating integrative technologies that match with people?s needs and capabilities is key for productivity growth and higher quality of life.

Our glass capacitor technology has market-valued features including miniaturization and high-temperature operation.  These features provide more compact and reliable power conversion systems in electric vehicles and higher temperature electric systems for energy exploration when compared to the leading polymer film capacitors in this market space.   This glass capacitor technology is important because it will lead to higher performance, lower cost and more reliable hybrid electric and plug-in electric vehicles.  

The innovation ecosystem that will be enhanced includes Penn State University, PolyK and the Department of Energy.  Penn State provides fundamental process and property knowledge of glass materials. PolyK is a startup company with a focus on the development and commercialization of advanced dielectric materials and smart materials.  The Department of Energy Office of Vehicle Technologies supports industry and national labs in the development of power electronics for hybrid vehicles.  The potential economic impact is expected to be the development of new high-temperature capacitors over the next three years. Graduate and undergraduate students will gain entrepreneurial and technology translation experience through learning about the supply chain from materials to components to systems.   In addition, students will learn about the intellectual property process from the invention disclosure to the issued patent.

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  This project will establish the scientific and engineering foundations to deliver power electronic capacitors with high energy densities and reliable operation under harsh environments. Over the past decade, the display industry has revolutionized the production of thin glass sheet by down-draw methods.  A quite unexpected application has been found for thin glass dielectrics in the energy conversion arena. The research challenge for new energy storage materials can be distilled into a single figure-of-merit energy density, which captures the vital materials parameters of relative permittivity and dielectric breakdown strength (electric field).  Recently, it has been discovered that glass has among the highest energy densities (up to 35 J/cm3) among all dielectric materials, which will allow for significant capacitor miniaturization.   Glass becomes very flexible as the thickness decreases to the point where roll-to-roll processes becomes possible for manufacturing capacitors.","Dash, Priyanka., Yuan, Mengxue, Gao, Jun, Furman, Eugene and Lanagan, Michael~High electric field conduction in low-alkali boroaluminosilicate glass~Journal of Applied Physics~123~2018~~~~0~ ~0~ ~21/01/2019 12:13:25.683000000, Wilke, Rudeger HT, Amanda Baker, Harlan Brown-Shaklee, Raegan Johnson-Wilke, Chad Hettler, Takashi Murata, Patrick O?Malley, Steve Perini, and Michael Lanagan~Fabrication of Wound Capacitors using Flexible Alkali-Free Glass~IEEE Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology~6~2016~1555~~IEEE~0~ ~0~ ~06/07/2017 09:54:28.153000000, Li, Bo, Mengxue Yuan, Shihai Zhang, Ramakrishnan Rajagopalan, and Michael T.

Glass becomes flexible as the thickness decreases and roll-to-roll manufacturing becomes possible for creating display and electrical components (see Figure 1).    We have discovered that the electrostatic energy storage capacity of glass is among the highest known for any insulating material. High energy capacitors from thin glass were developed under the Partner for Innovation (PFI) program with the development team: Penn State University, PolyK LLC, and Argonne National Laboratory.

The PFI program is affiliated with the NSF/IUCRC Center for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics.    As part of the PFI program, the team created a polymer coating technology to increase the flexibility of glass substrates (Figure 2).     The coated-glass is incorporated into capacitors to increase reliability at high temperature.   By the end of the program, it was proven that glass is a superior dielectric material in comparison to standard polypropylene for power capacitors.  The high reliability and high temperature operation allows for capacitor miniaturization and that are used in hybrid electric vehicles (Figure 3). 

Intellectual Merit:  Knowledge has been advanced the areas of materials, electronic components and power systems.  Nanoscale polymer coatings on glass were synthesized and the electrical properties were characterized over a broad temperature range.  Fundamental electronic and ionic transport mechanisms were linked to capacitor reliability at high temperature.   The superior electrical and thermal performance of glass in combination with the flexibility of thin glass, provides for the possibility of producing capacitors by a continuous roll-to-roll process.

Broader Impacts: There is general agreement within the automotive and power electronics communities that revolutionary approaches, drawing on diverse disciplines, will be necessary to develop the next generation of power systems.  In addition to renewable energy sources (solar, wind, etc.), hybrid electric vehicles rely on power converters to transform energy from batteries to motors and to the grid.   A major component within the power converter is a DC bus capacitor which contributes a significant fraction of the volume, weight and cost.   The focus of the NSF PFI was to create higher reliability capacitor components for power converters that are used in electric vehicles and renewable energy sources.

(VPI), and advances in material science and manufacturing of composite blades by Energetx Composites, Inc. (ECI) to tackle major technological and environmental roadblocks hindering commercial development and wide-spread deployment of technologies for harnessing MHK energy resources; and 2) contribute toward educating the next generation workforce for the MHK industry with emphasis on Native American students.  A three-pronged research plan is proposed aimed at 1) Designing and testing via fluid-structure interaction computational tools the next generation of MHK turbine rotor blades optimized for reliable and efficient operation in real-life aquatic environments; 2) Optimizing via site-specific computational modeling the layout of VPI's pilot-scale 30-turbine, 1.05MW array to be developed in the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE) site in the East River in New York City; and 3) Developing and demonstrating the utility of the computational tools for quantifying and mitigating environmental effects due to coupled MHK array-geomorphology interactions.  At the core of the educational plan of this project is the collaboration with Salish Kootenai Colleg (SKC), which will seek to enrich the 4-year degree program of this college with technological and entrepreneurial content focused on MHK energy. The computational framework to be used in this project is able to carry out high-resolution simulations of turbulence in arbitrarily complex waterways with embedded natural and/or man-made hydraulic structures and/or MHK turbines and multi-turbine arrays, taking into account hydro-elastic effects of turbine blades, and the interactions between turbines and waterway morphodynamic processes.  This computational framework will be further developed and demonstrated in a real-world MHK project by leveraging the industry-leading expertise and unique field facilities of the two small business partners.  The resulting simulation-based toolbox will be translated to the business partners to provide them for the first time with in depth mechanistic understanding of how turbines perform in and interact with real-life aquatic environments; and a powerful simulation-based engineering science toolbox for site-specific optimization of turbine arrays for efficiency and environmental compatibility.

Technologies for harnessing clean and renewable energy from MHK resources are currently at the pre-commercial stage of development and a number of technological and environmental challenges need to be overcome for this emerging industry to impact the nation's economy and renewable energy portfolio.  Today, the U.S. MHK industry is at a stage similar to the early days of wind power technology prior to the emergence of a viable industry. Due to market pressures confronting small businesses in a nascent industry sector, the innovation capacity of companies like VPI and ECI is seriously impaired.  The proposed PFI will enable both industry partners to leverage unique state-of-the-art simulation tools and emerge as international leaders in the MHK industry.   Furthermore, the success of VPI's highly visible RITE project in New York City will provide a major boost to the entire U.S. MHK industry sector and help accelerate the wide-spread deployment of MHK energy technologies throughout the nation.  The PFI educational plan will provide pilot content for the SKC Hydrology degree program that will uniquely link a Native American reservation with promising new technologies at a point where technology and entrepreneurial development are happening simultaneously; open-up a new potential marketplace for MHK technology in rural communities on a Native American reservation; and pilot this effort as a model for implementation in other rural communities in the U.S. and in third-world countries.

Stony Brook University, brings together a small business-academia innovation team to capitalize on emergent opportunities in thermal spray (TS) deposition of functional oxides for applications in high temperature sensing and electrical energy conversion systems. It has long been appreciated that successful development of functional oxide deposition via TS (a platform technology) would provide an enabling new capability for a high rate, economical approach to large area deposition of components in fuel cells, batteries, and a range of thick film sensors. Many of these inventions have been contemplated for several decades but have not been translated into innovative applications, largely due to the complexity in materials science of TS systems as well as to limitations in process science and control. Over the last decade, much has changed in both knowledge and technology which has resulted in a reconsideration of the capability for functional materials systems. However, in order to push the capability of TS to play an active role in thick film manufacturing, new process science ideologies aimed at improving functional properties and enhancing reliability must be implemented. Furthermore, scientific endeavors in academia must be leveraged with entrepreneurial pursuits in small businesses to demonstrate the viability of TS to meet rigorous requirements in sensor and energy systems. The intellectual merit stems from the ability to introduce academically derived, sophisticated scientific concepts such as advanced diagnostics and process maps into industrial manufacturing practice. Successful development of the proposed technologies through the PFI will not only have immediate impact among the small business innovation partners, but also will provide a framework for consideration of TS expansion into the arena of functional materials. 

The broader impacts of this research are numerous. Successful consideration of TS in sensors and energy systems will open the door to wide ranging opportunities including thick film devices, mesoscale electronics, and photocatalytic surfaces. It has the potential to bring down manufacturing costs and provide scaling for fuel cells and batteries enabling their wide spread utilization. It will also distill confidence in TS technology and enhance capabilities of small business service providers for both traditional and novel applications. Effective interactions among graduate, undergraduate students, and industrial innovators can influence and inspire a spirit of innovation in a generation of both engineering and business students.

The project proved that thermal spray can be effectively developed through rigorous scientific methods for applying functional oxide coating and functional oxide based mesoscale devices.

We have demonstrated through advanced process diagnostics and process mapping concepts that one can correlate the process-functional property correlations that can allow robust developed application development.  The primary application focus is Strontium doped Lanthanum Manganite and Manganese cobalt spinels as electrically conductive protective coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects.  The spinel is the rare-earth free version of such a coating and its development can have implications into manufacturing costs.
We have shown that using processing nuances, one can control the oxygen loss and resultant sub-stoichiometric character of plasma spray TiO2 oxide coatings. Such TiO2-x deposits showed unusual combination of seebeck voltage, reasonable electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. The combined set of properties resulted in a best published achievable thermoelectric figure of merit. The combination of excellent properties, low cost, no toxicity and scalable manufacturing point to a pathway for commercial developments.
In collaboration with our international partners Institute of Plasma Physics, several other dielectric oxides were processed and characterized.
Robust industrial collaboration enabled through the PFI program as well as through Stony Brook?s industrial consortium for thermal spray technology allowed for effective knowledge transfer and continued development of this important field.

The project will produce a pathway for coordination of support for a biomedical innovation economy in an underdeveloped area, the Lowcountry of South Carolina, Charleston, and the surrounding region.  Contributing to the broadening of access and impact is that fact that the College of Charleston is primarily an undergraduate institution.

Genentech is now often considered the founder of the biotechnology industry, but at one point in its history, Genentech was just one more start-up company, with all of the challenges facing a new venture.  The biotechnology industry as a whole is one of the fastest growing sectors in the economy. This is especially true for that subset of biotechnology dealing with health-related issues, biomedical processes, new drug development, and new products for use in medical settings. Put these trends together with the fact that more than 80% of the new jobs created in the United States are created in companies with fewer than 20 employees, and it is easy to see the importance of entrepreneurship for biotechnology. 
 
The broad objectives of the Lowcountry Partnership for Biomedical Innovation were to (a) enhance the local biomedical infrastructure, (b) contribute to the entrepreneurial education of medical research students, (c) assist fledgling biomedical companies, and (d) identify crucial success factors for entrepreneurial start-up ventures.  
 
Over the life of the project several important outcomes have been achieved.
A course on Health Sciences Entrepreneurship (ENTR 451) has been established at the College of Charleston.  This course is cross-listed as Biomedical Commercialization (CGS 729) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and also cross-listed as Biomedical Technology Entrepreneurship (BIOE 850) at Clemson University.  Students from all three schools have participated in interdisciplinary teams to create feasibility studies for products created in the medical research laboratories of MUSC.
The project created a business presentation team for Sphingogene, a company that has invented compounds that can enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy for cancer treatment.  The presentation team represented Sphingogene in the Rady School of Management Student Venture Open, held in conjunction with the WBT Innovation Showcase in 2012.  The team, consisting of graduate research students from MUSC and undergraduate business students from the College of Charleston, won this national competition (picture attached).
 
Much of the project?s research on entrepreneurial characteristics is based on the Panel Studies of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED), two nationally representative databases of people who are in the process of starting businesses.  As part of the project?s enhancement of the entrepreneurial infrastructure generally, we have presented workshops on how to use this complex dataset.  These workshops have been held in the US, France, and the UK for professional audiences of researchers and doctoral students.

In 2013 students in the ENTR 451 produced a complete proposal for an interdisciplinary and inter-institutional (College of Charleston and Medical University of South Carolina) undergraduate major in Healthcare Administration.  This proposal has been shared with the upper administration of both institutions, as one possible way for the two to collaborate to enhance local economic development.  
 
It is a matter of faith among venture investors that the entrepreneurs most likely to succeed are going to be people who are the most highly motivated by a combination of the desire for financial success with a need for personal fulfillment.  Research conducted by the project shows this ""matter of faith"" to be misplaced.  Specifically, when entrepreneurs are in their thirties, the highest-scoring women are actually people who have quit; the highest-scoring men are people who are still trying, but have not successfully created new firms.  The fact that ""pick the highest-scoring"" turns out to be a less-than-winning strategy may be related to the fact that ven...",

This assay system will capitalize on the fact that fish erythrocytes are nucleated and thus have a complete genome to respond to environmental conditions and experimental manipulations. Assessment of the physiological health of fish requires sensitive, accurate tools that can provide rapid assessments and predictive information.

Fish play crucial and multiple roles in human society; they are valued as essential components of the aquatic environment in the U.S.; they are considered biomarkers to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems, and they are important to the sport and recreation industry in the U.S.  What unites the various roles of fish in the environment and human society is that they all depend on production of healthy fish, both in nature and in farms and hatcheries. Testing and development of the proposed EASY-F quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) mini array will have an impact on Native American interests in salmonids directly.  Tribal Groups are co-managers of salmonid fisheries and each tribe operates its own fisheries department.  Successful partnership with tribal stakeholders begins with research collaboration, technology sharing, and data exchange.  Development and validations of the EASY-F system will rely in large part on the direct collaboration of tribal stakeholders.  In turn, the use and commercialization of the EASY-F technology will directly affect tribal interests by providing additional opportunities to train tribal fisheries scientists, raise the level of technological expertise in tribal fisheries departments, and improve information exchange among stakeholders crucial to the co-management of the fisheries.  Ultimately, technology transferred from this project has the potential to influence the management of fish populations affected by disease or other environmental stressors, populations under restoration, and captive populations being enhanced to increase productivity.

Partners at the inception of the project are:  Academic Institutions:  University of Idaho (Moscow and Hagerman, ID) (lead institution), Idaho State University (Pocatello, ID), and University of Chile (Santiago de Chile; Private Sector Organizations: Cooke Aquaculture Inc. (Blacks Harbour, New Brunswick, Canada), Portneuf Regional Medical Center (Pocatello, Idaho); Federal Government Organizations:  Agriculture Research Service, Department of Agriculture; and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Bozeman Fish Technology Center, Bozeman, MT), Department of Interior; and Native American Organization: Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (Portland, OR).

.",,,"Fish are exposed to a variety of challenges in their environment including temperature changes, fluctuating dissolved oxygen concentrations, diminished water quality and toxic algae.  This study measured acute and chronic effects of these challenges on gene expression in red blood cells and on other blood parameters. Fish red blood cells are nucleated, in contrast to red blood cells of mammals. Therefore, fish red blood cells contain chromosomes with genes that respond to changes in the body of the fish associated with environmental challenges. Measuring gene expression changes in fish red blood cells could be a novel way of determining if fish are being affected by changes in their environment and if they are being affected, to what extent? The intent of this project was to develop a commercially useful, less-invasive method to assess stress caused by increasingly common environmental changes. Rainbow trout were used as the test fish and over the course of the project, fish were exposed to a number of environmental stressors and gene expression levels in red blood cells were measured. Many genes were examined, and several genes were found to be excellent specific markers for each of the environmental challenges that were used.

A novel system using dialysis casettes to maintain fish blood cells in a healthy state for extended periods was developed in this project. This system allowed fish red blood cells to be exposed to differing conditions, such as elevated water temperature or low dissolved oxygen levels, without having to subject fish to stressful environments. It also allowed the researchers to examine gene expression responses of red blood cells to environmental conditions independently of other factors that normally occur in the body during stress, such as elevated glucose or cortisol levels. The project developed a unique fish rearing system, called the ""Envirotron,"" where a large number of fish tanks can be supplied with water of variable quality, providing the means to conduct comprehensive and replicated studies of the effects of water quality on fish performance and health.  The use of laser-capture technology was another unique aspect of the project that allowed the collection of individual fish blood cells from blood smears to assess gene expression in different types of blood cells.  Genes in red blood cells that were found to be specific markers for different environmental challenges and are appropriate candidates for developing a commercial test (i.e. Easy-F gene panel) were validated and are now ready to use. Significant impacts in other disciplines for the panel of genes identified in this project to assess stress and well-being in red blood cells include water temperature fluctuation due to global warming/climate change, diverse stressors like pollution, transport, handling, disease or vaccination, or dietary changes. 

In terms of impacts, measuring gene expression in rainbow trout blood cells exposed to varying water quality offers the prospect of using gene expression values as markers for sensitivity or tolerance to low water quality in commercial fish breeding programs The ultimate goal of such programs is develop lines that are more tolerant of low water quality. The project also contributed to fisheries management, particularly with respect to habitat quality. As such, the project benefits Native Americans (as natural resource co-managers) and state, federal and private entities involved in hatchery production and wild fish management.

Most importantly, the project provided training in molecular genetics, biochemistry, experimental design, fish culture and experimental sampling to a range of students.

Building upon a previous housing partnership effort, the project seeks to develop sustainability metrics related to construction operations which can be used by construction companies throughout the nation and beyond.  While the transformation focused upon sustainability in the built environment has certainly touched the construction industry; paradoxically, the construction industry itself has been left out of efforts to encourage green practices.  Metrics for construction operations do not currently exist in any form and construction companies are left to measure their sustainability in their own way.  For the most part, they do no measuring at all. Through discovery and applied research, this project will provide a base upon which sustainable construction operations can be built, measured, weighed, and improved, thereby stimulating significant new research and activity.

Improvements in the environmental performance of construction operations are high on the agenda of many national and global organizations. The long-term goal of this project is to provide the construction industry with a standard protocol that will enable measurement and improvement of the environmental performance of onsite construction processes. Conserving material and energy resources will engender economic benefits to the U.S.  The project will also contribute toward a fundamental understanding of just how our efforts to build the things we build affect the environment in which we live.  Partnership products will enable participation in the discovery process for education groups at all levels, K-12 through university, and for industry groups.

This project represents the initial thrust towards this aspiration. Objectives supporting this goal area:

Identify and quantify process-specific resource and environmental impacts, significant activities and production variables that influence resource consumption and environmental performance
Evaluate alternate onsite construction practices
Develop a framework to measure and improve greenness of onsite construction processes
Disseminate research findings to the construction industry and develop educational modules.


 

All of this is to be developed within the context of continual consideration of the business case for sustainable construction operations.

 

Some specific technologies addressed were the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to power construction vehicles instead of diesel fuel, specifically ready mixed concrete delivery trucks.  While this had some strong potential, the economic difficulties of the construction industry during the study period made progress difficult.  Nevertheless the project developed an analytical took that can be used to evaluate the benefits of replace diesel trucks with CNG as construction picks up again and as the cost of diesel fuel rises relative to CNG. 

 

Considerable progress was also made in understanding the supply chain and the use of recycled concrete materials in construction, as well as byproduct materials such as slag aggregates.  Again, progress was hampered somewhat by the difficult economic climate for the construction industry throughout the latter part of the study period.

Advances in the areas of laser operation, in detection, and knowledge of the detectable chemicals are all being addressed in the Remote Methamphetamine Detection Initiative (REMEDI) partnership, and each advance in these areas will contribute to improving the sensitivity and reducing false positives, which are essential for adoption of the device by law enforcement.
 
The proposed activity is focused on the development of a technology that can assist law enforcement in uncovering meth labs and also alert first responders as to which hazardous chemicals are present.  The societal impact of this activity is of major importance, particularly in Native American tribal communities.  The technology can also be directly extended to remotely detecting other airborne chemicals.

This NSF PFI grant explored the development of compact tunable laser systems for remote chemical sensing in the mid-infrared (3-4 microns) wavelength range.  In this wavelength range, many chemicals have well defined and unique spectral absorption signatures, including chemicals that are the by-products of the production of methamphetamines (meth).  The ability to identify these meth by-products can help in law enforcement in the identification of meth labs and alert first responders to a range of dangerous chemicals (like those in meth labs, as well as other dangerous chemicals) before they enter the contaminated area.
 
The research outcomes of this project include 
1)      1) The development of optical and thermal models and simulators for aiding in the design of the compact pump lasers used in generating mid-infrared light.  The non-linear process chosen for generating tunable mid-infrared light was optical parametric amplification (OPA).  OPA requires a high peak power pulsed laser (operating at 1064 nm) that is single frequency and operates stably at a high repetition rate.  Initially, the heat generated in the laser operation caused mis-alignment the laser and reduced its repetition rate.  High repetition rates are needed to rapidly acquire sufficient data to perform quick identification of chemicals.  Optical and thermal models of the lasers were developed that showed where the heat was generated and dissipated throughout the laser system, the heat- created stresses in the pump laser assembly, and the resultant optical mis-alignments.  These models allowed for thermal designs with better dissipation of the heat generated in the laser operation, hardware designs that reduced the stresses that caused misalignment, and optical designs that were less susceptible to mis-alignment by thermal stresses.  These improvements allowed for successful operation of the laser systems at higher repetition rates.  
2)     2) The development of efficient methods to seed our OPA process to aid in accurate tuning of the mid-infrared light.  The OPA process requires, in addition to the steady pump laser, a seed laser operating at 1.5 microns (telecom wavelengths), which when tuned, tunes the mid-infrared on and off the absorption features of the chemicals of to be detected.  Methods that resulted in broad tuning and high spectral purity were developed.
3)     3) The development, along with our partners, of a database of the chemical by-products of different methods of producing methamphetamine and an assessment of which chemicals were identifiable via remote sensing in the mid-infrared and which wavelengths in the mid-infrared were best suited for identifying these chemicals.  Also developed were chambers for the production and detection of chemical by-products of different meth cook methods.
4)     4) The demonstration of remote sensing of chemicals. A compact seeded pulsed OPA laser and detection system was designed, assembled, and used to remotely scan the mid-infrared chemical absorption profiles.
5)      5) Initial development of continuous wave (non-pulse) mid-infrared laser light generation as an alternative means of remote chemical sensing.  An alternative to remote chemical sensing based on pulsed OPA is one based on continuous mid-infrared light.  Continuous mid-infrared light can be produced by the non-linear optical process of differential frequency generation (DFG).  Commercial continuous wave pump (at 1064 nm) and signal laser (at 1550nm) were shown to produce sufficiently high powers of mid-infrared light via DFG with periodically poled stoichiometric lithium tantalite (PPSLT) as the nonlinear optical medium.

ONAMI and OTRADI are resources for the ""physical"" and ""technical"" aspects of commercializing an invention; they enable the building and testing of prototypes. The development and implementation of a plan that brings an invention to market needs an additional resource, the intervention of experienced business entrepreneurs. OSUs model for screening and incubating new business opportunities from laboratory concepts addresses many of the roadblocks associated with university commercialization.  One of the features of the model is the early direct involvement of seasoned entrepreneurs. Indeed, the full panoply of pertinent non-academic players are to be brought onto the university campus and protocols for interaction with, and education of researchers, students, and administrators will be implemented, studied, and further developed. So far, more startups have been created in the two years of the pilot program than had been created in the history of OSU.
 
OCI will accelerate the development of an entrepreneurial culture at several research universities. The research team and business students will study the impact of OCI and publish their findings. Thus OCI will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning. OCI will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by supporting the efforts of researchers to commercialize their discoveries. In so doing, it will enable the Oregon universities to recruit and retain better students and better professors. The proposed activity will benefit society by generating jobs, creating wealth, and improving both the standard of living and the quality of life in the Pacific Northwest.

Li-ion, the highest-performing commercially available battery technology,  currently accounts for 37% of the $23.5 billion battery market.  However, it has currently reached the maximum performance that physics and chemistry allow.  For the electric vehicle market, these performance limits would require a 1200 lb, $15,000 battery pack in an all-electric sedan, and therefore broad deployment in SUVs, pickup trucks or heavy-duty military or commercial vehicles would be commercially and economically impractical. The envisioned battery technology uses a different chemistry that potentially offers four times better storage capability than Li-ion batteries and is much lighter, leading to new economically feasible electric cars. Through unique partnerships with industry and technology commercialization, this PFI-TT project will enable testing, evaluation & refinement of the proposed technology, production scale-up and a battery prototype.

The proposed project focuses on development of Li-S batteries using a commercially-viable carbonate electrolyte, the liquid responsible for transporting Li+ ions between electrodes. The past R&D efforts for Li-S use ether electrolytes that have low boiling point (~42 degrees C) making them extremely flammable and commercially non-viable. Fundamental investigations on the role of the sulfur phase in altering the reaction mechanism have led to the development of sulfur cathodes that successfully function in carbonate electrolytes - like those used in commercial Li-ion batteries for three decades - with a stable four-fold higher capacity at the material level for 1000+ cycles.  This PFI-TT project will undertake development activities to reduce battery weight and increase sulfur loading based on success metrics provided by potential partners during preliminary customer discovery, with the objective to achieve four-fold improvement in the ""device-level"" specific capacity. The proposed technology will also eliminate dead weight (up to 25% of electrode weight) of binders and current collectors' passive components used in current devices and consequently eliminate slurry processing, a necessary processing step needed for current powder-based electrodes.

Biosensors are key tools in the study of how molecules bind to each other.  Proteins, antibodies, peptides, DNA strands, and medicines all bind and release each other in ways that are critical for human health; and the study of these binding interactions is critical to finding new medicines, detecting diseases, and understanding our own biology.  Better biosensors lead to better health outcomes, and the prototype biosensor developed by this project aims to reveal molecular interactions that are presently hidden to all other types of biosensors currently in use.


The proposed project will achieve this goal using recent innovations in biosensing research.  Specifically, electronic, solid-state biosensors have been successfully commercialized; and compatible single-molecule electronics have been proven to be useful for precision measurements of biochemical activity.  The technical objective of this project will be a proof-of-concept hybrid device that combines conventional ensemble sensing side-by-side with complementary, electronic monitoring of single-molecule binding kinetics.  This combination of simultaneous ensemble and single-molecule monitoring does not exist in any commercial sensor, but it provides new opportunities to break through fundamental limitations faced by all ensemble biosensors.  Specifically, the project hypothesizes that the combined data will extend the biosensor's effective dynamic range and help eliminate false positive and false negative results.  If successful, this type of hybrid sensor could establish a new paradigm where single-molecule data are leveraged in sensors generally to better inform end users in biology, healthcare, and manufacturing.

G. Collins at the Univ. of California, Irvine and Cardea Inc. in San Diego to investigate new techniques in electronic biosensing.

The project was structured around Cardea's Agile R100 product, a novel electronic platform based on graphene transistors that measure protein and antibody binding interactions.  The Collins group, which specializes in the single-molecule limits of electronic sensing, investigated the practicality and commercial opportunities of adding single-molecule sensing to the Agile R100 product.  Specifically, the project was designed to determine whether high-quality single-molecule data could improve the ensemble results from an assay like the Agile R100.  The project was made possible by the shared technological underpinnings of the PI's single-molecule biosensor devices and the Agile R100's graphene transistors.

Over the course of two years, our collaboration tested proof-of-concept modifications that investigated different modes of single-molecule detection.  Single-molecule measurements using UCI's nanoelectronic devices were compared against ensemble results from the Agile R100, providing a fuller characterization of antibody-antigen and protein-protein interactions.  In addition, the single-molecule work helped develop a better understanding of failure mechanisms and electronic responses in the ensemble sensors.  Graduate students working on the project contributed three conference presentations, and the work will result in two peer-reviewed journal publications.  One student completed their Ph.D. dissertation.

In addition to the technical work on single-molecule sensing, this PFI-TT project leveraged NSF's I-Corps and INTERN initiatives.  I-Corps leads teams through product development and customer discovery steps related to their science research, and our team completed a 6-week sequence of I-Corps at UCI.  Another graduate student completed a 9-month internship working on-site with Cardea's scientists.  The I-Corps and INTERN opportunities helped students and one postdoctoral researcher add diverse job skills to their laboratory expertise in nanotechnology and electronic biosensing.

The threshold-logic circuits and the concomitant design methodology is important because, from a user's perspective, it will enable mobile systems such as laptops and smartphones to operate much longer between recharging of the batteries, and reduce their size and weight. It can also lead to reducing the energy usage of bigger systems such as desktop computers, and massive data centers.  From a manufacturer's perspective, it can result in cost savings, improved reliability and more competitive products.  The project will result in enhanced design tools, the design of threshold-logic primitive cells, and the design of a prototype circuit at least one advanced technology node to serve as a proof-of-concept of its robustness and scalability at lower geometries. 

This threshold-logic based digital design technology has the following unique features: (1) a new architecture and method of operation of certain digital circuit primitives, and (2) a new way of incorporating them automatically in larger circuits using existing design tools, i.e., without disrupting the existing design methodologies, so that it can be easily adopted by industry.   These features provide the following advantages: smaller circuits, lower dynamic power consumption, lower standby power consumption, and lower variations in power, all without sacrificing speed, when compared to the leading competing digital ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) technology in this market space. 

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery (successfully demonstrated at 65nm node) toward commercial application: the scalability of the technology and design methodology to advanced (smaller geometries- 40nm, 28nm) technology nodes, including overcoming physical design challenges, maintaining robustness to increased process variations, and scaling the accompanying software tools to industrial-scale circuits. These challenges will be addressed by first developing the circuit libraries in 40nm, which is still a key technology for many companies competing in the $1T IoT (internet of things) market, and then advancing to 28nm in FD-SOI.  The performance and capability of the design software will be enhanced by developing better interfaces to existing commercial design tools, and use of faster software libraries and commercial software platforms.   

In addition, personnel involved in this project,?Ph.D. level graduate students, will continue to receive significant training that requires developing a broad range of design and analytical skills, in multiple technical areas, as well as learning how to meet exacting industrial design standards.  Other activities will include summer internships with companies that have expressed interest in the threshold-logic technology, visiting companies and presenting?and?marketing?the?research?outcomes?to industry.","Wagle, Ankit and Yang, Jinghua and Dengi, Aykut and Vrudhula, Sarma~FPGAs with Reconfigurable Threshold Logic Gates for Improved Performance, Power and Area~Field Programmable Logic~~2018~~~10.1109/FPL.2018.00051~10099615~256 to 2563~10099615~OSTI~26/06/2019 21:01:58.96000000, Yang, Jinghua and Dengi, Aykut and Vrudhula, Sarma~Design Considerations for Energy-Efficient and Variation-Tolerant Nonvolatile Logic~IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems~26~2018~~~10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2812700~10099616~2628 to 2640~10099616~OSTI~26/06/2019 21:01:57.543000000, Wagle, Ankit and Azari, Elham and Vrudhula, Sarma~Embedding Binary Perceptrons in FPGA to improve Area, Power and Performance~International Conference on Computer-Aided Design~~2019~~~10.1109/ICCAD45719.2019.8942071~10131452~1 to 8~10131452~OSTI~21/01/2020 21:01:48.310000000, Ankit Wagle, Gian Singh~Threshold Logic in a Flash~38th IEEE International Conference on Computer Design~~2019~~~~10131456~ ~10131456~OSTI~21/01/2020 21:01:48.400000000",,"Thi project was aimed at designing and fabricating a digital integrated circuit chip in an advanced technology node to serve as a proof-of-concept demonstration of a novel technology that was developed under a previous PFI-BIC grant (#1237856) and NSF ICORPS grant (#1565921).  The outcome of the PFI-BIC grant was a fundamentally new way to design digital circuits.  These are the circuits that go into practically every electronic device that people use and interact with--small, low cost processors in home appliances, to the hundreds of sophisticated processors that are used in cars, planes, smartphones, etc.  The list is practically endless. The new approach to digital system design was a systematic method to embed circuits called binary neurons within digital circuits to simultaneously reduce the power consumption and area of the latter, without sacrificing performance.  The approach included three innovations:

A patented design of a digital circuit architecture that implements a new type of logic primitives referred to as threshold logic gates (TLG);
A patented design of a novel standard cell library of TLGs, which is compatible with conventional cell libraries used by
Commercial synthesis, optimization and physical design tools; and patented algorithms that optimize a logic network for power using a combination of conventional logic gates and TLGs.


The circuit architecture, cell library and technology mapping algorithms were all designed to ensure total compatibility with existing commercial design flows, allowing fully automated synthesis, optimization and final layout using commercial tools. The approach has been demonstrated on large function blocks using state-of-the-art commercial design tools: results showed a 25%-35% reduction in dynamic power, 20%-40% reduction in leakage, and a 10%-25% reduction in area, all without sacrificing performance. The effort resulted in 11 patent applications (5 issued and 6 pending).  While the basic research has been completed under the PFI-BIC grant, and the results show great promise for commercialization, this project  was aimed at eliminating a few challenging barriers that remain before the technology can be commercialized.  The goals of this project were formulated based on the two key outcomes of the ICORPs project. They are

demonstrating robustness of the proposed technology at smaller geometry nodes while ensuring that all the benefits shown for 65nm are indeed retained; 
determine the minimum viable product (MVP) that might be easy to adopt by industry;
demonstrating that the software developed can accommodate industrial-scale circuits.


Our effort to improve the robustness of threshold logic gates led to us to explore threshold logic circuits in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). Their intrinsic reconfigurability provides an almost obvious opportunity to exploit all the advantages of low power and high performance of threshold logic circuits. Toward this end, we developed a new architecture for FPGAs that includes threshold logic cells within the Basic Logic Block (BLE) along with the conventional Lookup Tables (LUT). We demonstrated excellent improvements in performance, power and area of Threshold Logic FPGAs. 

During this (final) reporting period (07/01/2019 - 12/31/2019) we explored a radically different path to improving the robustness of threshold logic gates, while still maintaining their significant advantages in power, performance, and area.  We discovered that the new architecture has the potential for solving a fundamental security problem, namely, the need to prevent the design of integrated circuits (ASIC)  from being stolen when they are disclosed to a foundry for fabrication. 

Thus, our new goal is to market the technology developed under this award as a unique solution to addressing security of ICs, while maintaining all the benefits that were the primary motivation for project in the first place.  The aspect of security that can be addressed here is the prevention of theft of the ASIC design by a foundry.  Existing methods of securing a design come with a very high cost in terms of increased power and area, and reduced performance. We are pleased to report that we have made a significant breakthrough.  The new architecture and design methodology not only results in a dramatic improvement in the robustness of our threshold logic gate circuit (which in turn also vastly expands the set of functions that can be computed by a single cell), but also allows for completely securing the design of an ASIC and preventing a foundry from discovering the function of the circuit. The modified circuit design now allows us to target an entirely different market - namely, the US defense establishment.  The new design provides the US defense industry a perfectly secure way to manufacture its ASICs at any foundry without disclosing the function of the chip.

The smart helmet impact sensing system is important because it will provide information needed to reliably detect head trauma and data for improved performance and training measures which can reduce head, spinal and neck trauma. The project will result in the development of a fully functional prototype of the smart helmet impact sensing system which will be able to monitor the intensity and location of head impacts sustained by athletes in the field. This smart helmet impact sensing system has unique features of being physically flexible, light weight and conformable. These features provide the advantage of being able to seamlessly integrate the system into existing helmets covering the entire helmet interior, thus enabling ""point-of-impact mapping"" of head trauma around the skull that no other system in the market provides. These features differentiate the impact sensing technology when compared to its competitors in this market space, who typically use traditional silicon based manufacturing processes that result in systems that are not flexible, non-conformal, bulky and relatively expensive.

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: (a) developing an in-helmet sensor array for the characterization of impact forces as well as an integrated and miniaturized electronic readout circuit to enable it to fit within a helmet; (b) developing a communication system that can wirelessly send and store impact data; (c) confirming by field testing that the system is mechanically and operationally robust; (d) demonstrating that the system conforms to the Virginia Tech STAR Ratings standards; and (e) understanding the combined effects of the current accelerometer approach to that of impact alone as well as impact-accelerometer combinations.

In addition, personnel involved in this project, a post-doctoral fellow and a graduate student, will receive technology and entrepreneurship translation experiences through: (a) participation in the system development project activities, (b) interactions with the Office of the Vice President of Research (OVPR) office at Western Michigan University for disclosures and patents, (c) developing pitch decks for participating in business pitch competitions, (d) developing a business plan for the commercialization of the smart helmet impact sensing system, (e) participation in developing follow-up grant proposals, and (f) further interactions with research scholars, business professionals, customers and entrepreneurs for licensing, technology transfer and commercialization activities.",,,"This PFI:AIR - TT project was performed by the research group of Prof. Massood Atashbar, at Western Michigan University, to develop an in-helmet sensor array for the characterization of impact forces. The main goals of this project were to: 1) model a capacitive pressure sensor array and electronic readout circuit, 2) fabricate a capacitive pressure sensor array, 3) fabricate a flexible electronic readout circuit, and 4) test the impact sensing system.

Over the course of the project, an array of impact sensors and electronic circuit were fabricated and integrated into football helmets. In the laboratory, a drop-impact testing system that is compatible with the ASTM F429-10 standards was used for testing the performance of the system. Multiple tests performed on different locations (front, front boss, right side, rear boss, rear and top) demonstrated that the instrumented helmet could detect high, medium and low impacts in the sensors corresponding to the impact test locations.

The helmets with the fully integrated system received the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) certification from the Safety Equipment Institute (SEI) test laboratory. Field testing was performed on 10 students in Michigan high schools during the 2017, 2018 and 2019 football practice season. The results and feedback during the field tests demonstrated the mechanical robustness, system performance and comfort fit of the system. The system was able to wirelessly transmit data, from the system to a computer, while the students were practicing on-field. The feedback provided by the students revealed that the students did not feel any difference in the performance of the helmet and did not have any discomfort.

This PFI:AIR - TT project also leveraged NSF's INTERN and REU initiatives which provided one graduate student (INTERN) and two undergraduate students (REU) with additional diverse skills in addition to their laboratory experience. The INTERN received an industrial based training and experience that integrates electrical and computer engineering theory and methodology, with the practical and technical aspects of a research project that is focused on solving a real-world application problem. The REU provided a valuable opportunity for the graduate students to experience a complete product development cycle, by being exposed to different phases of a commercialization-based research project

In summary, the results from this PFI:AIR - TT project is allowing the team to advance the technology from the laboratory to the market by understanding the customer needs. A core team that will develop a business plan and spin out this technology for commercialization is being formed.

The advantage of EDVs lies in the overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution in heavily populated cities. Electric drive vehicles require a power electronics system to operate the motor that ultimately moves the car.  The power electronics system requires DC-link capacitors to properly control the motor in response to speed commands from the driver.  Current DC-link capacitors in the power electronics of EDVs use biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films. However, BOPP film capacitors have relatively low energy density and a low temperature rating of 85?C. Thus, a large volume of BOPP film capacitors and a water-cooling system are necessary in present EDVs, contributing to a high overall cost of the power electronics unit. To overcome this economic disadvantage, it is highly desired to develop new high performance capacitor films, which have a higher energy density and can operate efficiently up to 150 ?C, thus potentially eliminately the cooling system entirely and resulting in a smaller size and mass system.

Supported by the NSF Science and Technology Center, Center for Layered Polymeric Materials (CLiPS), a unique multilayer dielectric film technology was invented at CWRU. In this technology, a high temperature, high breakdown strength, and low loss dielectric polymer (e.g., polycarbonates, PC) is multilayered with a high energy density polymer (e.g., poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF) into a layered configuration using the multilayer coextrusion technique. It is found that high energy density, high temperature tolerance, and low loss dielectric properties can be achieved simultaneously in one system. Therefore, the innovation of this multilayer film technology lies in the fact that without synthesizing and developing new polymers, new dielectric materials can be achieved simply by employing commercially available polymers. Consequently, a shorter commercialization pathway can be anticipated. On the basis of existing results on PC/PVDF multilayer films, this project aims to replace PVDF with a class of cheaper, but still high energy density, even-numbered nylons in multilayer films with high temperature PC. Preliminary results indicate that high energy density, high temperature tolerance, and low loss can also be achieved in the PC/nylon multilayer films.

In this project, a PFI AIR team, comprised of CWRU and two small businesses: PolymerPlus, LLC and SB Electronics, Inc. (SBE), proposes to translate the PC/nylon multilayer dielectric film technology into high temperature and high performance DC-link capacitors for EDVs. Specifically, CWRU will carry out film-level fundamental research to determine the optimal formulation of the PC/nylon multilayer films. PolymerPlus will use this formulation and scale up the film production into wrinkle-free film rolls. After appropriate metallization, PolymerPlus will supply the metallized film rolls to SBE to package into prototype film capacitors. The performance of these capacitor prototypes in comparison with BOPP capacitors will be tested by the team. This research project will offer ideal training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students because they can work with experts in the two small business companies and learn the technology translation and commercialization pathways. If successful, the team will be able to use the outcomes from this project and connect to EDV manufacturers for further commercialization of the multilayer dielectric film technology.","Li, Zhenpeng and Chen, Xinyue and Zhang, Ci and Baer, Eric and Langhe, Deepak and Ponting, Michael and Brubaker, Michael and Hosking, Terry and Li, Ruipeng and Fukuto, Masafumi and Zhu, Lei~High Dielectric Constant Polycarbonate/Nylon Multilayer Films Capacitors with Self-Healing Capability~ACS Applied Polymer Materials~1~2019~~~10.1021/acsapm.9b00099~10092201~867 to 875~10092201~OSTI~26/04/2019 01:02:02.146000000",,"Because of reduced carbon emission, electric vehicles have become increasingly important in the automobile market. Polymer film capacitor is an essential component for powerful and efficient electric drive. Currently, biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film capacitors are used in the power electronics. However, they have a temperature rating of only 85 ?C, much lower than the ambient temperature of 140 ?C in the power electronic unit. This requires a second water-cooling system, which adds additional cost, weight, and energy consumption. To solve this issue, high temperature, high energy density, and low loss dielectric polymer films are desired.

The focus of this Partnership for Innovation (PFI) project is to develop high temperature, high energy density, and low loss polymer film capacitors for electric vehicle applications based on the polymer multilayer film technology developed at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). These multilayer films consist of alternating layers of two different polymers, polycarbonate (PC) and nylon. The unique multilayered structure can provide high energy density, low dielectric loss, and high temperature tolerance simultaneously.

The most important outcome of this project is the development and prototype-level production of the self-healable multilayer film capacitors. Close collaboration among CWRU and two small business companies, PolymerPlus, and SBE, leads to scale-up of capacitor-grade multilayer films, metallization, and winding of film capacitor prototypes. This research is not possible without this close collaboration.

Intellectual Merit: Through the fundamental research at CWRU, the processing condition and optimal formulation of PC/nylon multilayer films are determined: a volume ratio of 70/30 for PC to nylon with a film thickness of 8 microns. PolymerPlus scales up the manufacturing of these multilayer films. After metallization, SBE packages them into wound capacitor prototypes. In addition to the high temperature, high energy, and low loss property, these PC/nylon multilayer film capacitors also exhibit unique self-healing capability, which is a critical requirement for safe and long life capacitors. This PFI project has laid the foundation for next generation high temperature polymer film capacitors.

Broader impacts: The closely collaborating partnership model has been established among CWRU, PoymerPlus, and SBE. PhD students are trained in both academic and industrial environments. This brings together the gap between academic institutions and industry, and is instrumental in accelerating technology transfer for future polymer film capacitors. If successful, this project will impact the power electronics technology for electric vehicles.

This project focuses on technology translation of an intelligent online tutor, named MathSpring, which is important because it provides adaptive and personalized responses to students and teaches by matching the learning needs of individual students with effective teaching approaches. It applies theoretical understanding of cognitive, metacognitive and affective student characteristics to each tutor response. The MathSpring Tutor is also important because no online tutor today responds by analyzing both student knowledge and behavior. This PFI:AIR-TT project will result in a scale-up of the MathSpring Tutor and provide advantages in the marketplace by capitalizing on the general appeal of animation and humanoid characters that talk to students about the importance of perseverance and effort. The project will also provide low-cost, quality solutions for a wide range of students, adaptive tutoring based on student models, just-in-time verbal and animated interactions designed to move students away from boredom or disengagement, and the capability to select from among potentially 700 problems in the system. 

These features of the MathSpring tutor provide improved performance, efficiency and efficacy when compared to classroom teaching or to the leading competing technology, primarily drill and practice problems, videos of lectures or games in this market space.  The potential economic impact of translating this technology to the market place will positively contribute to the growth rate of eLearning within the next 5 years and to the U.S. competitiveness in the eLearning domain. Since the annual U.S. education expenditure for K-12 is approximately $625 billion, a large potential exists for making both a commercial and social impact in this space.  Potential outcomes include: personalized tutors that guide students into their own zone or state of ?flow?; identification of target educational markets; and reaching any student with access to a computer and an Internet connection.

This PFI project addresses the following technology gaps as the software is translated from research discovery toward commercial application: identification of tutor responses that are effective for students in distress (e.g., bored, unmotivated); building sufficient content so the tutor can be used through an entire semester in Grades 5-9; and providing tools that enable teachers to select math problem based on the Common Core curriculum. The project work also includes hardening the tutor, porting it to two platforms (e.g., Android, IOS) and identifying consortia of schools (e.g., linked by geography, or pedagogy) for long-term partnerships. 

Personnel involved in this project, e.g., graduate students and programmers, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through efforts to identify paths through the idiosyncratic school procurement process and the communication of the efficacy studies arising from credible evaluation of MathSpring. The project engages CarneyLabs to guide commercial aspects of the translation and Virginia Advanced Studies Strategies (VASS), a non-profit company that works with the Virginia Department of Education (DoED), to provide a test environment in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.","Naomi Wixon, Sarah Schultz, Danielle Allessio, Kasia Muldner, Winslow Burlesson, Beverly Woolf, and Ivon Arroyo1~?When the Going Gets Tough??: Challenge, Emotions, & Difference of Perspective~13th International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems~13~2016~30~~~0~ ~0~ ~31/05/2016 16:56:01.320000000",,"Intellectual merit. This PFI: AIR TT project focused on technology transfer of NSF sponsored online instructional systems into the market place and ultimately into daily use in US schools. We focused on scaling-up MathSpring, an NSF sponsored intelligent tutor that recognizes a student?s cognitive, social and affective levels. We also enhanced the MARi personal platform, that is used with several school districts in Virginia to explore the market space, the market need, the competitive technologies and the potential impact of the proposed technology.   The combined tutor+personal-platform MathSpring+MARi, has several unique features; the system personalizes math problems from among potentially 700 problems based on students? prior knowledge and emotional state. Digital learning companions talk to students about their effort and motivation, communicate about the malleability of intelligence and support students to reason about their own learning. The system is adaptive to each student?s learning needs and provides just-in-time verbal and animated interactions.

To prepare for commercial use of the tutor+personal-platform, we developed 200 new math problems to cover the curriculum for grades 5-8. Every math problem is aligned to a Common Core (CC) standard and every CC standard for grades, 5-8 is included in the tutor, see supporting spreadsheet. Teachers select math problems for students based on grade, or CC standard to be taught. 

The tutor+personal-platform provides continuous monitoring of and interactions with students working with the tutor; it identifies tutor comments that are effective for students in distress (e.g., unengaged, unmotivated). Teachers and parents can redesign the selected problems and specify the type and behavior of animated character.

Broader Impact. We made progress on the market/commercial side of this award. The commercial partner, MARi, LLC has been working with several school districts in Virginia to explore the market space, the market need, competitive technologies and the potential impact of the proposed technology. VASS (Virginia Advanced Study Strategies, Inc, a 501c(3) nonprofit organization has combined with six eligible rural Local Education Agencies (LEA) in Virginia to form the Rural Math Excel Partnership).

MARi is a personal learning platform that brokers personal attributes for an individual?s benefit. After interviewing 38 individuals currently working in high demand jobs, such as electrician, automotive technician, occupational therapy assistant, forestry technician, EMT, firefighter, etc., the math development team created a resource guide for teachers who teach the foundational math course for each career, including Algebra I, Algebra II, Geometry, and Algebra, Functions, Statistics, Probability and Data Analysis.  This platform learns the individual?s academic and career skills and identifies a personalized path to achieve desired destinations.  Based on 10 years of R&amp;D &ndash; backed by a team of data scientists, educators and entrepreneurs, the platform is intended to create actionable teaching. VASS, in partnership with six rural Southside school divisions, local businesses, and parents worked to improve middle and high school students? math skills and better prepare students to pursue critically needed STEM jobs at the technician level or higher. VASS has collaborated with one lead math teacher from each school division to develop instructional materials and training activities pertaining to the ways math is used in technician-level occupations. We expect that the potential economic impact of translating this technology into the market place will contribute to the growth rate in eLearning within the next 5 years. 

Researchers at UMass and MARi, LLC discussed the necessary issues to bring education technology to market: intellectual property protection, licensing opportunities and freedom to operate issues. Within a very crowded online mathematic technology market, our mathematics tutor is unique because it selects math content by analyzing student knowledge and emotion. The annual education expenditure in K12 education has been estimated at approximately $1.3 trillion, and the eLearning K12 market at $5.4 billion. A large potential exists to make both a commercial, as well as a social impact in this space.

This work has regular marketing issues to address, including development of commercial partnerships, marketing strategies, and a long term planning. However, the procurement cycle in public schools presents a key barrier to commercialization. Procurement regulations are cumbersome, and navigating them is difficult, time consuming, and overwhelming. The traditional procurement process is time intensive, bottlenecking the ability to stay current with the latest technologies and curricular offerings. Several themes have been identified to address the procurement process, as indicates by quotation from education stakeholders: ""I fear making the wrong decision;"" ""Innovation is a last resort. It often happens in underperforming schools where there is nothing to lose.""  Districts and teachers have a healthy skepticism of innovation. ""Teachers don?t have pressure to change; they aren?t in regular market conditions.""

We have advanced the state of knowledge of the underlying NSF research discovery toward commercial application via: a prototype/ scale-up development, demonstration and evaluation, with results sufficient to determine initial feasibility and functional limitations of the innovation in the identified market application/opportunity.

Law enforcement agencies and first responders face significant challenges during an emergency event, such as a natural or anthropogenic disaster (earthquake, tsunami, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood, power or nuclear accident, act of war, or terror). One of the major challenges is acting decisively based on available information and considering human factors, making high-quality real-time situational awareness critical to effectively manage and safeguard civilians and in- field personnel. This project focuses on creating a smart emergency-response service system using UAS, both air- and ground-based systems, equipped with state-of-the-art imaging, sensing, and communication systems to provide first response teams with high-quality, real-time information to act decisively and effectively via human-machine interactions. Such a smart service system will guide/escort humans to safety, direct rescue crews to access trapped humans, and provide in-situ communication, medication, water and food, and power. The program will develop the requisite human infrastructure  of  graduate  students  in  mechanical  engineering,  computer  science  and  engineering, electrical engineering, and social psychology. Working together in the interdisciplinary team, students will be exposed to research outside of their respective disciplines and to innovative opportunities for entrepreneurship. A successful smart service system will impact the operations of the public safety sector, and it could be adapted by similar organizations.

The project's objectives include the following: (1) develop and integrate UAS platforms, sensors, imaging and communication systems, and control and path planning algorithms to create a UAS-based smart service system for first response; (2) model the state of humans and infrastructure during a disaster, identify the scene, and create access paths to safety; (3) test prototypes and pursue commercialization opportunities; and (4) educate the public and train first responders on the technology.   The translational research to create the UAS-based smart service system will focus on sensor data fusion, scene identification, modeling of the state of humans, infrastructure and their interactions as well as on the platform for testing and evaluating remediation strategies, communication schemes, and access path planning. Understanding of the system aspects will enable first responders and public safety command personnel to analyze and understand on-scene, active emergency situations through interactive, integrated data analysis and visualization; and give them the ability to sense, predict, and act in a variety of disaster scenes and human socio-psychological conditions.

Partners at the inception of this project are the University of Nevada at Reno (involving faculty across four departments: mechanical engineering, computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, and social psychology); industry partners: two small businesses, Drone America and SpecTIR, companies based out of Reno, Nevada; academic partners: University of Nevada, Las Vegas; and the University of Utah as well as experts from the UNR Seismology Lab and the Washoe County as System users; and broader context partners include the newly established Nevada Advanced Autonomous Systems Innovation Center (NAASIC) at UNR, the state-supported UAS program management office, Nevada Institute for Autonomous Systems (NIAS), and the Nevada Industry Excellence (NVIE).","Ann E.

This PFI:BIC project was a collaboration between researchers at the University of Utah, the University of Nevada &ndash; Reno, the University of Nevada &ndash; Las Vegas, unmanned autonomous systems industry partner Drone America, and local public safety experts.  The goal was to enhance the situational awareness capabilities of first responders by employing UAS (e.g., drones) with advanced sensing and motion control capabilities for disaster remediation.  This project included the development and testing of the first comprehensive instrument designed to assess public attitudes toward non-military uses of drones, as well as perceptions of the legality of these uses. These instruments can be used to examine trends and encourage future replications by other researchers.

The key research outcomes include: (1) the development of UAS platforms, collision avoidance technology, and vision-based estimation and control technology for GPS-denied environments that enhances the application of UAS for search and rescue, by providing more user friendly systems for deployment; (2) the development of horizon-line detection for UAV localization and human detection from 2D aerial images that assist first responders in decision making by improving their situational awareness; (3) the development of a mobile sensor network to enable cooperative localization of different types of stationary or moving contaminant sources; and (4) longitudinal studies of public attitudes toward the civilian use of drones where results can inform decision makers as they begin to develop or refine policies governing the use of drones.  In particular, this project included discussions with groups of first responders from emergency planning agencies to determine their concerns and experiences with using drones in dealing with natural disasters, as well as their perceptions of public attitudes toward the use of drones in disaster mitigation, and concerns about security, privacy, and danger posed by drones.  In addition, national surveys were conducted online with the public each summer from 2015 to 2018 in order to examine social acceptance of a wide variety of non-military uses of drones, perceptions of the legality of these uses, as well as the perceived risks and benefits of drones for society.  Survey results on UAS design and appearance can be used by designers of drones to create models that, when used in natural disasters, may encourage greater confidence and cooperation from individuals in need of rescue when confronted with the opportunity for drone assistance.

 The PFI:BIC team produced conference papers and publications disseminating research outcomes during each year of the project. 

 Beyond the technical achievements, this project involved over fourteen graduate students and over fifteen undergraduate students across the three institutions.  Students at all levels received training in robotics, control engineering, algorithm development and implementation, and data analysis.  The students involved also co-authored technical publications that were presented at professional meetings and published archival journals.

These materials will be developed through the industrial partnerships that provide them with a competitive advantage in burgeoning niche markets available for such devices. The use of the hydride vapor phase epitaxy growth of GaAs and related compounds provides the capability to create new types of substrates, 'virtual' substrates, which serve as new device, and hence, manufacturing platforms for optoelectronic devices. The high achieved growth rates and control over composition has enabled the formation of semiconductor substrates with a surface that can have a lattice parameter not accessible by commercially available bulk semiconductor substrates. These ultra-thick metamorphic buffer layers transition between a commercial substrate and an epitaxial surface layer which have differing lattice parameters. The resulting surface lattice parameter is tunable, enabling new classes of devices spanning the spectrum for the industrial partners from solar cells to high-performance quantum cascade lasers. The partnerships developed in this project allow for the development of a new capacity for translational research at UW-M through the integration of materials development, with intimate feedback from the industrial partners in terms of design and materials metrics that arerequired for the use of such new materials.

The broader impacts of this project result from 1) the impact on technologies that benefit society, create new markets, and provide unique materials for market entry in the area of optoelectronic devices; 2) the human capital acquired by the participants, especially the graduate and undergraduate students; and 3) the inclusion of undergraduate interns in an environment where the impact of engineering and the generation of new products are readily apparent. This proposal serves to drive these industrial-academic interactions towards the mindful development of other materials built on a new perspective of technology transfer. Industrial partners gain access to materials enabling classes of devices resulting in the expansion of the markets for high performance and specialized semiconductor optoelectronic devices. This partnership will bring to an enhanced level of utility and development a class of 'virtual' and potentially re-usable substrates enabling the widespread development of novel classes of devices previously unachievable through the use of current commercial substrates. The formation, preparation, and processing of these new substrates is carried out in the context of their end-use in the areas of high-performance quantum cascade lasers, new quantum well infrared solid-state lasers, and high-performance multi-junction solar cells. The co-development of these materials by UW-M and the industrial partners will demonstrate and enable optoelectronic devices no longer constrained by lattice-matching to commercial substrates. The UW-M researchers gain knowledge of the design of materials based on the understanding of the product development cycle and those key technological issues which must be addressed to impact new markets.

Often this structural matching is a matter of finding materials that have the same lattice parameters for their crystal structure as Si, GaAs or InP. However, there are many semiconductor materials with attractive properties that do not have these lattice parameters. The major goals of this project were to develop alternative substrates that both ameliorate the lattice parameter match requirement and can be produced in a manufacturing environment. The substrates developed were grown using hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE), an alternative semiconductor growth process that can produce thick layers of semiconductor materials rapidly and economically. Metamorphic buffer layers (Figure 1), stacks of InxGa1-xAs with In concentration, x, increasing in a step-wise manner from zero to a value that results in a layer with desired lattice parameters, were grown using HVPE. We worked with industrial partners to gain insights into the required post-growth preparation of these substrates for subsequent device growth. A chemical-mechanical polishing plus wet etching process was developed to flatten the surfaces (Figure 2). Entirely new laser device designs were developed in this program that incorporate materials that are inaccessible on conventional Si, GaAs and InP substrates (Figure 3). These new laser designs eliminate key performance issues that exist in current state-of-the-art lasers operating within the mid-infrared spectral region. Such laser sources, called quantum cascade lasers, are needed for a variety of applications including remote sensing of chemicals and light detection and ranging (LIDAR). A key outcome of this project was the first realization of quantum cascade laser materials formed on our HVPE-grown substrates with designer specified lattice parameters.

In the first phase, the team will work to include the pnc-Si membranes in an existing device for portable pathogen detection. In this device the membranes will be used as a microfilter preventing aggregates from reaching detectors where they can cause false positive signals. In the second phase, the team will use the pnc-Si platform to miniaturize each step in the Integrated Nanotechnologies (INT) process to perform all reaction and detection steps on a single lab-on-a-chip device.

The broader impacts of this research are many. The project is expected to decrease the time-to-market for the INT device, addressing a long-standing need of the U.S. military for remote pathogen detection from small blood samples. The miniaturized device is expected to significantly reduce costs of this device and expand its penetration into nondefense markets. More broadly, the knowledge enhancement partners (KEP) will focus on the use of pnc-Si as a platform technology for pumping and separation in lab-on-a-chip devices. This is expected to have an impact on diverse industries, from biotechnology to the food industry, where lab-on-a-chip solutions are sought to reduce the cost of complex processes. Increased demand for products from the KEP's industrial partners is expected to spur economic growth in the Rochester area. The project will also involve students in the University of Rochester's new Technical Entrepreneurship and Management program who will develop business plans, conduct market research, and perform risk assessment. The project will employ underrepresented minorities through the University of Rochester's McNair program.

Partners at the inception of the project are Academic: the lead academic institution, the University of Rochester (Departments of Biomedical Engineering, Simon School of Business; Center for Entrepreneurship) and an academic partner, Rochester Institute of Technology  (Departments of Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering); and Small businesses: SiMPore Inc. (West Henrietta, NY), and  Integrated Nanotechnologies (Henrietta, NY). SiMPore is the exclusive manufacturer of pnc-Si, an ultrathin nanoporous membrane developed at UR. The devices developed will be based on INT's proprietary process for fully automated, portable pathogen detection. Both small companies are based in the greater Rochester area. RIT faculty will provide the KEP with expertise in miniaturization, electrokinetic flows and LOC devices.","Snyder JL, Getpreecharsawas J, Fang DZ, Gaborski TR, Striemer CC, Fauchet PM, Borkholder DA, McGrath JL.~High-performance, low-voltage electroosmotic pumps with molecularly thin silicon nanomembranes.~Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.~110~2013~18425~~10.1073~0~ ~0~ ~15/01/2016 21:14:03.826000000, Getpreecharsawas J, McGrath JL, Borkholder DA.~The electric field strength in orifice-like nanopores of ultrathin membranes.~Nanotechnology~26~2015~045704~~10.1088/0957~0~ ~0~ ~15/01/2016 21:14:03.823000000, Getpreecharsawas, J.

Despite the revolutionary promise of LOC technologies and growing demand in many industries, technical challenges in the miniaturization process are hampering the introduction of systems to the market place. The development of ?off-the-shelf? modules for key functions is one key to accelerating the adoption of LOC technologies.

This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project, entitled Partnership for Nanomembranes in Microscale Biodevices (PI: James McGrath; Lead Institution: University of Rochester), combined the resources of research laboratories at the University of Rochester (UR), the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), and the University of Ottawa (uO) with the world leader in silicon nanomembrane manufacturing SiMPore Inc. Teams focused on two lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications of nanomembranes: microfluidic pumping and filtering upstream of sensors.

Intellectual Merit: One team (UR, RIT, and SiMPore) demonstrated the unique capabilities of nanomembranes as microscale electroosmotic (EO) pumps. The material achieves high pumping rates (~ 10 ul/min) at low voltages (~ 1 V) enabling practical LOC pumps with low power requirements. The performance characteristics these pumps were shown to exceed all existing EO materials by orders-of-magnitude. This quality, and the ease in which the silicon format integrates with microfabricated channels, makes silicon nanomembranes uniquely suited to serve as microfluidic pumps. The team further established a predictive theoretical framework for the operation of nanomembrane EO pumps and developed successful strategies for improving operation against back-pressures. Products included three publications (one pending) and one patent application.

A second team (UR, uO, and SiMPore) focused on the application of nanomembranes are prefilters upstream of chip-based molecular sensors. The context for this application was DNA sequencing by single nanopores. Despite their promise for low cost genomics and pathogen detection, these technologies suffer from clogging by debris, which limits their lifetime of usefulness to several minutes. Our team developed strategies for placing highly porous nanomembranes within 100 nm of the single nanopore detectors and demonstrated the removal of contaminants and the extension of pore lifetimes to hours. Products include one pending publication.

Broader Impact: The development of silicon nanomembranes as a platform for separations and on-chip pumping in LOC devices is expected to impact diverse industries, from biotechnology to the food industry, where LOC solutions are sought to reduce the cost of complex processes. Indeed, there is commercial interest from large technology firms for both of the technologies developed under this PFI. SiMPore provided corporate shadowing opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate UR students. The program also enabled one UR post-doctoral fellow to participate in an immersive manufacturing-based internship at SiMPore. This experience allowed him to work seamlessly between organizations to align material fabrication strategies with application requirements. The materials and applications that emerged from the PFI can be directly credited with new growth at SiMPore after several years of stagnation.

Existing membranes are largely amorphous, glassy engineering thermoplastics that lack durability to organic contaminants in the gas streams.  The AIR innovation provides a means to fabricate membranes into hollow fiber platforms in solution, but also the membranes can be post-modified to develop both the needed durability as well as very good transport and mechanical properties.

The economical separation of air into O2 and N2 will enable inert N2 atmospheres to transport food globally and also will be applied to aircraft fuel tanks to minimize fires/explosions.

Intellectual Merit: The major goals of this AIR project have been to design and develop mechanically-robust, polymeric, gas separation membranes superior to the state-of-the-art for a variety of separations including air into oxygen and nitrogen, natural gas into the carbon dioxide impurity and methane, ethane, and higher hydrocarbon molecules. Finally, the separation of hydrogen from several components including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and the major natural gas component methane is a goal. 

 

A series of ductile polymers were designed and developed and it was discovered that, with key substituents on the aromatic rings, they could be crosslinked in the solid state after thin-film membranes had been fabricated. The crosslinked membranes have improved gas selectivities relative to current membranes that have been commercialized with little loss in permeability (flux). The extent of crosslinking was controlled through systematic variations in chemical structure and the conditions used in the ""post-membrane"" crosslinking process. We have worked closely with our third party investors to delineate relationships among structure, crosslinking conditions, and mechanical and transport properties. This concept of crosslinking the materials in the solid state, thin-film forms has now been demonstrated on many related polymers and copolymers. Our third party investor is exploring scalable economic manufacturing processes to utilize this achievement. The membranes will also necessarily require successful fabrication into asymmetric films and/or hollow fibers.

 

Broader Impacts: A provisional patent has been filed and we anticipate filing of the major U.S. patent application soon.

 

Polymeric membranes are well known to provide an energy-saving processing advantage for selective gas separations as compared to thermal distillation. Over the short term, in collaboration with our third party investor, we are exploring applications for these materials that include air separations to provide an inert nitrogen blanket for ""on-board"" aircraft engines, inert blanketing of large cargo compartments on transportation vehicles that carry flammable liquids, and for storage of foods in nitrogen-enriched atmosphere to lengthen their usable lifetime. The relatively recent technology to recover natural gas in the United States has opened up new types of gas and liquid separations that are critically needed and that would benefit the U.S. economy. Thus, new technologies related to processing of polymeric membranes could find use in oil and natural gas recovery and in processing of oils in refineries. This could significantly impact manufacturing processes in the U.S. chemical process industry.

 

By creating an interdisciplinary and industrially relevant program, we have been able to educate students in their fundamental polymer science field, and also in communication and collaboration skills. Chemistry students (Virginia Tech) and Chemical Engineering students (University of Texas) have been able to broaden their field of technical expertise through this collaboration. They have worked together as a team and also worked with our third party industrial investors. We believe that they will be able to carry these teaming and communication skills into future careers to benefit their companies and our economy.

Meeting these objectives will provide essential elements for a new paradigm, ""Highway for Life (HFL),"" an expression created by the Federal Highway Administration for the U.S. highway industry to capture the idea of advancing long lasting highways through innovation.  In this study, novel materials with demonstrated potential through past studies by the PI and four knowledge-enhancement partner (KEP) small businesses will be adopted.  Several modular elements will be developed consisting of Nickel-Titanium shape memory alloys, built-in elastomeric pads, engineered cementitious composites, and fiber-reinforced polymer structural members.  Large-scale structural models will be built and tested to evaluate performance under large deformations and to identify measures to improve and refine the connections.  The proposed research will be collaborative; involving an extensive exchange of ideas, information, and knowledge enabled by using regularly scheduled face-to-face or cyber-assisted meetings among the principal investigator and KEP business members.  The existing mechanisms at UNR Technology Transfer Office to protect intellectual property of the PIs and of the small business partners will be used to facilitate the project.    A project advisory board consisting of representatives from state and federal highway agencies will review the proposed designs and provide feedback to maximize the probability of acceptance of the connections in bridge construction.

The broader impacts of this research are new connection and column products with potential new markets in the U.S. and other countries, especially for the knowledge enhancement partner small businesses involved in this project.  The potential benefits to the travelling public are damage-free bridges that could remain functional even after disastrous events such as hurricanes and earthquakes.  Emergency response vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks will be able to continue to use the highway system and provide the much needed service without delays.  The impact on the general public is a more efficient use of materials and energy and less pollution because sustainable and recyclable bridges save tremendous amounts of energy.  The direct educational impact of the project is the knowledge that the UNR team, including graduate and undergraduate students, and the small business partners will gain by closely working with each other.  It is the intent of the project to engage undergraduate students in a research context which is both challenging and purposeful, so as to motivate them to pursue graduate education.  The tests of the novel materials will be webcast with the testing schedule widely announced to maximize the number of online visitors.  The findings from this study will be posted on the project website.  Furthermore, presentations to various technical groups will be made and the highlights of the project will be incorporated in two advanced structural engineering courses.  To maximize the probability of involvement of underrepresented groups, the PI will work with the UNR McNair program (a program aimed at increasing the number of doctoral students from underrepresented groups) and seek assistance in identifying potential talented students at the undergraduate and PhD level who could work on the project.  

Partners at the inception of the project are the Knowledge-Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of the University of Nevada Reno (the structural engineering program of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department and the Technology Transfer Office) and four small businesses: Dynamic Isolation Systems (DIS), Inc.

The objectives of the project were (1) to develop novel precast bridge column elements to resist strong earthquakes and yet remain functional and (2) to develop methods and connections to detach and reuse these elements to allow for their replacement or recycling into other bridges.  Specifically, the novel bridge elements that were developed utilize Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) superelastic shape memory alloys (SMA), rubber, engineered cementitious composites (ECC), and carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP).   Four small businesses, hereafter referred to as knowledge enhancement partners (KEPs), were involved in the project.  Each KEP was specialized in one of the novel materials.  The original goals of the project were achieved, with the summary description of the column elements presented subsequently.  In addition, the study was expanded because of the development of a new generation of Copper-Aluminum-Manganese (Cu-Al-Mn or CAM) superelastic SMA bars.  The PI collaborated with Japanese researchers to adopt them in this study.  The CAM SMA bars are less expensive than NiTi.

 

A column model that incorporated CAM bars and ECC was built.  Figure 1 shows the CAM bars before placing ECC.  The seismic performance was excellent and demonstrated the viability of CAM/ECC combination.  Also, three precast column elements with detachable connections were developed: CAM/ECC, NiTi/ECC, and NiTi/Rubber.  Figures 2 and 3, respectively, show an ECC element and a pair of rubber elements.  The elements are attached to a footing through SMA bars.  Subsequently the upper part of the column, which is made of concrete-filled CFRP shells, is lowered and fastened onto the element (Figure 4).

 

The CAM/ECC, NiTi/ECC, and NiTi/Rubber columns were assembled and tested on a shake table under simulated strong earthquakes.  All the segments were free from damage except for minor cracks in the ECC elements.  The satisfactory seismic performance of the column and the successful assembly, disassembly, reassembly, and the second disassembly proved that the concepts are feasible and appropriate for implementation in a bridge system.

 

Subsequently a quarter-scale, two-span bridge model was designed and constructed.  The main features of this bridge model were: (1) the bridge was designed for disassembly and reassembly, (2) steel pipe-pin connections were used to connect the top of the columns to the superstructure to simplify construction, (3) the support consisted of three, two-column piers, and (4) the column pairs in each pier used one of the novel plastic hinge elements.  Figure 5 shows the overview of the two-span bridge model.  The model was subjected to several simulated earthquakes ranging from small to strong.  Subsequently the bridge was disassembled, the cracks in the ECC elements were repaired, and the bridge was reassembled and retested to even stronger earthquakes.

 

The important findings from the bridge tests that a bridge utilizing the novel elements could remain functional even after strong earthquakes.  Figure 6 shows the condition of one of the ECC elements after the original bridge test.

 

The broader impact of the project was multifaceted.  Close interaction with the KEPs revealed the great potential and benefit that can be realized by KEPs and universities due to synergy from multidisciplinary research.  Specifically, the collaboration with Fibermatrix led to a patent of the column plastic hinge elements (US Patent No.: US 9,677,274 B2).  This KEP is in negotiation with the university for licensing agreement.  Furthermore, this KEP developed the next generation of plastic hinge elements and established a new company to market different versions of these elements.  The company has been approaching several agencies with construction projects in high seismic zones.

 

Another important broader aspect of the project was the training of a doctoral student and eight REUs, five of whom have chosen to pursue graduate degrees. 

 

Numerous publications and presentations about the project (listed at: https://wolfweb.unr.edu/homepage/saiidi/NSF-PFI/index.html) have helped spread the concept of innovative bridges nationally and internationally.

 

Summary of the Outcomes

 

One of the key tasks undertaken initially was to identify potential detachable connections that could be adopted in bridge engineering.  Available connections in other industries including those used in furniture assembly were studied.  With respect to resilient column elements, past research revealed several possible options for investigation.  These included SMA?s, ECC, and CFRP.  Upon further investigation, it was determined that a new generation of SMA?s utilizing an alloy of Copper, Aluminum, and Manganese (CAM) could also be feasible with sufficient development.  Upon successful development of detachable bridge column a patent application was filed and a patent was received.  One of the KEPs has expanded the column elements, has formed a company to market and engineer the product, and is in licensing negation with the University of Nevada, Reno.  Another important outcome of this study was training of one PhD and eight undergraduate student researchers.  Numerous articles have been published as a result of this research and nearly 30 presentations have been given.

Despite the magnitude of this problem, 68% of high school principals reported lacking formal training on how to assist teen dating violence victims. The proposed technology offers an economically viable dating violence prevention strategy for high schools. The existing mobile apps are not designed for high school students to assist themselves (or a friend) who is a victim of teen dating violence and do not have a have a simple mechanism enabling high school administrators to coordinate and customize the prevention and response messaging their students are accessing. If successful, the proposed technology will fill a gap not addressed by currently available solutions, which are not designed to help the students enrolled in the 35,163 US high schools discretely extricate themselves from situations with the potential to become dangerous. 

The proposed project will consist of three elements that, combined, represent a highly innovative technology solution to a prevalent public health problem. First is the use of existing smartphone capabilities in new ways (e.g., enabling users to appear to receive urgent texts or phone calls, which are, in reality, simulated, to provide a socially sensitive reason for a student to leave a risky situation). Second is the application of extensive evidence-based research to both prevention and response technology features within the app. Third is a simple-to-use dashboard, through which high school administrators can easily customize data in the back-end database, to make it specific to their students and institution, and monitor its use among their students.
The specific feature requirements needed for this interactive mobile platform will be informed by institutional review board (IRB)-reviewed interviews, focus groups and online surveys with students, parents/guardians and school administrators. The proposed hybrid smartphone app will run on Apple iOS and Android operating systems, using Google's Firebase SDK for analytics and accessing data from a back-end SQL database. The app platform will include a simple-to-use dashboard interface to the database, enabling schools to easily customize content to adapt to school and state policies and to monitor anonymous statistics about app use within their institution.

This process requires less electricity to provide oxygen for treatment ordinarily used in treating wastewater, as well as using atmospheric carbon dioxide.  This could be retrofitted in the infrastructure in developed countries and could be included in new wastewater treatment facilities. For regions where wastewater treatment is absent or inadequate, sanitation via the OPG technology improves public health and the environment at a lower cost than conventional technology. This process has been demonstrated successfully at small scales, but scale-up and implementation requires the scientific and technical advancements of the proposed PFI-RP project. This project will include significant advanced training of future engineers and scientists, including underrepresented groups.  Outreach to students, increased graduate study opportunities for women and minorities, and technology transfer are also benefits to society at large. 

The proposed project is critical for developing commercial implementation of the new self-aerating OPG process for sustainable wastewater treatment. The OPG process has the potential to solve wastewater treatment challenges in both developing and developed countries. Despite prior advancements in photogranulation knowledge, and success of bench-scale OPG systems, process scale-up in a natural light setting recently failed after initial success. The PIs hypothesize that this outcome was due to photoinhibition of photogranulation, which has not been studied in previous OPG research. Objectives of the proposed research are to a) investigate the photoinhibition phenomenon by studying the photochemical capacity and the photosynthesis range of the OPG process, and b) to develop a fluid mixing and irradiance-based method to limit photoinhibition of OPG reactors. Integrating these critical new knowledge sets is expected to yield an innovative irradiance-based mixing scheme to control photoinhibition and support adequate oxygenic photosynthesis. Research methods include operation of batch and continuous flow reactors under different irradiance and mixing conditions and modeling of reactor hydrodynamics and OPG transport. These activities will significantly improve knowledge of photogranulation and enhance the translation of a new wastewater treatment technology to a commercial scale.

PEGs are neutral, stable, flexible, non-toxic and dissolve easily, and thus they are used in many applications, including pharmaceutical products and other biomedical applications.  However, it is difficult to make PEGs with enough purity and consistency for use in more advanced pharmaceutical applications, and for other uses, the right PEG simply cannot be made.  This PFI project will develop and commercialize novel ways to synthesize PEGs.  The new affordable and highly pure PEGs will generate higher quality and lower prices for drugs using them; similarly, many biomedical and related research projects requiring PEGs will be more affordable and will generate more consistent results.

The proposed project will advance the knowledge needed for the synthesis of highly pure PEGs with affordable prices. Currently, pure PEGs shorter than those with 64 ethylene glycol monomer units can be synthesized, but the methods require multiple expensive reaction workups and chromatography, and the products have limited purity. In addition, pure PEGs longer than 64 ethylene glycol monomer units with acceptable purity cannot be synthesized using any known methods. The technical hurdles that cause these problems of PEG synthesis include the difficulty to separate PEG products and impurities, slow reaction rates, and depolymerization side reactions. The research objective of this project is to gain the knowledge needed to overcome these technical hurdles. The approaches include using solid phase synthesis instead of traditional solution phase synthesis, innovative stepwise synthesis monomers, and automated synthesis using a peptide synthesizer. Using these approaches, the products will be easily isolated without tedious workup and purified without expensive chromatography, the reaction rates will be increased, the depolymerization side reaction will be suppressed, and the process will require minimal labor. It is expected that once detailed knowledge about using these approaches are obtained, pure PEGs with unprecedented high quality and low costs will be conveniently produced.

More than 22 million Americans are affected by sleep apnea. The current home sleep test systems tend to underestimate sleep apnea severity with a high false negative rate. Eighty percent of patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea are never diagnosed. Because sleep apnea is a serious medical condition and a major public health issue, we urgently need a new sleep apnea screening framework. The proposed framework is one of the first deep learning based sleep apnea screening framework using wearable and IoT sensors. It has commercial potential: it can potentially improve screening accuracy by 40 percent with low cost compared with existing sleep apnea screening devices.  The proposed project also includes a broader participant plan. In order to further enhance inclusion of students from all backgrounds, the PFI-TT project will leverage existing programs with schools and programs at the University of Arizona. Additional workshops and teleconferences will be provided for underrepresented groups, particularly women, Hispanic, African Americans and Native Americans, to mentor and coach students with interests in entrepreneurship. The success of our program can be adapted at other institutions nationally and globally through the Desire2Learn program at the University of Arizona. 

The proposed project provides a new sleep apnea screening framework that can addresses the need of low cost together with the need of high precision sleep apnea screening. The intellectual merit of the new sleep apnea screening framework includes a new integrated sleep monitoring wearable sensor, two deep neural network algorithms, and a smart phone based app to collect sleep data and provide screening results. The sleep monitoring wearable sensor incorporates multiple sensors on a single platform with non-volatile memory and low energy Bluetooth. The new deep learning network models classifies the severity of sleep apnea using seven levels based on the Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). The new models include bidirectional long-short term memory layers and fully connected layers to explore and extract sensory data together with static features such as users' demographic information, existing chronic diseases, and general wellbeing. A post data processing procedure is developed to translate the probability of sleep apnea at the output of deep neural networks to sleep apnea severity using the maximum probability.

In agriculture, the sensor system can be applied to soil and water quality monitoring.  In health, the sensor system can be applied to monitoring of biotherapeutics in manufacturing and health status of closed wounds. Advantages of this sensor platform are its passive unit architecture (no on-board power), potential low cost, and ability to measure in closed systems. This PFI will enable the founding of one or more startups in these market spaces, which will in turn lead to increased employment opportunities and economic development.  Moreover, this project will train two graduate students and 10 undergraduates with technical skills in materials, electronics, and characterizations tools in an interdisciplinary environment.  They will also receive valuable innovation skills in product design, reliability, robustness, and commercialization due to the project scope and inclusion of active industrial partners. These students with special attention to those underrepresented in STEM fields.


The proposed project addresses attributes needed to commercialize resonant sensors that are common to all market sectors, namely 1) the methods and materials to enable scalable fabrication of the sensors, 2) the materials and methods to encapsulate (package) the sensors, and 3) custom reader hardware and analysis software to lower the cost and improve read range of the resonant sensor.  For the first, screen-printable inks that are optimized for inductive resonance will be developed and large-batch (>1000 unit) methods of printing and roll to roll fabrication will be demonstrated. For the second, elastomeric encapsulants and flexible, polymeric substrates will be evaluated for their performance with resonant sensors.  In the third, a low-cost (<$100) custom reader will be developed to supplant the more expensive portable vector network analyzers currently in use and to improve sensor read range.  In each of these specific areas, performance will be assessed in actual end-use scenarios through existing research programs we have on resonant sensors for consumer, agriculture, and health applications.  The anticipated technical results include optimal material formulations for flexible resonant sensor fabrication and packaging, hardware specifications for low-cost readers, and methods to produce the sensors and readers at large scale, thus enabling commercialization entry.

High-speed optical fiber links are responsible for transmitting enormous amount of data and are the backbone of internet. However, the existing optical networks, that transmit our multimedia emails, music and video streaming, cannot meet the demands for more bandwidth and reduced energy consumption. One of the limiting factors is a modulator device that converts information from electrical to optical domain. This program will address this, and develop a fully integrated and packaged modulator prototype that will meet the societal needs for better connectivity. The target markets for the technology will be providers of computer and telecommunication network equipment, data- and computing-center owners, and network-service providers. In addition, the research community, specialty measurement equipment manufacturers, and defense contractors, will benefit from the developed technology. The program has a theoretical and experimental component and addresses both fundamental and engineering aspects of photonics, optoelectronics, and communication systems.

The proposed project will address the efficiency with which light can be brought onto a lithium-niobate modulator chip. As recently demonstrated, thin film lithium-niobate photonic platform allows for realization of high speed modulators (> 100 GHz) that operate at low voltages (~ 1 V) and feature very low loss, and that therefore can meet the demands for better connectivity and higher data rates. However, due to their sub-micron scale, these modulators cannot be efficiently connectorized to optical fibers, which results in large optical losses (> 7 dB/ facet). This significantly affects the usefulness of these devices, and limits them to laboratory demonstrations, only. To address this, the team will develop techniques to reduce coupling efficiency to ~ 1dB/ facet, and use this to develop fully packaged and pig-tailed modulator prototype. These will then be benchmarked against the state of the art technologies, as well as for customer development activities.

However, they are also responsible for enormous amount of wasted energy. For example, data centers are to blame for 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, about the same amount as airline industry (The Guardian, Sep 25, 2015), and big portion of this energy is spent on transmitting information. Efficiency of optical interconnects is limited by the performance of electro-optic (E/O) modulators used to convert digital information from electrical domain, used for computation, to optical domain, used for communication. PI?s team has recently demonstrated highly-integrated, ultra-low loss, lithium niobate (LN) nanophotonic platform and used it to demonstrate excellent E/O modulators.

Within the scope of PFI-TT program, we adressed one of important challenges that this platform is facing - efficient coupling between fiber optic network and chip-scale E/O systems. This was accomplished by designing, fabricating and characterizing different types of fiber-optic couplers that can be used to match the size of optical modes propagating inside optical fiber and on-chip waveguides. While this approach is commonly used in other mature integrated photonic platforms (e.g. silicon photonics) adapting it to LN platform was challenging. We have overcome this challenge by developing new designs and optimizaing the fabricaiton process. Specifically,  we experimentally demonstrated a low-loss mode size converter for coupling between a standard lensed fiber and sub-micrometer LN rib waveguides. The coupler consists of two inverse tapers that convert the small optical mode of a rib waveguide into a symmetrically guided mode of a LN nanowire, featuring a larger mode area matched to that of a tapered optical fiber. The measured fiber-to-chip coupling loss is lower than 1.7 dB/facet with high fabrication tolerance and repeatability. Our approach results in nearly  10 smaller coupling loss, and thus  opens the door for practical integrated LN photonic circuits efficiently interfaced with optical fibers.This technology has been transfered to an industrial partner.

Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the US with nearly 80% of all stroke survivors experiencing some form of upper limb paralysis. Prior work by the PI has led to the development of a sophisticated exoskeleton for upper limb rehabilitation, called HARMONY. This PFI:AIR-TT award will support a novel controls framework for HARMONY that holds potential to improve the rehabilitation outcomes of not only stroke patients but also those with upper extremity neurological and musculoskeletal impairments. Currently there is only one robot commercially available for delivering physical therapy to the upper body. HARMONY offers improvements over this system through the following features: i) HARMONY can power entire shoulder movement; ii) HARMONY is bimanual, so it can simultaneously deliver therapy to both arms, which opens up possibilities for novel bimanual therapy; and iii) HARMONY allows for customization of the robot's force is at each joint which is critical for physical therapy. 

This project will develop a new controls framework that ensures patient involvement and provides the appropriate amount of assistance so that subjects can complete the desired task. To achieve this objective, the following two specific aims will be pursued: Aim 1) Develop and test novel controls framework for multi-DOF, bimanual human-exoskeleton interactions and Aim 2) Demonstrate the efficacy of the adaptive controllers through experiments with healthy subjects. The team, involving two participants with business and commercialization expertise, will advance understanding of the business aspects, including IP, regulatory issues and market need, and will generate a commercialization plan.

With mentoring from personnel with business and commercialization experience and the focus on developing a commercialization plan, this project will create a unique opportunity for educating the academic participants in the process of translating basic research into deployed technology. Successful completion of this project will aid in the development of the next generation of innovators and business leaders.","Kim, B. S., and Deshpande, A.

Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the US with nearly 80% of all stroke survivors experiencing some form of upper limb paralysis. A significant number of stroke survivors demonstrate shoulder dysfunction and pain, leading to severe disability. Conventional therapies have only been moderately successful, and these treatments are labor-intensive, time-consuming and costly. We have developed one of the most sophisticated exoskeletons for upper limb rehabilitation, called Harmony. The exoskeleton wraps around the subject?s both shoulders, arms and wrists, and has the ability to move the user?s shoulder complex through its natural mobility. Prior NSF funding supported the development of novel design ideas and building and testing of prototypes. And this project resulted in further technological developments, testing with healthy and stroke subjects, and progress on the commercialization front. 
 

The intellectual merits of this project are: (i) a controls framework for the upper-body exoskeleton Harmony for delivering physical therapy effectively; (ii) confirmation of efficacy of Harmony in assisting with the critical upper-body movements through experiments with healthy subjects and stroke patients; and (iii) setting up of a new start-up and significant progress toward bringing Harmony out of the research lab and in the hospital setting to treat patients. In addition, the proposed project created a unique interdisciplinary environment enabling education, training, and co-advising of graduate students, undergraduate research, and significant and targeted outreach activities to underrepresented groups in science and engineering. These aspects address the broader impacts of the research effort.

Outcomes 

Research: The team completed the following research activities during the life of the award, all contributing to the goal of upper-body exoskeleton for stroke recovery. 

We have developed a novel assist-as-needed controller for powering arm and shoulder movements  

We have developed and tested a controls framework for multi-DOF, bimanual human-exoskeleton interactions.
To confirm the benefits of the assistance, a human subject study has been conducted.


We developed algorithms for effort estimation in robot-aided training with a neural network
We explored the capabilities of Harmony for upper-body stroke therapy with experiments with stroke subjects


 

Commercialization: 

The start-up, Harmonic Bionics took significant steps toward commercialization of Harmony Exoskeleton. We hired a new CEO who comes with two decades of experience in surgical robotics and we also hired two full-time engineers. A license agreement was set up between UT Austin and Harmonic Bionics. A new version of Harmony, which incorporates feedback from the customers during the PFI-AIR-TT grant period, is now ready for further testing. We have also established collaborations with 11 leading hospitals around the country who are interested in experimenting with Harmony and one day purchasing it. 

Outreach: The ReNeu lab conducted a number of outreach activities aimed at broadening participation in STEM fields. Activities included laboratory tours for K-12 and teachers, lectures, and graduate student mentoring of high school students. 

Education and Mentoring: The PI completed curricular development in two courses at UT: Robot Mechanism Design course and Brain, Body and Robotics. One post-doc, two graduate students and four undergraduate students were engaged with the research effort throughout the life of the grant.

Synergistic activities: The PI Deshpande collaborated with faculty members at UT to expand the two newly formed cross-campus research groups: Clinically Assisted Rehabilitation Engineering (CARE) and Robotics Consortium. PI also participated in a number of mentoring activities related to technology commercialization on UT campus.

Bridges deliver such a fundamental service to society that they are often taken for granted. Typically, bridges only stir the public's interest when they must unexpectedly be replaced at great cost, or, worse, fail. The Living Bridge project will create a self-diagnosing, self-reporting ""smart bridge"" powered by a local renewable energy source, tidal energy, by transforming the landmark Memorial Bridge--a vertical lift bridge over the tidal Piscataqua River, with pedestrian access connecting Portsmouth, New Hampshire to Kittery, Maine--into a living laboratory for researchers, engineers, scientists, and the community at large. The Living Bridge will engage innovators in sensor and renewable energy technology by creating an incubator platform on a working bridge, from which researchers can field test and evaluate the impact and effectiveness of emerging technologies. The Living Bridge will also serve as a community platform to educate citizens about innovations occurring at the site and in the region, and about how incorporating renewable energy into bridge design can lead to a sustainable transportation infrastructure with impact far beyond the region. 

Sustainable, smart bridges are key elements in developing a successful infrastructure system. To advance the state of smart service systems and clean energy conversion, this project team will design and deploy a structural and environmental monitoring system that provides information for bridge condition assessment, traffic management, and environmental stewardship; advances renewable energy technology application; and excites the general public about bridge innovations. This PFI:BIC project is enabled through partnerships between academic researchers with expertise in structural, mechanical and ocean engineering, sensing technology and social science; small businesses with expertise in instrumentation, data acquisition, tidal energy conversion; and state agencies with bridge design expertise. The Living Bridge technical areas are structural health monitoring, tidal energy conversion with fluid-structure interaction measurements, estuarine environmental monitoring, and outreach communication. Sensors will be used to calibrate a three-dimensional analytical structural finite element model of the bridge. The predicted structural response from this model will assess the measured structural response of the bridge as acceptable or not. Instruments installed on the turbine deployment platform will measure the spatio-temporal structure of the turbulent inflow and modified wake flow downstream of the turbine. Resulting data will include turbine performance and loads for use in fluid-structure interaction models. Deployed environmental sensors will measure estuarine water quality; wildlife deterrent sensors will deter fish from the turbine. Hydrophones and video cameras will be used before and during turbine deployment to monitor environmental changes due to turbine presence. Outreach efforts will make bridge data, history, and information about new systems accessible and understandable to the public and K-12 educators, facilitated by an information kiosk installed at the bridge. Public awareness will be assessed with survey methods used in the N.H. Granite State Poll.

The centerpiece of the project is a Smart-city Cloud-based Open Platform and Ecosystem (SCOPE), which creates a multisided marketplace for smart-city services based on the Open Cloud eXchange model, in which stakeholders compete and cooperate within the same infrastructure. By harnessing breakthroughs in cyber-physical, mobile, and cloud computing technologies, and by building upon novel data acquisition and mining capabilities to be developed by the investigators and their industrial partners, SCOPE-enabled smart-city services will address challenges faced by twenty-first century cities: connecting people with resources, guiding changes in collective behavior, and supporting innovative transportation, healthcare, energy distribution, and emergency response solutions, as well as business, commerce, and social applications. SCOPE's broader impacts include providing a template for widespread experimentation with and adoption of smart-city services by other cities in Massachusetts and beyond; accelerating technological innovation, commercialization, and business development; breaking technological and institutional silos; facilitating institutional transformations and deep citizen engagement; and development of curricular content and projects that leverage smart-city big-data platforms. 

The implementation of SCOPE entails the design and prototyping of new techniques and novel application programming interfaces, adding capabilities that are currently not available in public cloud offerings, including (a) support for predictable operation of cyber-physical systems in support of sense-and-respond real-time applications; (b) management of data quality and provenance attributes in support of applications that fuse potentially noisy data from multiple trusted and untrusted sources; and (c) incorporation of security-enhancing services in support of privacy-preserving analytics. In addition to the design and prototyping of SCOPE, the investigators and their collaborators will work with partners to develop specific SCOPE-enabled smart-city services, including (d) transportation and mobility services to reduce traffic congestion, save time and wasted fuel, and reduce pollution; (e) energy and environmental services that monitor/estimate greenhouse gas emissions for congestion management and coordination of smart-grid energy demand-response solutions; (f) public safety and security services for big-data-driven coordinated scheduling of public works and municipal repairs; and (g) tools for management of city assets through mining of large data sets and crowd-sourced coordination of asset use. Additionally, the investigators will investigate and evaluate various (h) social, institutional and behavioral mechanisms to facilitate adoption of new services, such as incentive programs and community report cards to promote transparency and sustainability. 

Through the Hariri Institute for Computing at Boston University, SCOPE will be led by investigators from multiple disciplines including Computer Science, Systems Engineering, Earth and Environment, and Urban Planning. Once developed, SCOPE services will be offered through the Massachusetts Open Cloud, a new public cloud designed and implemented through the Green High-Performance Computing Center (Holyoke, MA) and supported by the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative (Westborough, MA).

The centerpiece of the project is a Smart-city Cloud-based Open Platform and Ecosystem (SCOPE) &ndash; a software platform for new data mechanics and analytics capabilities that support a multisided marketplace for smart-city services based on the Open Cloud eXchange model, in which potentially competing stakeholders cooperate within the same infrastructure to deliver applications and services for the public good.

The implementation of SCOPE entailed the open-source design and prototyping of new techniques and novel application programming interfaces that added capabilities that were not available in public cloud offerings. This included support for sense-and-respond real-time applications, management of data quality and provenance attributes for applications that fuse potentially noisy data from multiple trusted and untrusted sources, and the incorporation of security-enhancing services in support of privacy-preserving analytics using data from multiple stakeholders.

The project adopted a unique software development strategy by integrating the development of SCOPE into the CS curriculum through a new ""Data Mechanics"" course. Supervised by the PIs and by professional software engineers in the Software and Application Innovation Lab (SAIL), elements of SCOPE were developed incrementally by over 200 students who pursued over 80 projects in eight offerings of the course. Each of these projects added new components to the SCOPE platform and demonstrated its use to enable novel smart-city services and urban analytics. 

In addition to the design and prototyping of SCOPE, the investigators and their collaborators worked with partners to develop specific SCOPE-enabled smart-city services. These included (a) mobility services to reduce traffic congestion, save time and fuel, and reduce pollution, (b) energy and environmental services that monitor/estimate greenhouse gas emissions for congestion management and coordination, (c) data-driven public safety applications that leverage data assets siloed across public agencies and private companies, and (d) privacy-preserving analytics services that leverage confidential data for public good. Two notable examples of successful and on-going partnerships with the City of Boston that produced outcomes of significant societal broader impacts as a result of the use of SCOPE capabilities are summarized below.

Co-PI Hutyra and collaborators worked with the Boston Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) to develop a roadway-scale model of vehicle emissions of both CO2 and five additional air pollutant species for the greater Boston metropolitan area. This model integrated EPA and Boston MPO vehicle and travel models, road sensor measurements of traffic, and a very high resolution dataset of actual vehicle travel speeds at 5-minute intervals derived from mobile phone and vehicle GPS data provided by INRIX. The final high-resolution inventory quantifies pollutant emissions at hourly timescales for every road in eastern Massachusetts. This inventory identified spatial and temporal ""emissions hot spots"" where combinations of vehicle activity and traffic congestion produce large amounts of pollutant emissions and also key traffic corridors where traffic congestion is responsible for localized pollution 75% above normal traffic levels. These findings were instrumental in synthesizing the ""Go Boston 2030: Imagining our Transportation Future"" report.

PI Bestavros and collaborators joined forces with the Boston Women?s Workforce Council (BWWC) to use SCOPE?s secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) capabilities to support the ""Boston Women?s Compact"" (BWC) &ndash; a voluntary agreement in which over 200 Boston-based businesses pledged to take concrete, measurable steps to eliminate the wage gap and to report their progress anonymously every two years. The key technical challenge for the compact that the SCOPE MPC capabilities helped circumvent was to enable the calculation of pay gap analytics (at the aggregate level) without revealing the presence or extent of such gaps in any of the participating businesses. This collaboration has resulted in three iterations of privacy-preserving gender-pay-equity analytics based on real payroll information from over 120K employees &ndash; the first of its kind in the US. The aggregate data (and analysis thereof) from the 2016 and from the 2017 deployments were published by the Boston Women?s Workforce Council in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Key findings from these studies were unveiled at press conferences organized by the City of Boston Mayor (Marty Walsh) and commanded significant national media attention. The SCOPE platform component that enabled privacy-preserving gender pay-equity analytics for the City of Boston has also been used in other public-good applications by the Massachusetts Bankers Association and by the City of Boston Chamber of Commerce. SCOPE?s MPC capabilities were referenced in bi-partisan US congressional bills (including H.R. 4174 and H.R. 4479) as enablers for a host of similar social-good applications where legitimate confidentiality concerns often stand in the way of mining aggregate data assets for public good.

If successful, this project is expected to radically change job hazard safety management for the $1.2 trillion U.S. construction industry in which approximately three to four workers die every working day. The proposed technology is expected to help owners, contractors, and construction managers to make better and safer decisions for dynamic construction work. In addition, this study can provide valuable data regarding the safety condition of workers, which benefits the individuals' health as well as safety management and society in general. The collected data will preserve safety knowledge within the company and help knowledge transfer from experienced professionals to new generations. The research project will also provide an opportunity to engage underrepresented students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds to learn about the challenging engineering problems in the construction industry and equip them with scientific knowledge to address those problems.

The proposed project aims to provide a holistic solution for intelligently monitoring individual workers' exposure to hazards and unsafe postures. For a system to be feasible as well as practically acceptable in construction which has dynamic and transient work environmental characteristics, the system needs to satisfy many factors: cost, ease of use, scalability, real-time ability, network connectivity, form factor, system deployment, accuracy, reliability, and privacy. While satisfying the factors, a Building Information Model (BIM)-driven Internet of Things (IoT) application will be used as a central platform for user interface and sensor tracking algorithms in the proposed PFI project. In particular, when the construction work schedules are set and incorporated into BIM, daily and weekly work activity information is extracted. These data can serve to automatically or semi-automatically identify potential hazards in advance based on construction progress. In addition to the location-based safety risks, postural working conditions of the workers are monitored through a motion recognition function using machine learning algorithms. The monitored and quantified information can provide valuable data regarding the safety condition of workers, empower our knowledge about each worker's health and safety-related behavior in a quantitative manner, and thus deliver an objective, comprehensive safety reinforcing system to a job site.

The proposed project provides a novel permissioned blockchain-based IoT infrastructure that is expected to be more secure and reliable than existing cloud-based solutions and also more modular and scalable in terms of both servers and IoT devices supported. The intellectual merit of the new infrastructure includes a new permissioned blockchain protocol, a new IoT architecture supporting IoT devices at scale, and an easy-to-use mobile app. The permissioned blockchain protocol provides 1) modular trade-offs for not only the underlying consensus protocols but also confidentiality and access control, and 2) server scalability by designing new reliable distributed systems and cryptographic primitives. The new IoT architecture uses permissioned blockchain as servers and industry edge nodes as immediate brokers to support miscellaneous IoT devices at large scale. It uses fault-tolerant and cryptographic technologies to ensure edge nodes function correctly, without introducing additional points of failure or vulnerabilities. The app supports major IoT functions (sensors, mobile routers, cameras, IoT switches), provides real-time alerts, IoT data analysis, and anomaly detection for IoT devices.

The poultry industry is highly competitive, and poultry has become one of the most efficient animal proteins to produce.  Billions of birds are grown in the United States each year and most are raised by independent farmers in cooperation with larger producers.  This PFI project is aimed at providing non-invasive, continuous monitoring of chicken flocks to alert the farmer to problems in a timely manner and aid the farmer in assessing the welfare and needs of his flocks.  The end result is expected to be healthier and better-cared for birds as well as improved farm productivity.

The proposed project makes it possible to use machine learning to monitor audio environments, in this case chicken farms, without needing extensive labeled training data.  The approaches typically used for audio machine learning require extensive labeled training sample sets and tuning.  However, humans can become familiar with the sounds in a particular situation, and notice when something occurs that does not belong, without significant training.  By using algorithms that learn the structure of sounds in an environment and learn the typical variation of those sounds, the methods used in the proposed project can act similarly to a human listener to notice significant changes (anomalies) in a soundscape on a farm.  The anomalies are characterized by severity and can be brought to the attention of a farmer or researchers who can choose to label or ignore the new sound.  Labeled sounds can then be used to automatically label future anomalies.  This project will deploy listening devices into multiple commercial chicken farms, collect continuous audio recordings and metadata, and use the collected data to improve the performance and usefulness of the systems for monitoring the chickens' welfare and their environment.  This listening method is non-invasive and causes no stress to the animals.

The materials developed here will improve the performance of devices across several markets and the process will be compatible with high-throughput manufacturing.  This will impact several types of devices with high market potential, enabling displays with lower power consumption and higher brightness, as well as solar cells with extended useful lifetimes.  The devices can be thin and semi-transparent for solar windows or for see-through displays, and they can be encapsulated in glass to provide an impermeable hermetic barrier. This PFI will enable the founding of one or more startups in these market spaces, which will in turn lead to employment opportunities and economic development. Moreover, this project will train one postdoctoral researcher and 9 undergraduates with skills in instrumentation development, material deposition, and characterization methods. Students will also receive valuable skills in innovation, entrepreneurship and commercialization through participation in an innovative team-based course. Students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields will be particularly recruited to participate in the project.

The proposed project addresses the need for large grain-size crystalline semiconductor thin films with greatly improved properties for a wide range of devices.  For field-effect transistors, grain size larger than the transistor channel length leads to improved charge carrier mobility, which enables brighter displays.  In photovoltaic cells based on hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite materials, large grain size suppresses degradation mechanisms occurring at grain boundaries.  Solution-based thin films deposition can deliver these advantages, while also being readily compatible with high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing processes.  This project takes recent advances in research on deposition from liquid solutions to the next level by scaling up the writing heads and adopting roll-to-roll methods. The anticipated technical results include the construction of a deposition unit that will be used to demonstrate an array of Organic Field Effect Transistors, which will be integrated with Organic Light Emitting Diode pixels to form a simple display.  A second unit will be used to demonstrate perovskite photovoltaic cells with improved properties.  Long lifetime and improved environmental stability will be achieved through control of thin film properties such as grain size, through the use of thin flexible glass substrates with high hermeticity, and through glass-to-glass bonding by a laser sealing method.

This paves the way for a better understanding of the manufacturing process, thereby enabling efficient and sustainable production. The commercial availability of low-cost, real-time and high-speed wireless technology will enable a wide range of new applications benefiting society in many ways. Just as ordinary WiFi technology has transformed the landscape of wireless communication for business use, our new real-time version of WiFi will enable industrial applications such as advanced process control and manufacturing, assistive tele-robotics, high-bandwidth health monitoring, autonomous vehicle safety assurance, and others.  This PFI-TT project will also enable a comprehensive training program for future leaders in innovation and entrepreneurship to develop their ability to conduct innovative research projects as well as effective communication and entrepreneurial skills, and thus have significant educational and societal impacts.

The proposed project will address the drawbacks of existing wireless communication networks, which are not equipped with providing either deterministic or high-speed real-time communication for large-scale industrial sensing and control systems.  The proposed RT-WiFi protocol will 1) support up to 6kHz sampling rates that is sufficient for most industrial wireless applications, which require highly predictable performance; 2) offer the capability for extending to multi-cluster settings to cover large factories; 3) provide extremely high reliability through dynamic and distributed packet scheduling for autonomous adaptation to the noisy factory environment; and 4) tolerate any single point hardware/software failures with robust gateway design. It is envisioned that upon the successful completion of this project, a full-blown RT-WiFi communication system can be developed to support a large number of reliable and dynamic real-time flows in large-scale high-speed industrial wireless control networks. These unique features will make RT-WiFi an ideal communication infrastructure to support not only advanced process control systems, but also other fast growing industry segments in robotics, autonomous vehicles and high-speed mechanical processes.

Low-pressure plasmas are widely used for the manufacturing of semiconductor integrated circuits, displays, solar panels, thin film batteries, and coatings. The annual market of these industry segments exceeds $600 billion. Computer simulation is an essential approach to understanding the complex plasma characteristics and developing efficient plasma processing technologies. Unfortunately, current commercial plasma simulation software requires huge computational resources; it takes months to model the plasmas in practical scales. The lack of a practical tool for modeling low-pressure plasmas has resulted in improperly designed sources, leading to the inefficient processes used today. This PFI-TT project aims to develop new computation schemes for efficiently modeling certain plasmas at low pressures. These tools will allow the users to simulate plasmas of practical scales, using even desktop computers that generate feedback in 24 hours. This project will also train and broaden the participation of graduate and undergraduate students, and prepare them as future leaders in technology innovation and entrepreneurship.   

The proposed project combines an implicit algorithm of the motions of charged particles with an energy conservation scheme to eliminate the spatial and temporal constraints in the state-of-the-art explicit particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision algorithms. The key advantage of the implicit algorithm is that the high frequency oscillations of plasmas are damped in the time domain. The energy conservation scheme ensures that the total energy of the plasma is conserved and the self-heating due to a large grid spacing (i.e. significantly greater than the plasma Debye length) is eliminated. The new computation scheme is over 30 times faster than the state-of-the-art explicit particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision algorithms. The developed modeling tools also have the potential to address situations where a complete kinetic analysis is not yet available due to the high plasma density, such as high-power impulse magnetron sputtering and the plasma instabilities in magnetized discharges.

Another potential use is retrofitting shading fabrics, such as those used on carports; this would not only effectively block sunlight and thus minimize car heating, but could also supply additional power for lighting and/or charging electric vehicles. This could also be used for forward operating bases or other remote military operations if integrated with tents, reducing diesel fuel demand and the associated risk to the supplying troops, as well as associated costs. 

The proposed project will develop a technology to enable large-scale manufacturing of high-performance fully-flexible perovskite solar cells. In spite of rapid progress in efficiency and low-cost potential from solution processing capability, perovskite solar cells still have to overcome a few obstacles before becoming economically competitive in the photovoltaic market. In particular, life span and the lengthy annealing time limit the capability for high-speed printing. The proposed technology innovation will address these two main issues through a novel process and material engineering. In this PFI-TT project, photonic irradiation will be utilized to achieve rapid layer-specific annealing for the metal oxide charge transport layers without damaging the underlying flexible substrate and perovskite absorber layer. The high-quality metal oxide films will not only improve solar cell stability by providing physical protection to the perovskite active layer, but also maintain the efficient charge transport and efficiency, achieving the best of both worlds. In addition, a particular polymer will be added into the perovskite precursor solution to form ultra-smooth and stable perovskite films. With the proposed rapid and layer-specific annealing and incorporation of a particular dendrimer in the perovskite absorber layer, highly-stable perovskite solar cells with efficiency above 20% on flexible substrates will be accomplished.

The existing commercial rehabilitation products cannot efficiently support the upper torso of the patients with serious trunk disability, and do not have intelligent, fine-resolution robot control to train two legs with different impairment levels. An online rehabilitation training without frequent in-person visits to the office of the physical therapist (PT) would reduce the medical cost. This commercialization-oriented project will address those market needs. It will also develop and implement a new customer channel model called ""8C + 5F"",  consisting of 8 communication channels with different types of customers and offering 5 technical facets of this platform. To enhance the academia-industry partnership, the team proposes an effective model called nexus organization (NEO), to achieve transdisciplinary, conflict-free collaborations between the university and the industry. To train future leaders in innovation and entrepreneurship, the team proposes a new education model called Innovation and Marketing-oriented Renaissance Foundry (IMRF) to prepare PhD students and postdoctoral researchers with strong entrepreneurship and innovation skills.

The proposed project aims to build a Holographic intelligent Rehabilitation robotic technology to train post-stroke patients. It has 3 marketing-oriented new designs: i) (Upper trunk exoskeleton with 3D linkage and elastic impedance control): A compact, light-weight and economic upper trunk exoskeleton will be developed for a robot system to improve the upper trunk stability control during rehabilitation. ii) (Intelligent platform control in each phase of intra-gait cycle to handle two-leg impairment asymmetry): Current treadmill control simply changes the speed/force of the treadmill in each gait cycle based on the user's speed or measured center of pressure. However, many patients have different impairment levels between his/her two legs. This PFI will use low-cost thermal/acoustic sensors with deep-learning-based 3D leg trajectory analysis to achieve fine-granularity 4-phase rehabilitation robot control. iii) (Self-engaging mixed reality rehabilitation environment based on holographic telemedicine): The team will extend their previously developed virtual reality (VR)-based design to a hologram-based mixed reality (MR) platform with the advanced telemedicine functions for virtual patient-to-PT or patient-to-patient co-rehab training.

An unexpected failure of a rotating machine may incur high maintenance and downtime costs, reduce customer satisfaction in a produced good, and cause human injuries and fatalities. These consequences not only impact the end user of the rotating machine, but also the machinery manufacturer by tarnishing its reputation and potentially impacting its competitive advantage. This PFI-TT project will accelerate the commercialization of deep learning in predictive maintenance to provide more accurate failure predictions than current solutions and is easily deployed across different types of machines and equipment. By making predictive maintenance practical and scalable, this project is expected to produce major advancements in developing machine systems that are more reliable and safer, as well as incurring lower maintenance and downtime costs than existing systems. Ultimately, the economic competitiveness of the U.S. industrial and agricultural sectors will be enhanced based on more reliable, safer and lower-cost rotating machinery.

The proposed project will create a cost-effective, easy-to-implement, easy-to-scale Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform for remotely monitoring machine health and predicting when and where maintenance actions need to be taken. The core of the proposed IIoT platform is a new deep learning solution that exploits the concepts of physics-based learning, transfer learning and online learning. To date, deep learning approaches to diagnostics/prognostics have been mostly relying on large volumes of training data and largely in isolation from the underlying physics of component faults. This project will overcome these limitations by integrating physics-based modeling and data-driven transfer learning. The resulting solution does not simply use run-to-failure data to train a deep learning model. Instead, training data is used, in conjunction with known physics and previously learned knowledge, to achieve more accurate predictions than possible from using training data alone. Additionally, the solution offers the capability of online learning that may lead to a paradigm shift in machinery prognostics toward unit-specific learning and prediction. The proposed deep learning solution has the potential to make predictive maintenance practical and scalable, thereby significantly promoting the wide-scale adoption of this maintenance strategy.

All biofluids are abundantly populated with small sacs that express specific indicators (biomarkers) when cancer is present. The ability to sample biofluids and detect these indicators is the basis of the ""liquid biopsy"" concept. A liquid biopsy for blood could be incorporated into routine laboratory tests and catch cancer in its earliest stages where intervention is most impactful. A liquid biopsy in urine could be used to replace highly invasive procedures currently used to routinely surveil for recurrence of bladder cancer. This PFI-TT project seeks to hasten the arrival of routine cancer screening through liquid biopsy by fundamentally advancing the way biosensors are used in these assays to make them faster and more sensitive. Educationally, the project will train two talented post-graduate scientists in the key elements of technical entrepreneurship. The project will also maintain several opportunities for undergraduates to conduct academic research including programs supporting under-represented groups and individuals unlikely to otherwise be exposed to research in college. 

The proposed project will advance the concept of the liquid biopsy by developing flow-through sensors that detect cancer biomarkers on extracellular vesicles (EVs) in urine. Current biomarker detection schemes require the analyte to diffuse from the sample to the sensing surface, resulting in slow and often incomplete, responses. The project will emphasis a different paradigm where the sensor is built on a highly permeable membrane and EVs carrying the biomarkers pass through the membrane where they are captured and revealed through enzyme-based detection. The team will develop and optimize the chemistries for capture of biomarkers and development of signal on the ultrathin silicon nitride membranes with precision slit-pores.  The team will also develop mathematical models of flow through slit-pore membranes and the EV capture process. Finally, the team will compare our experiments and models to results with diffusion-limited sensors. This will directly test the hypothesis that the flow-through configuration enables more sensitive and faster responding devices that can improve detection of cancer in liquid biopsies.

The technology has the following market-valued features: the Allomatrix family of polymers uses raw materials from renewable resources, and is a potential replacement of halobutyl rubber, which is used to make the gas-barrier inner liner of car tires and pharmaceutical stoppers. It also has the potential to be used as a rubbery biomaterial that can be processed as plastic and can be recycled, with better combination of properties than silicone rubber. These features provide the following advantages: the performance of commercial halobutyl rubber without the presence of harmful halogens, and an improved cost-effective manufacturing process with a smaller carbon footprint. The Allomatrix technology is important because it uses raw materials from renewable resources, is expected to reduce the carbon footprint of current butyl and halobutyl manufacturing processes (600,000 tons/year), may lead to improved pharmaceutical stoppers and provide improved rubbery biomaterials for saving lives. If successful, this project has the potential to bring back high value-added manufacturing to the USA, creating jobs in the STEM disciplines.  
  The innovative ecosystem that will be created includes partners such as Honeywell, Parker Hannifin, Bridgestone/Firestone, a small biotech company (Innovia), and LG Hausys.  Third party investors include the Rubber Division of the American Chemical Society by creating the International Center of Advanced Elastomers for Healthcare, and the Breast Cancer Innovation Foundation supporting the research if integrating breast reconstruction with cancer diagnosis and treatment. The potential economic impact is expected to be significant, creating new jobs in high value added manufacturing, new commercial products and students well-trained for the created jobs in the next 2-10 years   Students (high-school, undergraduate and graduate) will gain entrepreneurial and technology translation experience through the transfer of the Allomatix technology into commercial products. Students will be motivated and challenged to develop novel ideas, and to defend the feasibility of their ideas in front of industrial partners.  
  This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: to produce halogen-free rubber on a commercial scale that can compete with current halobutyl rubber; reduce the carbon footprint of the manufacturing process; produce thermoplastic biocompatible rubber with a much cheaper and simpler process. The proposed objectives in the PFI:AIR are based on the Allomatrix technology. This new family of materials is the basis for all objectives, thus the first step is to scale up the polymerization and to produce sufficient material for product development and testing. In objective II we aim to develop an optimized sulfur curing system for tire applications, and non-sulfur curing systems for biomedical and other applications. In objective III new application development will be implemented with various partners based on the favorable properties of Allomatrix family of polymers. In objective IV the potential of the reduction of the carbon footprint of the polymerization system is examined. This objective is based on the insight of the polymerization system that was acquired during the development and optimization stages of the CenTiRe project. Lastly, objective V focuses on the examination of the feasibility of the material to be used in biomedical applications, such as investigation of cytotoxicity, material stability under physiological conditions and other aspects.","Kantor, J.; Puskas, J.E.; Kaszas, G.~The effect of reaction conditions on the synthesis of thermoplastic elastomers containing polyalloocimene, polyisobutylene and tapered blocks~Chinese Journal Polymer Science~37~2019~884~~10.1007/s10118-019-2254-8~0~ ~0~ ~22/02/2020 17:27:04.790000000, Puskas, J.E.; Molnar, K.; Jindal, A.~Electrospun Fiber Mats from Poly(alloocimene-isobutylene-alloocimene) Thermoplastic Elastomer~International Journal of Polymeric Materials and Polymeric Biomaterials~Online~2019~~~10.1080/00914037.2018.1563083~0~ ~0~ ~22/05/2019 05:40:27.346000000, Puskas, J.E.; Molnar, K.; Jindal, A.~Electrospun Fiber Mats from Poly(alloocimene isobutylene-alloocimene) Thermoplastic Elastomer~International Journal of Polymeric Materials and Polymeric Biomaterials~69~2020~~~10.1080/00914037.2018.1563083~0~ ~0~ ~22/02/2020 17:27:04.800000000, Puskas, J.

Six companies participated in the project with matching funds: LG Hausys, Honeywell, Parker-Hannifin, Bridgestone/Firestone, Wyatt Technology, Innovia. The Rubber Division of the American Chemical Society and the Breast Cancer Innovation Foundation also supported the project financially. This allowed us to establish a world-class laboratory, fundamental for building the academic-based innovation ecosystem. We purchased a Size Exclusion Chromatography set-up to replace the old system. We also purchased a 3D printer, a UV curing unit, an electrospinning equipment and a Speedmixer (this from Parker-Hannifin matching funds). We also constructed a cryogenic reactor and a mill. The equipment was transferred to OSU where the PI moved into a brand-new laboratory. Funds were also used to buy and install a walk-in fume hood for the cryogenic reactor &ndash; this remained in Akron.

The Allomatrix technology received patent protection in 2017 (Puskas, J.E.; Terpene/isoolefin copolymers having substantially heterogeneous compositional distribution and displaying thermoplastic elastomeric properties; U.S. Patent 9,790,301). PolyFiberMatrix LLC was granted an exclusive license for medical applications in 2018 and is currently developing a medical device in collaboration with Bloodstone Division LLC. Other companies are also interested and negotiations for licenses are ongoing.

An I-Corps project was also developed for less lethal ammunition, and a new company was formed (Polyballistics LLC) with private funding that is developing various products. Market introduction is planned in 2020.

The project contributed to the training of 4 Post-Doctoral Fellows, 5 Ph.D. students, 5 undergraduate students and two high-school students. Philpott Solutions hosted 1 Ph. D. student as an industrial intern for 6 months in 2018.

These coworkers learned new polymerization techniques and characterization methods. They also learned how to write industrial technical reports which are very different from peer-reviewed papers. Close collaboration with industry prepares the students for industry positions by teaching them to appreciate the requirements of corporate culture and importance of deadlines. The coworkers also had the opportunity to learn from senior contributors: Dr. AdelHalasa, retired Goodyear Fellow, Gabor Kaszas, Goodyear, and Dr. Marcia Weidknecht, retired Polymer Science Faculty who regularly attended our weekly group meetings.

The Mentors of the I-CORPs project (Dr. Gabor Kaszas, retired from Goodyear, and Susan Louscher, Foresight Innovation Partners LLC) continued providing great training and insight to our students. They remain closely associated with our group, helping to develop the innovation ecosystem.

The project produced 3 inventions, 1 issued US patent, 8 refereed articles, 4 non-refereed papers, 2 conference proceedings, 5 invited presentations (one Best Graduate Student Presentation Award), and 18 student poster presentations (2 Best Poster Awards).

In summary, a sustainable academic-based innovation ecosystem has been created and will be further developed with OSU?s institutional support.

In contrast to hearing aids that simply make sounds louder, a cochlear implant is surgically placed into the human ear and activates the hearing (auditory) nerve in a way that the brain perceives as sound. Presently, cochlear implants are used less than they can be in the United States, and even more children could benefit from the device. The reasons for the limited utilization include awareness and costs of the device, surgery and follow up care. The pursuit of this PFI project will offer a new way to make cochlear implants with microcoils.  Furthermore, by creating the devices in a way similar to printed electronics, dramatic cost reduction may be realized, along with the natural integration with conventional cochlear implant technologies. This project will also improve the awareness of cochlear implants through outreach and engagement of undergraduate and graduate students, with a focus on underrepresented groups.

The proposed project pursues a novel method to develop microcoils that can fit within the human ear as part of a cochlear implant, the cochlear array. To produce this device, we plan to overcome technology transfer barriers through a novel manufacturing approach relying upon recent advances in additive manufacturing and flexible electronics to rapidly write (print) conductive traces on a polymeric substrate in three-dimension. We then encapsulate the device fully in a biocompatible polymer to realize proof-of-concept microcoils for bench and in-vitro testing. These devices will enable us to overcome the existing knowledge gap in microcoil dimensions, proximity to target auditory neurons, and stimulus parameters through bench and neural cell culture testing. The scientific merit is the demonstration that microcoils can elicit focused neural activity, via magnetically induced electric fields, and enable selective activation of auditory neurons. We will have the baseline data upon which to build our technical case for commercialization. A strong multidisciplinary team consisting of engineers, clinicians, commercialization mentor and domain expert collaborators will partner to pursue translation with the goal of achieving a life-changing intervention for children and adults suffering from severe-to-profound hearing loss.

The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry has been implementing building information modeling (BIM) technology for years. However, current offerings restrict data exchange between platforms. This creates inefficient siloes during the building design and construction process that annually cost the capital facilities industry $15.8 billion. This project will provide the first commercial BIM system that puts interoperability at its core, helping to significantly mitigate these industry losses, using a new data-driven software development (DSD) technology. By applying this technology to building code compliance checking and construction automation, the health and welfare of the American public will be advanced through better quality and more efficiently built facilities. To help develop a more globally competitive American STEM workforce, the results of this project will be incorporated into existing undergraduate/graduate courses, and a 'Construction Ready' training program. Ultimately, this innovation will enhance the understanding and application of BIM technology to help the building and construction industry achieve improved efficiency and reduced time, cost, and human-induced errors. The R&D results will also transfer well to the infrastructure domain. 

The proposed project aims to develop an interoperable BIM prototype system for automating building code compliance checking and modular construction analysis. This will bridge a critical gap in the AEC sector by connecting the currently-isolated BIM applications involved in the design and construction phases of an AEC project. This PFI project builds upon the DSD technology and the automated code compliance checking technology developed by the PIs. The DSD technology enables BIM interoperability by using invariant features of objects in BIM, which is radically different from existing approaches that rely on standardization or term-based semantics. It is the key to achieving seamless interoperability between different applications. The development of the prototype system will use an iterative method to constantly improve its performance. The planned prototype system will be tested in checking building designs with quantitative requirements of International Building Codes, and analyzing the design for modular construction automation. A 100% recall of missing information and noncompliance cases is sought after. New knowledge will be created about the implementation of the DSD technology so that it can be better utilized to develop other BIM-based applications and eventually lead to a comprehensive BIM solution with seamless interoperability between all applications.

However, current sensors are hard, rigid, bulky and dependent on fragile cables that can act as a nidus for infection in contaminated traumatic wounds. The associated surgical retrieval procedures, meanwhile, are costly and they subject patients to distress associated with re-operation and expose them to additional complications. On the other hand, bioresorbable electronics can be used for post-surgical monitoring of organ, tissue, implant, and wound health without the need for surgical extraction, thus reducing the risk of infection and complications during and after the surgical processes. The proposed innovation will open up numerous and diverse applications in medical, security, and consumer markets. Bioresorbable electronics can potentially move much closer to commercial reality in the next few years, with the promise of revolutionary advances in health care and environmental protection, resulting in broad social and economic impacts. Technology leadership in these areas will increase the economic competitiveness of the United States, advancing the health and welfare of the American public, enhancing partnerships between academia and industry, and developing an American STEM workforce that is globally competitive.

The proposed project is to develop a bioresorbable bio-implantable multi-functional optical probe for simultaneous monitoring of brain intracranial pressure (ICP), temperature, and oxygenation. The initial target market of the technology is brain monitors for the efficient treatment of patients during recovery following a severe Traumatic brain injury (TBI). With this NSF PFI-PR project, various technical challenges at the interface between optics, electronic/optical materials, processes of bio-resorption, brain interfaces, advanced manufacturing, and commercial scaling will be addressed. The modular design approach proposed here involves an implantable bioresorbable probe head coupled to a pluggable/flexible external optical head, to shorten the product design cycle and reduce the cost. The self-compensating design for the fully bioresorbable optical/temperature sensor system will ensure accurate readings of physiological parameters, which are typically sensitive to environmental variations. A built-in self-calibration evanescent waveguide sensor pair enables autonomous long-term sensor accuracy. This bioresorbable systems can be designed to have the specific functional lifetimes, after which all of the constituent materials under complete bio-absorption, thereby eliminating the need for surgery, and associated risks to the patient, to remove the devices. Additionally, electrically passive operation and complete immunity to electromagnetic interference represent two important advantages of the proposed optical pressure sensors.

A MG can create speed change without any physical contact and therefore no gear lubrication is required.  A MG has inherent overload protection capabilities as well as no backlash. By eliminating most mechanical losses MGs offer the potential for increased efficiency whilst providing a longer service life than its mechanical counterpart.  This PFI will focus on translating the MG technology towards commercial application in the areas of renewable energy generation and robotic actuation.  There is a growing need for a new power conversion approach that are more efficient and more reliable than existing mechanical gearboxes and direct-drive generators. For instance, one barrier to increasing the use of wind power generation is the reliability of the drivetrain.  By developing a new type of MG, the reliability and efficiency of the drivetrain could be greatly improved, whilst still being compact in size.  This would thereby reduce the levelized cost of power generation.  In addition, robotic actuators are increasingly being sort that are more reliable and have compliant capabilities, a MG offers such capabilities.  


The proposed project aims to demonstrate that a multistage MG has the potential to attain a competitive torque-to-mass ratio and torque-to-volume ratio with traditional gearboxes whilst also being more reliable, efficient and quieter than existing mechanical gearboxes.  The proposed project will utilize 3-D printing to increase the rate at which design improvements can be made to a unique Halbach rotor MG typology.  A series of MGs will be tested in order to refine and develop a greater understanding of the MG capabilities relative to their mechanical counterparts.  Using prototype devices, a direct cost-performance analysis of the MG technology relative to equivalent mechanical gearbox counterparts will be completed for the first time. The demonstration that a MG can be performance competitive with a mechanical gearbox, whilst also have a significantly longer design life, could transform the way in which power conversion is accomplished.  A MG could therefore find uses in a myriad of applications throughout society. The graduate and undergraduate student involved with this project will receive technology translation and entrepreneurship experiences through the prototype development and commercialization activities associated with this project.

The conversion of electricity to warm natural light in a lighting application depends heavily on the performance of red emitting materials, while the performance of cutting edge luminescent displays, including microdisplays and televisions, can be improved by narrow band red and green emitters. So called ""quantum dots"" can be optimized to produce a desired luminescence wavelength and the stable, bright luminescence required by these applications. If quantum dots can be manufactured in a cost effective manner and withstand the harsh conditions found on LED chips, they would simultaneously improve the color, efficiency, and cost of lighting and displays. This would lead to more rapid penetration of these technologies and save up to 1% of global energy or more. The successful implementation of quantum dots in lighting and emissive displays will therefore increase the economic competitiveness of the United States, while enhancing the health and welfare of the American public.

The method utilizes a patented ""one pot"" synthetic strategy and patented synthesis reagents that are inexpensive, air stable, and nontoxic and have tunable conversion kinetics. The approach controls quantum dot structure with levels of precision not possible previously, an important advance from traditional quantum dot synthesis; a notoriously Edissonian process of trial and error. The novel reagents and the ""one pot"" synthesis produce quantitative reaction yields, facilitating a highly scalable method that reduces the challenge of quantum dot manufacturing on scales required for broad adoption in solid state lighting and emissive display markets. These quantum dots will be encapsulated and tested on LED chips to determine their long term stability. Outer layers of the quantum dots will be optimized to improve this long term stability and to enhance their performance on LED chips used in display and down lighting applications.

This PFI-TT project developed red-emitting Quantum Dots (QDs) capable of producing bright red light when deposited on light emitting diodes (LEDs) used in solid state lighting (SSL). The QD architectures were optimized to reach higher levels of performance needed for long term operation in SSL. The PFI-TT team also developed methods to grow ZnS shells on QDs that stabilize the photoluminescence quantum efficiency under LED operating conditions. The technology would capture a large portion of the SSL market, including office down lighting.

Intellectual Merit. The intellectual merit of the proposed work rests in the novel and highly tunable synthesis of high performance QD architectures. A ""one pot"" synthetic strategy and synthesis reagents that are inexpensive, air stable, and nontoxic and have tunable conversion kinetics. The novel reagents and the ""one pot"" synthesis produce quantitative reaction yields, and facilitate a highly scalable method that reduces the challenge of QD manufacturing on scales required for broad adoption in SSL.

Broader Impacts. Improved red-emitting down conversion materials can increase the luminous efficiency of warm, white LEDs, which will dramatically improve the adoption of SSL by consumers. By replacing conventional phosphors used in SSL with high performance QD phosphors &gt; 1% reduction in global energy consumption is possible. Successful adoption of our QD technology will therefore increasing the economic competitiveness of the United States, while enhancing the health and welfare of the American public.

The global internet traffic has continued to grow exponentially, fueled by the increase of mobile devices and cloud-based applications for artificial intelligence, video streaming, social networking as well as enterprise compute/collaborate needs. A majority of the data traffic remains within the datacenter. The number of hyperscale datacenters will double in five years. Each of these hyperscale datacenters houses hundreds of thousands of servers and consumes 100 MW of power. Such growth is not sustainable without fundamental changes in how datacenter is designed. Scalable photonic switches with fast response time and low power consumption can improve the efficiency and performance of datacenters. Optical switching is agnostic to data rate, unlike the electrical packet switches in current networks. It enables programmable datacenter networks, allowing the network to adjust its topology to match the traffic patterns of applications.

The proposed project will accelerate the development and commercialization of scalable silicon photonic switches and make them widely available to datacenters and telecommunication industry. Current optical switches in the market are bulky, slow, and expensive. In this PFI-TT, we propose to replace the bulk optical switches with fully integrated (single chip) silicon photonic switches. Silicon photonics use complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) foundries to mass produce photonic integrated circuits at low cost, leveraging economies of scale of the multi-trillion-dollar microelectronics industry. We use micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) actuation to dramatically reduce the optical insertion loss and power consumption. Silicon photonic switches with microsecond response time and low optical loss will revolutionize datacenter networks. The anticipated outputs of this program include a prototype switch with proven reliability and a strategy to scale up production. The ultimate goal is to spin out a new company building switching subsystems supplying to both datacenter and the telecommunications industry.

This will make treatment accessible to patients who don?t have access to an expert surgeon, and to those who are ineligible for a long complex surgery.

The proposed project will develop a prototype for the minimally invasive surgical tool which will be fully integrated. Research objectives include: the development of an anatomically correct urethral model, iterative manufacture and testing of device sub-components, and integration of sub-components into the complete device for functional testing in the urethral model. 
Sub-component testing will include measuring the forces exerted upon the graft used for reconstruction during various steps of the procedure, to ensure that the final integrated device design can successfully deliver a graft, and not cause damage to the graft upon device removal. Once sub-components have been tested and modified as needed, they will be integrated into the complete device for testing functionality in the urethral model. The resulting integrated prototype will be fully functional, and be ready for use in a future pilot study in an animal model (beyond PFI-TT).

The broader impacts also include expanding participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM and preparing students for entrepreneurship. Organs are scarce resources because of the gap between the organs needed and those available. Additionally, the short time span of the available organs in current organ preservation solutions limits the number of organs can be transported and transplanted into patients and which people can be considered for the organs further aggravating organ shortage and lowering organ transplantation success rates. The composition of the preservation solutions is crucial for the lifespan of the preserved organs. AFP-based systems have the potential to preserve cells, tissues, organs for a longer period outside the body and thus could provide valuable data and reduce the costs in various areas including organ/tissue transplantation, biomedical research and drug discovery. This project focuses on translating AFP-based systems for organ preservation.


The proposed project addresses the key technology and knowledge gaps as it translates from research discovery towards commercial application. Based on the characteristics of AFP-based systems including highly effectiveness, compatibility to existing solutions, and multifunction, AFP-based systems could be a potential advanced technology for cells, tissues, and organs preservation. However, significant technology and knowledge gaps hinder the technology translation. In this PFI project, a multidisciplinary team will validate the proposed technology and fill the knowledge gaps of highly active AFPs in the AFP-based systems towards the technology translation and commercialization. In particular, the potency of AFP-based systems in cold preservation will be systematically validated for pancreatic cells, tissues, and organs. Moreover, toxicity profiles of the key ingredients in AFP-based systems, that is highly active AFPs, will be established on representative mammalian cell lines. Furthermore, a scalable approach for preparing the potent AFPs will be developed.

Intellectual Merit: This PFI AIR project led to advancements in several fronts. First, a 4 ? 4 pneumatic tactile display with Braille standard resolution using a bistable electroactive polymer thin film and serpentine-patterned carbon nanotube electrode was successfully demonstrated. The bistable electroactive polymer is a variable stiffness material that exhibits stiffness change of 3000-fold within a narrow temperature range. The carbon nanotube electrode was patterned on the polymer film via a patented process which led to a serpentine-patterned composite electrode that is highly stretchable, retains its high electrical conductivity up to ~200% area strain, and provides fast Joule heating rate. The tactile pixels are diaphragm actuators that can be individually controlled to produce 0.7 mm out of plain deformation and greater than 50 g of blocking force by application of local heating and pneumatic pressure. The device can operate under low voltage supply and has a lifetime of over 100,000 cycles. Prototype Braille electronic reader device was also fabricated using a PCB board comprising an array of Joule heating pixels to switch the Braille dots in a 4x10 braill cell panel. While the raised heights of the dots are not uniform, the effort identified key technical challenges to be overcome before technology transition is viable.  

Broader Impacts: The demand for tactile interactive devices has been growing exponentially as the sense of touch enriches the human-machine interaction experience. However, tactile devices reported so far cannot offer high quality performance, compact form factor, and relatively simple system architecture for low cost production. This work could open a path to building compact, user friendly, and cost-effective tactile devices for a variety of important applications. The envisioned Braille electronic readers could significantly benefit adults with vision impairment and improve the education of blind children. 

Graduate students and undergraduate students participated in the project received multidisciplinary training in materials chemistry, processing techniques, thin film deposition, clean room operation, and various optical and electrical characterization techniques. The trainees were also provided the opportunities to participate in group discussions, make Powerpoint presentation, and write research reports. The graduate student participants interacted with industrial researchers on product concept development and understanding market needs. The undergraduate student participants gained experience in collaborating with other team members.

Abstract

The goal NSF PFI: AIR-TT SAP-SPICE is to demonstrate a scalable high-performance power simulator with up to 3 orders of magnitude higher performance per cost result of other commercially available physical level power estimation tools.  In NSF CNS #0905596 Green Edge Network, we discovered a novel on-line digital hardware power measurement instruments and machine learning algorithm for integrated circuits that is superior to the state-of-the-art on-chip methods.  However, upon further research we also discovered that the same core technique can be applied to circuit simulators to significantly accelerate power simulation with lower memory requirement. Our project integrates (1) a power simulator partitioning algorithm suitable for cloud computing platforms, (b) a machine-learning driven self-calibrating power model for simulation software, and (c) a simplified result extraction and evaluation output.  These features provide significant advantages in system cost, performance, and accuracy of simulated power estimation when compared to the lead technology in circuit simulation market.   The SAP-SPICE is important because the techniques developed for the prototype have broader applicability to other areas of computing such as low power computing, high performance server systems, and consumer appliances such as mobile phones. Indeed, all the technology trends suggest a future where a fine-grained energy accounting system will be an integral part of most computing devices.  As expected, the findings of this research project are the key factors behind a patent and licensing negotiations with two independent integrated circuit companies.

Today, the integrated circuit (IC) design industry desperately needs highly accurate power simulation technology that is fast.  Many commercial simulation tools resort to trading off accuracy for increased speed by leveraging much less accurate (up to plus or minus 30% error) macro models to produce power specification for each design.  When such large error is made worse by process variations on fabricated chips, power simulations are often found to no longer play a significant role in improving system performance or chip yield.  As this project translates from research discovery toward commercial application, the translated product(s) will fill the technology gap in the power simulation technology to enable improvements in chip-yield and low-power consumption in modern ICs.

The potential economic impact is expected to increase rapidly in the next five to ten years to affect a significant portion of $300B IC market.  More specifically, our work will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the future of power-aware IC industry.

The Bio-modified Recycled Asphalt Shingle (BRAS) is important because it enables the use of scrap shingles, which are otherwise being disposed of in landfills, to be upgraded for use as a supplementary product to asphalt binder. This technology is significant because asphalt supplies are diminishing rapidly since the advent and adaptation of coking technologies by refineries. Accordingly, this PFI project will result in a proof-of-concept for BRAS for use in pavement construction. The newly developed product, BRAS, is low-cost, durable and environmentally friendly, features that improve pavement service life while reducing pavement construction cost and carbon footprint. In addition, the production of BRAS uses products from two waste streams (scrap shingles and animal waste), which also provides a cost-effective waste management solution. Thus, BRAS is superior in terms of cost savings, extended durability, environmental impact and energy savings when compared to the existing products in the construction industry.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The supply of asphalt binder found in scrap shingles are highly oxidized from years of prior service. Oxidation typically disturbs colloidal stability of asphalt structure by converting maltene portions and increasing asphaltene aggregation. Accordingly, this PFI project is using specific molecular species extracted from animal waste to restore asphalt stability and enhance its properties. A multi-scale modeling and characterization followed by experiments and prototyping will be used to develop BRAS with properties similar to that of virgin asphalt binder.  The project will involve research scholars and students with mechanical, chemical and material science expertise to undertake this research. Students and scholars involved in the project will receive entrepreneurship training while conducting customer interviews and meetings with potential industry partners to facilitate technology scale-up.","Jawad, Mohammed and Fini, Elham H. and Abu-Lebdeh, Taher M.~Investigating the Efficacy of a Bio-Based Modifier to Improve the Rheological Properties of Recycled Asphalt Shingles~American Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences~10~2017~~~10.3844/ajeassp.2017.165.174~10036420~165 to 174~10036420~OSTI~14/03/2020 14:11:23.543000000",,"It was shown that severity of aging highly affects effectiveness of rejuvenator. For instance, roofing shingles in states with more UV exposure show more signs of aging than those will less irradiation intensity as reflected in extent of formation of asphaltene nanoaggregates, which increases as aging severity increases. Therefore, chemical structure and content of rejuvenator should be tuned for the level of aging of specific roofing shingles to be most effective. Various bio-rejuvenators contain different amount of continuous and interrupted conjugates. The theoretical results obtained by quantum-mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations show that both continuous and interrupted conjugates are effective to weaken the &pi;-inter-sheet forces and decrease the size of asphaltene nano-aggregates found in aged asphalt, with interrupted conjugates being more efficient than continuous conjugates to deagglomerate  asphaltene nanoaggregate. Due to their limited partial entrance into the nanoaggregates, interrupted conjugates are not trapped inside the asphaltene stacks interlayer and can easily detach from the stacks. This allows an interrupted conjugate not to be consumed in interaction with one asphaltene stack, making the interrupted conjugate available to affect many other stacks in the matrix. In an attempt to tune bio-rejuvenator for severely aged roofing shingles found in Arizona, in the next cycle, we will continue working with local industry and evaluate efficacy of rejuvenation in laboratory and real field sections.

Such mass gathering events are growing in popularity, and thus require significant resources to ensure safety and success. To date, event management tools have not grown to meet this need.  This project is designed to address these gaps in event management tools.   The research proposed in this project significantly expands the development of a Data Visualization System focused on medical preparedness for mass gathering events, originally conceived for marathons. This system was created for event organizers and relevant stakeholders to effectively manage and oversee all participants, monitor the dynamic location of participants, and manage health and safety resources throughout the event, both under normal operating conditions and in the event that emergency issues arise.  The system provides a dynamic representation of the flow of people and resources: at the core is a novel simulation tool that predicts and displays runner density on the course over time.  The data visualization system is the first comprehensive dashboard for endurance event management.  The project will result in a significant ramp-up of the current prototype of the data visualization system to expand functionality and make the system more turn-key.  The project will also result in the development of a business plan for commercialization, working with Northwestern University's Innovations and New Ventures Office (INVO). While this system was initially developed for marathons, its applicability can go beyond endurance events.

This project addresses several important technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The innovation of the data visualization system comes from the integration of data visualization, participant and resource flow simulation, event data, and event management services. As such, the next steps towards commercialization will require advances in data analytics related to event data and operations research decision tools that leverage the data analysis.  System capabilities will be expanded in new directions to allow us to scale up the technology for broader applicability.  The project focuses in three areas: (1) upgrading the simulation model to capture additional flows of resources and participants; (2) merging new streams of event data to more fully capture the nuances of mass gathering events, and (3) developing new event management services that improve decision making for mass gathering events.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate and graduate students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through INVO.  In particular, INVO offers a series of internship and fellowship programs for these students.

Intellectual merit.  This project filled several important technology gaps in translating from research discovery toward commercial application.  The innovation comes from the integration of data visualization, participant and resource flow simulation, event data, and event management services with advances in data analytics related to event data and operations research decision tools that leverage the data analysis.

Broader impacts. The system continues to be deployed at major mass participation events.  Through the course of the project, SAFE was expanded to include more features and visualizations.  In 2018, the team won the Innovative Applications in Analytics Award from INFORMS for their work.   In addition to the graduate student training, the project included significant undergraduate involvement through  field observations, data analysis, and model development.

The NanoPaste is important because it would give these industries access to a more environmentally friendly product that would not depend on leaded components and manufacturing facilities.  These industries are currently exempt from international regulations banning the use of lead-based solders and components because of the lack of proven reliability of current lead-free materials. In addition, access to leaded components and manufacturing facilities is becoming increasingly difficult, making for an uncertain future of reliable supplies of materials.  This technology could also benefit other electronic sectors that require high reliability, such as power electronics and communications. 

A prototype of the new nanocomposite solder paste will be developed under this project that is suitable for commercial evaluation and production testing. The NanoPaste has two unique features: homogeneous elements and compositions, and lower processing temperature during manufacturing. These features provide significant advantages, including reduced thermal stress on the printed circuit board (PCB) and enhanced reliability of solder joints, as compared to the leading competing lead-based solders in these market segments.

The following tasks will be performed in this project in order to develop a homogeneous NanoPaste to translate to commercial application: (1) scale-up synthesis and formulation, (2) prototyping multi-component test vehicles with NanoPaste through board design, stencil printing, and solder reflow, and (3) full commercial characterization by performing industry-standard electrical and mechanical tests (shear and pull tests) and reliability tests (thermal cycling, corrosion, vibration and drop tests). In addition, personnel involved in this project, including undergraduates, graduates, and post-docs, will receive innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation experiences through experimentation and analysis, industrial site visits, custom interviews, and business development.

The structural and thermal properties of the nanosolders and NanoPaste, and some significant issues with nanosolders such as surface oxidation, have been probed and investigated by using several techniques including SEM, TEM, XRD, DSC, and TGA. It was observed that surface oxidation played a significant role in the melting of nanoparticles, and homogeneous mixing between nanosolders and micro-sized solder powders, together with flux chemistry, ensured successful solder paste printing and solder reflow. Addition of solder nanoparticles in the NanoPaste helped increase the mechanical strength of the solder joints formed between the NanoPaste and Cu substrate and suppressed the intermetallic compound formation and growth along the solder joint interface. Thermal aging and thermal cycling measurements help understand the reliability of the solder joints formed by these NanoPastes. Through this project, one patent has been officially granted in June 2020, and three journal papers have been generated, with one paper published in Thermochimica Acta and two papers submitted for external review; in addition, one more journal paper is currently being prepared. Seven graduate students, two undergraduate students (including one REU student), and one high school student have been involved in this project, through which one Ph.D. Dissertation, two Master's theses and one undergraduate Honor's thesis have been generated. The graduate students also interacted with our industrial partners through the NSF INTERN program, by visiting the industrial partners, giving them research presentations on our recent development of the nanocomposite solder pastes, and exploring the practical applications of these NanoPaste materials. The graduate students have given more than ten conference presentations in TMS Annual Meetings, Materials Science &amp; Technology (MS&amp;T) Conferences, MRS Fall Meeting, International Conference on Nanojoining and Microjoining (NMJ), FUTURECAR Technology Conference at Georgia Tech, NSF Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) Grantee Conference, and Pan Pacific Microelectronics Symposium (Pan Pacific), and the PI has been invited to give research seminars and invited talks in universities, conferences and corporations.

These facts have hampered the adoption of molecular sensors despite immense industrial and scientific interest from the fields of forensics, toxicology, and biomedicine. Highly scalable and inexpensive, SERF (Sensitive Erasable Reproducible Flow-through) sensors will lead to an era of ubiquitous molecular identification devices for diverse applications such as biometric and health screening, trace hazard detection (biohazards, toxins, drugs, and explosive residues), and chemical quality control. In addition to affordable manufacturing, the SERF technology has a 7 fold higher sensitivity and greater uniformity than the leading commercial substrate (Klarite(TM); Renishaw Inc.). The SERF sensor also has first-of-a-kind capabilities in flow-through detection and surface cleaning for reuse. The project will identify the most commercially viable molecular target for the SERF sensor and optimize the material and a prototype for the detection of this molecule. 

This project addresses several technology gaps as it translates a laboratory discovery into a commercial application. First, composed of a high density of optically responsive nanopores rather than the low-density micropatterned features, the SERF sensor improves both the sensitivity and uniformity of detection compared to the leading photonic-based sensors. Second, as a porous structure the SERF technology allows sample flow through the sensor, overcoming diffusion limited response times that are impractical (days) for trace molecules with existing sensors. Finally, the SERF sensor can be reused or cleaned with the application of a small current through its contiguous metallic surface. This feature can be used to reset sensors and to overcome performance loss due to fouling.

Intellectual Merit: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focused on the development of a novel nanoporous sensor for molecular detection. Adding Au and MgF2 to a nanoporous silicon nitride membrane platform, we created SERF (Sensitive Erasable Reproducible Flow-through) surface enhanced Raman (SERS) sensors. These sensors display a 7 fold higher sensitivity and greater uniformity than the leading commercial SERS substrate (Klarite; Renishaw Inc.). The SERF sensor also have a first-of-a-kind capabilities in flow-through detection and surface cleaning for reuse.

We developed new electron-microscopy based tools for the characterizing the ultrastructure of pores and used this tool to uncover the relationship between structure and optimal SERS response. Specifically we established that MgF2 and thin gold depositions &lt; 15 nm are necessary for the optimal response. We also established that removing SiN was not necessary for an optimal response. This result is significant because it enables SiN to serve as a support structure and significantly increase the strength of SERF sensors and enable manufacturing at high yield at the wafer scale.

Broader Impacts: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project supported 2 undergraduate REUs and both the graduate and entrepreneurial training for a doctoral candidate in Biomedical Engineering. We completed a preliminary business canvas by conducting customer discovery and concluded that sub 100 nm extracellular vesicles containing cancer biomarkers represented the most valuable product-market fit. More broadly, given the manufacturability and improved performance of the SERF sensors, we expect them to lead to an era of ubiquitous molecular identification devices for diverse applications such as biometric and health screening, trace hazard detection (biohazards, toxins, drugs, and explosive residues), and chemical quality control.

Buildings represent an important context for complex service systems. Americans spend 90% of their time inside buildings. Buildings accounted for near 40% of U.S. energy consumption in 2011, 75% of which was electrical energy. The energy expenditure in the building market is huge: in 2011, more than $431B was spent on energy. The climate-change footprint of buildings is correspondingly large, and the energy performance of buildings is poor, as measured by occupant comfort surveys. The modest goal of building professionals ""that 80% of occupants should be satisfied with the thermal, air quality, acoustic, and lighting environments"" is almost never met in practice.  Though reducing energy consumption is a strategic national policy issue, comfort should not be overlooked, and the relationship between comfort and energy use must be taken into account. This project relies on a crowd-based control system for gathering occupant comfort data and managing building systems.

ThermoVote is a platform technology for gathering and analyzing thermal comfort data from large numbers of building users and for controlling building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in real-time. It provides a critical link in a complex service system to enable smart control of building infrastructure. This project uses ThermoVote as a crowd-based environment control system in new building environments to harden the platform technology, integrate it with new building systems, and develop service scenarios and related components to implement the ThermoVote approach on a large scale. From an engineering perspective, design of complex systems given large numbers of participants has rarely been studied. From a cognitive perspective, complex, distributed cognitive systems have rarely been studied. From an interdisciplinary perspective, design of engineering systems has rarely been done given deep knowledge of complex multiple feedback loops created by interactions of large numbers of people and technologies. There are several key innovations to the project: use of real buildings to show system benefits; investigation of both individual and group behavior to save energy by adjustable autonomy; and novel algorithms using multiple criteria optimization (e.g., energy consumption and preferences). And there are a number of open questions: How can we design effective learning systems that are controlled by large groups?  How should a system portray its changing behavior?  What are the best schemes for indirect or direct control? Many questions lie at the intersection of systems and people.

This project is led by faculty in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science group of the School of Engineering at the University of California, Merced, with participation by faculty in Management and Cognitive Science at the University of California, Merced.

Energy management and space conditioning in buildings is affected by many factors, but the most critical are centered around usage patterns and thermal comfort, as well as energy pricing and local energy generation. 

Our research takes a fresh look at some of these problems of comfort and cost in building management given our experiences with ThermoVote, a novel platform technology for gathering thermal comfort feedback and implementing effective and efficient thermal control of buildings. ThermoVote was developed at the University of California, Merced, for gathering and analyzing thermal comfort data from large numbers of building users and for controlling building heating and cooling systems in real-time with minimal input from building users. ThermoVote can provide a critical link in a complex service system to enable smart control of building infrastructure. In this PFI:BIC project, we explored the user experience and effectiveness of ThermoVote as a crowd-based environment control in a new building environment and with new user experience designs. We deployed the ThermoVote system in 3 different buildings to test the effectiveness of several user interface designs in a 40 week user study. The results show that certain designs can  increase user satisfaction with thermal conditions from 33.9% to 93.3% and reduce energy consumption up to 37%.

Mid- and low-rise buildings comprise the majority of buildings in the United States. The mid-rise multi-family homes (4-9 stories) are becoming the housing trend to meet the increasing demands of population growth and urbanization. The use of cold-formed steel (CFS) would be highly cost-effective for mid-rise light-framed buildings. However the existing shear wall technologies impede the use of CFS in mid-rises due to the requirements of non-combustibility and high structural performance (shear strength, stiffness, ductility). The project will result in a prototype of the proposed non-combustible high-performance steel shear wall technology. This new technology has the following unique features: a) it uses the perforation in the sheathing as energy dissipating fuses to achieve high ductility; b) it uses the corrugation in the sheathing to achieve high strength and stiffness; c) it uses only CFS members; d) the sheathing to framing connection method is optimized for high efficiency; e) it has the same thickness as the non-shear walls; and f) it enables the engineers to control the damage locations to be away from critical building components. These features provide the following advantages over the current state-of-the-art technologies: higher structural performance, lower overall cost, non-combustibility, and controllable failure mechanism when compared to the leading competing technologies, namely the wood based panel shear wall, the steel sheet shear wall, the steel-gypsum composite panel shear wall, and the diagonal steel strap bracing shear wall in the mid-rise construction market.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. It will investigate the feasibility of positioning the corrugated deck within the CFS frame in order to form standard wall thicknesses while maintaining high structural performances. A major research effort will be made to maximize the shear wall performance by developing optimal parameters in perforation, corrugation, and CFS framing details via numerical simulations and full-scale experiments. In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate and graduate students, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through modeling, building, and testing CFS shear walls. The potential economic impact is expected to be significant for the mid-rise construction industry, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in building industries.   

The project involves research collaboration between the University of North Texas and two industrial partners, Verco Decking Inc. and Nucor Building Systems. The industrial partners will provide deck manufacturing capacities, assist in developing an efficient connection method, and guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort.","Mahdavian, M.*, Zhang, W.*, Ding, Chu, Moen, C., Yu, C.~Cyclic Simulation of Cold-Formed Steel Shear Walls with Corrugated Steel Sheathing~Proceedings of Annual Stability Conference~~2016~~~~0~ ~0~ ~03/08/2016 12:55:34.470000000, Zhang, W.*, Wang, J.*, Mahdavian, M.*, Yu, C.~Seismic Performance of Cold-Formed Steel Framed Buildings using Corrugated Sheet Shear Walls~Proceedings of the 2016 ASCE Geotechnical and Structural Engineering Congress~~2016~~~~0~ ~0~ ~03/08/2016 12:55:34.480000000",,"The key outcome of this NSF PFI:AIR-TT project is the invention of a novel structural panel system, and in particular in-frame fluted cold-formed steel shear wall system using corrugated steel sheets for light framed buildings. The in-frame fluted panel system offers significantly improved strength, stiffness, and ductility within a reduced wall thickness. The in-frame fluted panel system further allows for easier construction and lower cost per unit strength than the conventional systems for mid- and high-rise buildings. The project conducted full-scale wall panel tests to optimize the configuration design and obtain the nominal shear strength and deflection characteristics. Nonlinear finite element analysis was performed on multiple building archetypes to quantify the seismic performance factors for the new structural system. The experiments and analyses indicate that the new structural panel system is a viable high-performance lateral force resisting system for buildings in seismic areas. The idea of using corrugated sheathing with an in-frame fluted configuration can be applied to many other structural types where high shear strength is required and space is limited. The research team is currently utilizing the new structural panel design to develop the next generation of Army tactical shelters. The PFI:AIR-TT project created collaborative research partnership between the academy (University of North Texas) and the industry (Verco Desking &ndash; a Nucor company).

However, a natural biological tendency among teenagers to stay up later in the evening combined with early morning start times at most schools can result in a lack of sleep among middle and high school students that can impact their classroom performance. Research has shown that various properties of indoor lighting can influence the human cycle of sleep and wakefulness, known as circadian rhythm.  This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project from Brown University aims to better understand those light properties and design a dynamic, intelligent lighting system that can effectively shift the circadian phase of students to help them remain alert and focused during the school day.

The project aspires to advance smart lighting by developing a wireless networked biophilic lighting system that will deliver lighting tunable in terms of spectral band(s), intensity, directionality, duration, and season.  An essential first step will be to determine the efficacy of this system in suppressing the production of melatonin, a hormone that mediates the circadian cycle.  Working with Digital Lumens, the team members will design and integrate several of these wirelessly networked LED systems that are equipped with sensors and actuators.  They will then test them in the Sleep Labs of Brown University/Bradley Hospital, via the monitoring and control of the lighting conditions, and analyze the physiological responses in real time.  The ""prescriptions"", in the form of control algorithms and wireless networked control and sensor modules, will be the basis for field-tests in a local school, conducted in cooperation with school administrators, teachers, parents, and students.

The project will be undertaken by an interdisciplinary collaboration between the laboratories of Professor Jimmy Xu, from Brown University's School of Engineering, and Professor Mary Carskadon, from the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown University's Warren Alpert Medical School. The industrial partner is Digital Lumens (Boston, MA), a small business pioneer in the development and implementation of next-generation LED lighting solutions.","Emily Toomey, Jimmy Xu, Simon Vecchioni, Lynn Rothschild, Shalom Wind, and Gustavo E.

A primary reason for this challenge is that a natural, biologically-mediated, circadian phase delay begins in early adolescence, which means that preferred bedtimes, rise times, and times of peak alertness and performance occur later in the day.  The ideal solution to this problem is to delay school start times; however, several practical and economic considerations prevent this from occurring in many school districts.

 With recent advances in lighting technology, a feasible alternative to delaying school start times involves advancing the circadian rhythms of preteens to match the already established school start times. Circadian rhythms are ~24-hour cycles in human physiology that cause events such as sleep, alertness, mood, hormone release, etc. to be favored at certain times of the day. Light is the most potent stimulus to entrain and shift circadian rhythms. Recent studies indicate that the circadian system is most sensitive to light with spectral content near 460 nm. As the modern pre-teen/teen spends a significant portion of the day indoors, properly tuned, circadian-focused illumination could significantly improve their performance, productivity, sleep and overall wellbeing.

 The ultimate goal of our project is to develop a dynamic plan for implementing a biologically-informed lighting system in a school setting, providing the basis for future innovations in biophilic lighting.  The project had 3 phases.  Phase 1 of the project included prototype system development and testing in the sleep laboratory to confirm that the spectral compositions and intensity of the lighting affected cognitive functioning and circadian markers.  Phase 2 consisted of scaling the system for use in schools and testing the impact of the system on performance and circadian phase in a mock-classroom lab setting.  Phase 3 was the deployment of the lighting system into a middle school classroom and testing whether the system affected circadian rhythms, sleep, performance and mood in a real-world middle school classroom population.

 Several challenges were encountered during the implementation of Phase 3. One of the principal challenges concerned establishing a mutually beneficial set of conditions that enabled our industry partner (Lighting Science Group) to provide the hardware and installation expertise to realize Phase 3. Other challenges were associated with obtaining permissions to conduct the experiments from several levels of administration (e.g., IRB, school?s superintendent/City of Providence, school?s principal, teachers, parents, and students), and navigating through the associated bureaucratic processes. Once the Phase 3 study was in course, challenges emerged with properly controlling extraneous sources of lights (e.g. the windows at Nathan Bishop School were had blinds that only partially blocked sunlight, and we were not allowed to modify them), as well as with tampering with the system components by students and some of the teachers. Some shortcomings of our implementation also became apparent. For example, our controller modules did not have a real-time clock, which meant that frequent trips to the school were necessary to reset clocks every time the systems were tampered with.

 Despite these challenges, the project was successful. The experiment of Phase 3 produced results that confirm our initial hypothesis that circadian-enhanced lighting, deployed in a real-world scenario of school classrooms, with real students and teachers, can positively affect the alertness, mood, focus and performance of school children. Overall, the steps leading to the Phase 3 experiments were effective at providing the necessary groundwork for making Phase 3 successful. The various challenges faced in this project also served as a reminder that the process of translating laboratory-based research to real-world scenarios is often unpredictable and fraught with obstacles, but which can offer very rewarding outcomes for both researchers and for those who directly participated and benefit from the research outcomes.

 Specifically, the outcome of this project was that the smart lighting system promoted a phase advance in students who received the most hours of morning light from the system (average of 11hours/week) compared to students who received an average of 8 hours or less of morning light.  These findings support the underlying concept that morning light in the classroom can modify circadian timing in a manner that may help ""protect"" middle school-aged children with early start times. They provide timely guidance and can serve as a ""platform for innovation (PFI)"" to biophilic lighting system designs and engineering that are anticipated to follow as part of the next phase of the lighting revolution.

 This effort also enables other future translational experiments and ventures. One of the experiments currently under planning consists of a study and assessment of the effects of circadian-enhanced lighting on the mood and circadian rhythms of children with autism. For this, we have begun arrangements with the Groden Center in Providence, RI, who are experts in the treatment of children with autism. A one-year funding extension for this NSF grant has been requested to help support this study.

This project will result in a sintering approach and processing conditions to obtain consistent and robust WC/Co materials with full densities and a uniform WC platelet microstructure simultaneously. These WC/Co materials with nano-WC platelets have the unique feature of thin WC platelets with high aspect ratios. This feature provides unprecedented enhancements in both hardness and toughness with properties better than any WC/Co materials known today. Such unmatched enhancements are achieved because thin thickness of nano-WC platelets offers high hardness, while the high aspect ratio provides superior toughness. In addition to the superior mechanical properties, this project also addresses the cost of WC/Co materials through our patented Integrated Mechanical and Thermal Activation (IMTA) process to make low cost nano-WC/Co powders as the starting materials to fabricate WC/Co materials with nano-WC platelets. This IMTA process combines mechanical and thermal activation to reduce processing steps, lower reaction temperatures, shorten reaction times, decrease ball milling times, and thus drastically reduce the cost of the nano-WC/Co powder. Currently, the roadblock to the anticipated potentials is inhomogeneous microstructure and a large variation in hardness and toughness. Thus, this PFI: AIR Technology Translation project will focus on sintering study and establish sintering conditions to attain consistent WC/Co materials with compositions ranging from 6 to 18 wt.% Co in conjunction with full densities and a uniform WC platelet microstructure simultaneously.

The project engages Kennametal, the second largest WC/Co manufacturer in the world, to independently evaluate the mechanical properties of the WC/Co materials with nano-WC platelets with a goal to accelerate technology translation from research discovery toward commercial reality. In addition, the project team works with University Technology Park (UTP) at Illinois Institute of Technology. UTP is one of the nation's fastest-growing hubs for high-tech innovation, and has a robust network of venture capital firms and angel investors. Working with UTP offers the project team with the option of creating a startup company with funds from venture capital firms or angel investors as well as office space and laboratories required by a new startup company.

The WC/Co materials with nano-WC platelets are important because WC/Co materials make up of 98% of all hardmetal components and have been widely used in military, aerospace, automotive, marine, petrochemical, mining, electronics, and wood industries. In all of these military and civilian applications, superior wear resistance derived from a combination of high hardness and high toughness is required. In some cases, impact resistance is also a must. Therefore, advanced WC/Co materials with simultaneous improvements in hardness and toughness will greatly enhance the performance of many existing WC/Co components, and open up new opportunities in areas outside their current application windows. The low cost manufacturing that we have developed can further propel widespread applications of such novel WC/Co hardmetals, and enhance the US manufacturing competitiveness.",,,"The major goals of this PFI: AIR-TT project are to (i) investigate the synthesis conditions of pure WC-10 wt% Co and WC-13 wt% Co nanopowders without impurities or excess carbon through a novel manufacturing process, termed as the Integrated Mechanical and Thermal Activation (IMTA) process, developed in a previous NSF project, (ii) identify sintering conditions to obtain consistent WC-Co materials with 10 wt.% Co, 13 wt.% Co, and 18 wt.% Co compositions in conjunction with full densities and a uniform WC platelet microstructure simultaneously, (iii) prove that these densified WC-Co bodies have superior mechanical properties with simultaneous enhancements in hardness and toughness over those available in the marketplace currently, and (iv) establish a clear pathway for commercialization of the inventive WC-Co technology.

This NSF-sponsored project has led to the following technical accomplishments. (i) The IMTA synthesis conditions of WC-10 wt% Co and WC-13 wt% Co nanopowders were thoroughly investigated and several conditions in making pure WC-10 wt% Co and WC-13 wt% Co nanopowders without impurities or excess carbon were established. (ii) Pressureless sintering to convert WC-10 wt% Co and WC-13 wt% Co nanopowders to solid blocks was studied. Several challenges including distorted disc shape and the presence of amorphous carbon in the sintered discs were identified. Solutions to these problems have been found. (iii) Spark plasma sintering was investigated as well and found to be more effective than pressureless sintering in densifying WC-Co nanopowders. (iv) It is found that there are a wide range of solid-state sintering temperatures that can result in the formation of WC platelet microstructure from WC-Co nanopowders (see Figure 1 for the WC platelet microstructure derived from WC-Co nanopowder). (v) WC-Co bodies with WC platelet microstructure exhibit simultaneous enhancements in both hardness and toughness. The thin thickness of WC platelets offers high hardness, while the high aspect ratio of WC platelets provides superior toughness. (vi) The simultaneous enhancements in both hardness and toughness have been achieved with WC-10 wt% Co, WC-13 wt% Co, and WC-18 wt% Co, indicating that the strategy of forming WC platelet microstructure is applicable to a wide range of WC-Co compositions.

This research has offered training and education opportunities to one postdoctoral fellow (Dr. Satya Emani), one graduate student (Vincent Ding), and two REU students (Tyler Seppala and Jierui Sha). Furthermore, this research has been incorporated into a semester long IPRO (Interprofessional Project) at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) that has allowed 8 undergraduate students to learn research, team collaboration, marketing, and commercialization of new technology. The title of the IPRO project is ""Tungsten Carbide-Cobalt Nanomaterial Research &amp; Industry Application Studies"". The IPRO project is co-instructed by the PI Shaw (Materials Engineering) and the Co-PI Anderson (IIT Technology Transfer Office). Figure 2 shows the picture of this IPRO project team that has won the IPRO Technology Innovation Award with a cash prize of $1,000 on the IPRO Day at IIT.

Partnership with two industrial partners, Kennametal and Molex, has been established with a common goal to translate the novel WC-Co technology from laboratory discovery to marketplace. Kennametal and Molex have different businesses with respect to WC-Co materials. Kennametal is the largest manufacturer of WC-Co powders, sintered WC-Co blocks, and WC-Co tools in the United States and provides these products to various WC-Co users. In contrast, Molex is a leading manufacturer and supplier of electronic, electrical and fiber optic interconnection systems with multi-billion business worldwide and uses WC-Co tools to make these products. Monthly teleconferences with both Kennametal and Molex to provide them with technical update, receive feedback from them, and discuss commercialization pathways have been on-going for several months. It is expected that agreements on technology transfer, commercialization pathways, and licensing revenue can be completed in next several months.

GLP-1 reduces blood glucose after eating by interactions with its receptor (GLP-1R) that signal increased insulin secretion, reduced glucagon secretion, slowed gastric emptying and increased satiety. GLP-1R agonists provide, arguably, the most effective therapeutic approach for achieving recommended blood-glucose targets in the management of T2D. However, the currently available GLP-1R agonists, exenatide and liraglutide, suffer the drawback, especially for chronic medication, of requiring injection. The goal is to develop a solid-dose formulation of a GLP-1 analog that combines convenience of oral administration with the therapeutic advantages.  The digestion of peptide hormones via oral delivery is challenged by gastrointestinal (GI) proteases and the absorption barrier of the GI tract. In addition, the active lifetime of GLP-1 is greatly shortened by proteolytic degradation as a result of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in the blood and tissues. The early-stage technology-oriented research of this project starts with the discovery by Dr. Bachovchin and co-workers of how to make GLP-1 more resistant to destruction by GI proteases, DPP4, and NEP. A combination of peptide chemistry and formulation in enteric-coated tablets will be used to achieve the oral bioavailability and glucose-lowering potency required for clinical use. The methods are also applicable to other peptide hormones of possible therapeutic interest. In this vein, the Bachovchin team has modified the appetite-suppressing peptide oxyntomodulin to provide resistance to DPP4 and NEP without disruption of the receptor-agonist activity required for homeostatic function. 

The broader impacts of this project lie in its contribution to the solution of a large, costly public health problem. More than half of T2D patients fail to achieve recommended targets for glycemic control, leading to high rates of medical complications. The problem will grow as the number of diabetics rises to an estimated 300 million in 2025. The American Diabetes Association-European Association for the Study of Diabetes consensus recognizes GLP-1 analogs as potentially the most effective treatment; but market penetration suggests only a minority of patients currently receive their benefit. Avoidance of injections reduces prescription of exenatide and liraglutide. Development of a GLP-1 analog in convenient oral formulation would overcome this hurdle and in combination with lifestyle changes might help to slow or prevent disease progression in the increasing numbers of juvenile patients and prediabetics, who, because they are asymptomatic, are less likely to accept long-term injections. For Unigene Laboratories, Inc., the advances anticipated in the course of this project will further validate the versatility of the Peptelligence (TM) platform for solid-dose formulation of peptide-based drugs for oral delivery, and in turn increase its marketability as a service. For Arisaph and Unigene, given success, a drug candidate will result that could be clinically developed and eventually commercialized by research and development conducted in partnership.


Partners at the inception of the project are 1) Lead Institution: Tufts University School of Medicine (Department of Biochemistry); and 2) Primary Small Business Partners: Unigene Laboratories Inc.(Boonton, NJ) and Arisaph Pharmaceuticals (Boston, MA).",,,"Introduction. In response to dietary glucose, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by the intestine and interacts with the receptor (GLP-1R) to generate molecular signals that increase insulin secretion, reduce glucagon secretion, slow gastric emptying, and increase satiety. The physiological net effect of GLP-1 is to reduce blood glucose levels. Exenatide and liraglutide are injectable analogs of GLP-1 that have been approved by the FDA for the pharmacological control of blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The goal of the PFI:BIC project was to develop a solid-dose formulation of a new orally active  GLP-1 analog that would combine the convenience of oral administration with the therapeutic efficacy of the injectable analogs.

Development of GLP-1 analogs that are intrinsically resistant to enzymatic degradation and orally active. Oral delivery of GLP-1 is challenged by the absorption barrier of the GI tract and susceptibility to digestion by gastrointestinal (GI) enzymes, In addition, once absorbed, the active lifetime of GLP-1 is greatly shortened due to digestion by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). GLP-1 is a 30 amino acid peptide. A synthetic analog of GLP-1 called ARI-1732 was made by incorporating a single amino acid change and addition of a nine amino acid segment of the Gila monster peptide, exendin-4, at the carboxy terminus. The single amino acid substitution and the exendin-4 segment provided resistance to digestion by DPP4 and NEP, respectively. ARI-1732 was modified to produce a second GLP-1 analog (ARI-1732TS) in which two lysine residues present in native GLP-1 were modified by addition of biotin. The modification provided resistance to digestion by trypsin, which is a digestive system enzyme that would destroy orally delivered GLP-1 prior to absorption. Both ARI-1732 and ARI-1732TS were found to activate the GLP-1R with similar efficiency to native GLP-1 in a cell culture system. In mice, co-administration of ARI-1732TS, a gastric acid neutralizer and the Bowman-Birk inhibitor of GI enzymes significantly reduced the elevation of blood glucose concentration in response to oral administration of glucose. Sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]caprylate (SNAC) is a small molecule that promotes the transcellular absorption of large biomolecules in the intestine. Addition of SNAC to the gastric acid neutralizer and the Bowman-Birk inhibitor further increased the glucose-lowering potency of ARI-1732TS in mice challenged with oral glucose. Measurements of the blood concentrations of ARI-1732TS in the mice indicated that bioavailability (i.e., the fraction of administered ARI-1732TS that reached the blood) was 0.05% without SNAC and 0.1% with its addition.

Selection of excipients that optimize GI absorption of GLP-1 analogs. ARI-1732 and ARI-1732TS were formulated with lauroyl-L-carnitine and a citrate buffer, excipients that can, respectively, enhance GI permeation and increase the acidity of intestinal fluids so as to reduce the activity of enzymes that digest peptides. Liquid formulations of the GLP-1 analogs containing various excipient concentrations were administered to rats by intraduodenal delivery, a surgical procedure that mimics the release and absorption that would be expected from a GLP-1 analog formulated in an enteric-coated tablet or capsule. Enteric coating provides a polymer barrier that protects the drug cargo of a tablet/capsule from the acidity of the stomach but is dissolved under the alkaline conditions of the small intestine to release the drug. Measurement of GLP-1 analog concentrations in the blood of rats following intraduodenal delivery of ARI-1732TS and ARI-1732 formulated with optimal concentrations of excipients demonstrated bioavailabilities of  5 and 8 percent, respectively.

Potential applications of this research platform on multilayer film capacitors will include smaller capacitors with high efficiencies, pulsed power electronics, dc-link capacitors for hybrid electric vehicles, grid-tie inverters and converters, and many others. 

The broader impacts of this research include the following: First, this project will serve as a university model for translating knowledge and technology to market-valued solutions.  If successful, the project will have a direct impact on the local and national economy by crystallizing cutting edge technology in Northeast Ohio for U.S. polymer dielectric film production and capacitors.

An inverter is needed to produce the necessary AC. However, inverters in existing power electronics units utilize a large volume of polymer film capacitors, known as DC-link capacitors, which cost nearly half of the entire price of the power electronics unit. Meanwhile, the capacitor lifetime is limited at 85 &deg;C, requiring an extra cooling system that adds more to the weight, cost, and energy consumption. To solve this problem, high temperature, high energy, and low loss dielectric polymer films are desired.

The focus of this Partnership for Innovation (PFI) project is to develop high temperature, high energy density, and low loss polymer film capacitors for electric vehicle applications based on the polymer multilayer film technology developed at Case Western Reserve University. These multilayer films consist of alternating layers of two different polymers, polycarbonate (PC) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The multilayered structure can provide high energy density, low dielectric loss, and high temperature tolerance simultaneously.

The most important outcome of this project is the development and prototype-level production of the multilayer film capacitors. A polymer multilayer film manufacturing line has been set up, knowledge and best practices are developed, and people are trained, enabling two start-up companies, PolymerPlus, LLC, and Orbital Research, Inc., to manufacture capacitor-grade multilayer films, metallize and wind them into film capacitor prototypes. This learning experience has led to an external funding from the Department of Energy, Vehicle Technology Office.

Intellectual Merit: On the research side at Case Western Reserve University, the best formulation for the highest energy density capacitor film is determined through dielectric studies: a volume ratio of 70/30 for PC to PVDF with a total film thickness of 5-10 microns. The best electrode metal for high temperature and high field is determined to be aluminum. Meanwhile, the knowledge and new design of instrumentation to perform reliable dielectric testing of dielectric polymer films at high temperatures under high electric fields have been developed. This PFI project has laid the foundation for a methodical study of high temperature polymer capacitor films.

Broader impacts: The knowledge-enhanced partnership model has been established among Case Western Reserve University, PoymerPlus, and Orbital Research. Several PhD, MSc, undergraduate students, and research associate have been trained in both academic and industrial environments. This brings together the gap between academic institutions and industry, and is instrumental in accelerating technology transfer. Also, four high school students participated in the project, gaining exposure to scientific research to stimulate their interest in the STEM fields.

Box 876011,Tempe,AZ,85287-6011,Tempe,US,9	0,"This Partnership for Innovation project from Arizona State University is aimed at developing a new approach to digital system design in order to significantly reduce the power consumption and size of digital systems without reducing their speed of operation. If successful, the results of this research can be used to improve the energy efficiency of nearly every digital system, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, cell phones and other handheld digital devices. This new approach employs threshold logic gates, which compute logic functions in a manner that is distinctly different from the way conventional logic gates operate. A threshold logic gate implements a complex logic function in a single primitive cell, which would otherwise require a network of many conventional logic gates. It is this absorption of logic into a single cell that is the reason for the reduction in power and size. A novel architecture for a threshold logic gate, called a differential threshold logic latch (DTLL), is proposed as the primitive logic cell.
DTLL cells are compatible with existing logic gates, and can be used to replace parts of a digital circuit to reduce its power and area and possibly improve its speed. The resulting circuit will be a hybrid, consisting of DTLL cells and conventional logic gates. A significant advantage of the proposed approach is that DTLL cells can be implemented as efficiently as standard cells, making it possible to integrate threshold logic technology with existing Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) design methodology. To enable the integration of threshold logic with conventional ASIC design requires the development of design infrastructure, which includes the design of a threshold cell library, and a host of algorithms and software tools that transform existing digital designs into hybrid designs. This project will build such an infrastructure.

The broader impacts of the project will be benefits to performance of mobile electronic applications such as smart phones, cameras, laptops, etc. These devices will benefit the most from a reduction in power consumption delivered as a result of this project. A fundamental advantage of the approach taken in this project to reducing power consumption is that the technology of threshold logic is compatible with existing logic. As a result, the proposed approach is fully compatible with existing industrial design methodology. No new fabrication technology will be required, and existing commercial back-end design tools (e.g., synthesis, optimization, placement and routing) can be used for the hybrid netlists.

It is based on an alternate method of computing logic functions, that is seamlessly integrated into existing design methodologies. The approach includes three innovations: (1) a patented design of a digital circuit architecture that implements a new type of logic primitives (TLG); (2) patented design of a novel standard cell library of TLGs, which is compatible with conventional cell libraries used by commercial synthesis, optimization and physical design tools; and (3) patented algorithms that optimize a logic network for power using using a combination of conventional logic gates and TLGs. The approach has been demonstrated on large function blocks using state-of-the-art commercial design tools: the results showed a 25%-35% reduction in dynamic power, 20%-40% reduction in leakage, and a 10% - 25% reduction in area, all without sacrificing performance. The effort resulted in 11 patent applications (7 issued and 4 pending).
Broader Impact: The technology has the potential to substantially improve the power consumption of any ASIC, and therefore, all digital microelectronic systems &ndash; smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearable devices, desktops, servers, and numerous others. A conservative estimate of 25%-30% reduction in power without a performance loss (achieved by design alone) is quite good as it equals what can be achieved in a typical transition to a new technology node. The reduction in cost alone, not to mention the improvement in energy savings, would most certainly increase the profitability of US fabless design companies, and contribute to the overall economic competitiveness of the US. The PFI-BIC project supported one male and one female Ph.D student, and through REUs, two undergraduate students. The project also resulted in the formation of a startup that is pursuing the commercialization of the technology. The startup has received a exclusive license from ASU to all the IP resulting from this funding.  The technology is under evaluation with a major semiconductor company.  
The customers are semiconductor design companies designing integrated circuits for the Internet of Things (IoT), wearables and microcontroller markets. 
The main value proposition is shifting the Performance-Power-Area trade-off curve. Using Sygnal technology, customers will be able to decrease the power consumption of their designs by up to 30% while maintaining the same clock speed and decreasing area by up to 30% at the same time (see attached Figure). This will lead to increased revenues for them in markets where power consumption is the key specification. Moreover, integrated circuits using Sygnal technology will enable IoT devices that are not feasible with today?s state-of-the-art design technology.

 A partnership between researchers and product developers from several industrial and academic institutions has been assembled to tackle a long-standing problem of detecting, in living cells, the structure of molecular associations of membrane proteins. Capitalizing on microscopy technology for multi-color analysis of microscopic images of cells, originally dxeveloped at UW-Milwaukee, an Open Forum for Innovation (OFI) was established to develop and guide proof-of-concept experiments in several areas related to SR-TPM technology development and applications: (a) high-spectral resolution and high-acquisition speed imaging scanners, (b) fiber laser alternatives to current solid-state lasers used for two-photon microscopy, and (c) novel biomarkers and labeled antibodies for detecting transient interactions between proteins in vivo, and developing living cell assays for cell signaling pathways to be used for drug screening.

To detect interactions between receptor proteins or between them and their ligands, a special exchange of energy is used&mdash;F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&mdash;that occurs when two fluorescent molecules, each attached to a protein of interest, come within a nanometer of each other. As a result of FRET, a laser-excited molecule, called a donor, transfers its energy to a nearby molecule, called the acceptor, which causes the acceptor to emit light. If the donor, which normally fluoresces green, is excited by laser light, but yellow is emitted by the acceptor, one knows that FRET occurred, and that the two proteins have interacted. The necessary color information is detected with exquisitely high-resolution with a laser-scanning microscope in which the spectrum of colors originating from a cellular sample containing the proteins of interest is projected by diffractive optics onto a fast and extremely sensitive camera.

The partnership was formalized through establishment of a UWM-Small Businesses Collaboratory (http://www4.uwm.edu/collaboratory/index.cfm),
of which both industrial and academic partners are active members. The whole body met twice for the duration of the grant in two-day symposia (http://www4.uwm.edu/letsci/conferences/microspectroscopy2013/)
to review the state of the art of the technology and its applications in research, identify new directions of research and product-development opportunities, and establish smaller teams of investigators to pursue specific research projects. The research teams met and communicated as necessary for the duration of the entire projects.


Broader impacts

The new technology allows biomedical researchers to investigate cellular signaling under normal and pathological conditions, which holds the key to development and application of novel diagnostic assays and drugs to target specific diseases. In addition, the partnership between private industry and university researchers stimulates development of new intellectual property that can be quickly brought to market. This expands U.S. presence in in an area of technology development currently dominated by international companies (Zeiss, Nikon, Leica and Olympus).

No other known technology has yet succeeded in detecting from measurements in living cells the spatial arrangement of proteins within a macromolecular complex (i.e., the quaternary structure of proteins). With further developments of this technology, it should also become possible to visualize in real time association and dissociation of proteins at their cellular location. Whenever a new technology allows one to visualize a biological process for the first time, it often leads to interesting and apriori unanticipated insights.

SUNY Albany (College of Nanoscale Science & Engineering (CNSE)), in collaboration with key players from the private sector and government,  focuses on the area of silicon nanowire (SiNW)-related nanotechnology innovations and discoveries to optimize the properties of energy devices through the integration of SiNW materials with controlled interfaces and desired physical and chemical properties that will allow more widespread implementation of this platform technology.  CNSE's unique fabrication capabilities of nanostructured materials will enable the production of interface geometries, defect structures, and atomic arrangements not otherwise possible in materials produced by traditional methods.  In turn, the investigation of carrier generation, charge distribution, surface migration and charge transfer on uniquely tailored surfaces leading to better understanding and processing of these materials will be enabled.  Additionally, new shared knowledge will determine how to best integrate one- and three-dimensional Si-based nanostructures and how such processes can be appropriately scaled economically.

The broader impacts of this research are on energy efficiency and clean energy technology.  The project proffers advances in energy devices, including solar cells, thermoelectric devices, and batteries through improvements in SiNW architectures and nanostructured materials.  This activity will build on the work of CNSE's broader incubation, commercialization, and ""partnerships for innovation"" efforts; which focus on connecting university-based research and development activities with private enterprise funding and expertise, which, in turn, will help increase the rate and scale of clean energy technology market penetration across the region and country. This program is expected to develop and ultimately commercialize innovations and create economic development opportunities, resulting in green jobs in the U.S., as well as ensuring independent and secure energy resources for the nation.  In addition to technology development outcomes of this project, for the first time, three small business industrial partners at CNSE will get to experience and contribute to the power of leveraging the circular open innovation model.  The knowledge sharing within this technology platform will result in a pipeline of new capacity with new and existing industry partners.  This approach will make CNSE's new technology capabilities openly accessible to external users, allowing these outsiders to expand on and remix the core product in surprising new ways.  Anticipated to arise out of input from external users will be improvement on the innovations and creation of new value that CNSE and its partners may ultimately be able to use in other industry segments.

The challenge in incorporating nanotechnology in clean energy applications is to effectively utilize existing knowledge of science that predicts behavior, measures characteristics at the nanoscale; and understand, design and integrate nanomaterials through a scalable production process. In addition, new knowledge can determine how to best integrate one- and three -dimensional nanostructures and how such processes can be appropriately scaled ""economically"".

Project Outcomes:

YEAR I

The approach and      reactor design allowed precise control on the process stability, reproducibility,      and purity of SiNWs for larger area samples compared to the smaller size      reactor used for the research project.
In addition, it was      found that different thicknesses of catalyst layer leads to different SiNW      morphologies, leading to a proposal that the Ni is consumed from the      bottom layer and not the catalyst tip.
It was found that      the oxidation of nickel and the reduction of silicon plays a vital role in      the cycling performance of the SiNWs.
The team has shown that SiNWs grown with the VLS mechanism on      stainless substrates to be used as electrode in Li-ion batteries could      make this system very promising for future batteries.


YEAR II

NSF PFI: NICE-IP developed the      VLS approach to grow SiNWs to allow better control on the process      stability, reproducibility, and purity of SiNWs on the larger area samples      compared to the smaller size reactor used for the research project.
For the solar cell      devices, Au was selected as the catalyst of choice for the SiNWs      development on Si substrates. Several solar p-i-n devices with i-SiNWs      were fabricated and tested. For the battery technology, the use of Ni as      catalyst on stainless substrates was further developed.  It was found that the oxidation of      nickel and the reduction of silicon plays a vital role in the cycling      performance of the SiNWs.
The novelty of the      solar devices fabricated is that the n-type emitter was fabricated by      spin-on and diffusion process. A low cost process, which is used in by the      solar cell industry as standard process for the development of high      efficiency and lower cost crystalline silicon devices, has the potential      to be used with SiNWs based solar devices and can be expanded in large      area cells.
The electrical      characteristics of the devices with i-SiNWs were found to be: Isc=4.1mA,      Voc=225mV, FF=24% with efficiency (n) n&lt; 1%. Fabrication 2x SINW      devices on top of p-n crystalline silicon devices could potentially lead      to higher efficiency crystalline Si devices.
The VLS process,      with Ni catalyst on stainless steel substrate, resulted with SiNWs which      consisted of an amorphous NixSiyOz shell and a NiSi polycryst...",STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK

Kenaf is selected because of its ability to grow in arid conditions, where alternative plantings cannot be considered. From an engineering standpoint, it represents a domestic resource that has the same strength to weight ratio as glass fiber. Natural fibers in their as-harvested state have a porous structure that is often destroyed by the industrial processing through alkali treatment.  Approaches based on placing the freshly harvested crop in river or pond water are not effective on a large scale. An alternative approach using bacteria based on selectivity for kenaf will be utilized through an academic-farmer partnership. The goal will be to develop technologically viable reinforcements that retain their natural features while reducing the environmental footprint associated with their processing. 
 
The broader impacts from this research arise from the interdisciplinary partnership at all levels of the PFI. A successful effort could yield positive economic, environmental, and energy savings for both residential and commercial buildings, while meeting or exceeding the industrial standards. The platform of new multifunctional materials also has potential applications for commercially viable sustainable building products in many sectors (e.g., aerospace, packaging, and transportation). Efforts to integrate fiber process modifications will translate to job creation in rural segments with value-added markets improving the investment returns. The work is inherently interdisciplinary-- incorporating a variety of areas of engineering (biochemical, green, mechanical, and structural) and life cycle analysis--and through small-group interactive processes, promotes the direct involvement of graduate students early in the innovation value chain. Innovative academic-industrial research activities will be integrated with socially responsible entrepreneurship training, where doctoral students in each department will work together as an interdisciplinary Venture team, merging business and engineering innovation with sustainability concepts.

The project was divided into a 4 aspects:

1)     Harvesting fiber that could be used as a glass fiber substitute for fiberglass paired with a farming group

2)     Conversion of the fiber into a usable engineering constituent through high throughput processes

3)     Forming composite sheets that could be stand alone as well as skins of sandwich structures

4)     Forming foams that could be insulative but zero VOC or lower carbon footprint materials that could be stand alone or used as the core of sandwich composites

5)     Run simulations in the zero net energy lab and establish impact on energy consumption as building materials

 The project successfully completed the technology development. A model home was built in the final year and the projected carbon footprint was lowered as well as energy footprint by 50 and 25% respectively.

Intellectual merits:

A transformative high throughput process that is of zero ecological and environmental harm using bacteria harvested from flower beds was developed for the processing of green plant material into engineering constituents for products. New manufacturing approaches for increased insulation performance and use of plant stem material was developed that can be translated into industry with no change to equipment being used. The sandwich materials were successful in strength, insulation efficiency and performance. While the metrics of the new material met the targets of the industry partner, the general consensus is that new materials require municipal codes and building codes to be met leading to limited potential for translation into the building industry. A better use would be in indoor applications.

Broader impacts:

The information was disseminated in 6 journal publications, 6 conference proceedings, 1 book chapter, 3 MS thesis and 2 doctoral thesis.  International collaborations in Brazil and Uganda  were fostered. The research was incorporated into extensive dissemination globally through the Bioenvironmental Polymer Society. The composite and foam that used plant material is useful for myriad applications and we anticipate continued impact in industry use over the next few years. Undergraduate teams are engaged in entrepreneurial competitions harnessing the outcomes of this project for the future.

This project addresses the need to stimulate interest in the field of sensor technology.  Sensor technology engineering is a field ready for rapid growth and innovation, but the high level of specialization needed for a student to get into the field means that there are few students in the pipeline.  Sensor-related technology provides an exciting platform for developing an entrepreneurial-learning environment, and can have far reaching multidisciplinary implications. Combining students from both Stony Brook and Princeton in E-Teams, the approach taken in this project to entrepreneurial learning builds on both institutions' technical strengths in sensing and detection in general, their and in spectroscopic sensing in particular, and will support expansion of the sensor research community drawing, recruitment of undergraduate students into engineering, and enrichment of undergraduate training with multidisciplinary team-work experience and entrepreneurial skills. The project seeks to provide an educational model that will produce well-rounded engineers who are adaptable to the business world and who are capable of thriving in the face of new challenges.

Sensor technologies have been undergoing rapid transitions as is a result of a convergence of forces in along several dimensions, including miniaturization, intelligence and mobility.  Sensor technologies are poised to be applied in the real world in various applications such as environment and civil, industry and commerce, health, safety, and security.  Moreover, the area of sensor systems can provide a far-reaching, multidisciplinary technology ""pull"" that can fascinate and inspire engineering students.  The project seeks to contribute to the sensor revolution by building a technology workforce, a pipeline of engineering graduates with entrepreneurial and business skills.  At the same time, it will serve to revitalize engineering education with an integrated, systematic and multidisciplinary approach.  The coursework developed in this project is applicable elsewhere in the U.S., where sensor technology is important, e.g.,especially, Florida and California.  The methodology (e-teams, web based courses, entrepreneurship training) is widely useful in other engineering disciplines.

First, if successful, it will provide a new class of materials to meet needs for diesel emission, impacting the transportation industry.  The global market of heavy duty diesel catalysts for on-road trucks is projected to reach $2.6 billion in 2020. The product and technology are expected to help the US sustain its leadership in the field of low-temperature emission control, supporting a cleaner environment, through reduced use of certain metals, and enhancing economic competitiveness through export opportunities. The integration of research and product development demonstrated in this university-industry partnership program will form an important model and foundation to help pursue a sustained industrial-university research collaboration ecosystem. The broad application of this new technology is expected to produce new jobs and significant economic impact. An important outcome of this partnership project is the intensive training of students through the organic integration of academic research, technology transfer, and entrepreneurship. The team plans to use this unique partnership model to build a pipeline to demonstrate to student and postdoctoral researchers, especially women and under-represented groups, how frontier research can be directly transferred to industry for commercialization.

The proposed project intends to develop a high-efficiency, durable, and low-cost multifunctional adsorbers for low temperature and cold-start diesel emission control. Such multifunctional adsorbers combine the functions of low temperature nanoarray diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and low temperature adsorbers (LTA), forming a total solution at temperatures as low as 100 degrees Celsius. However, the DOCs that can work efficiently at temperatures below 200 degrees Celsius are not available in the current market, and are in urgent demand. In this project, surrounding the proposed university-industry partnership, the team will integrate the nanoarray DOCs with LTAs as a new class of multifunctional adsorbers. Scalable continuous hydrothermal and other processes at temperatures below 200 degrees Celsius will be used to enable the cost-effective fabrication of large scale stable multilayer adsorbers. The full-size adsorbers will be processed and validated for emission control through both lab and simulated field tests, with high catalytic activity at low temperature, robustness, and low materials usage.

The market of the microcontroller-based devices has been rapidly growing and expected to continue, thanks to recent trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, smart buildings, mobile robots, drones, etc. This market has been seeking microcontroller hardware that consumes very little power to extend the battery life. This market also has been seeking to increase computing capability to meet the growing need of complex workloads, such as a neural network algorithm, without much-increasing power consumption. However, since they were first developed multiple decades ago, microcontrollers have undergone rather incremental improvements and cannot support those emerging needs. The proposed technology, if successful, will create next-generation microcontroller hardware to achieve significantly higher performance, power-efficiency, and robustness, thereby supporting this critical market demand and posing a strong value proposition. 

The proposed project will further develop several recent NSF-funded research results.  The near- and sub-threshold voltage (NTV, STV) techniques, where the supply voltage is scaled down to a half to a quarter of the nominal level, has been considered one of the most effective ways to reduce power consumption. However, this approach has not been widely accepted because the hardware quickly loses robustness across operating conditions (temperature), manufacturing process variations, and long-term device aging. This problem becomes even worse with non-Von-Neumann hardware accelerators and analog-mixed-signal building blocks in the microcontroller system-on-chip. This project's objective is to create and commercialize the technologies that can effectively address the robustness challenge and thus achieve one to two orders of magnitude better power-efficiency and performance. The proposed effort in this project will be centered on creating power/area-efficient in-situ error detection and correction circuits (EDAC) and on-chip integrated digital voltage regulators and DC-DC converters that are applicable for commercial microcontrollers, non-Von-Neumann neural-network accelerators, and analog-mixed-signal building blocks. The anticipated result of the project is the silicon prototype of the next-generation microcontroller hardware integrating the developed technologies, demonstrating largely improved performance, power, and robustness.

This project will re-invent a novel, automated, game-based technology that can be used for routine cognitive assessment of older individuals who are at a high risk of developing AD. This technology-enabled method will significantly lower the cost associated with cognitive assessment and enable objective and accurate measurements of one's cognitive status, which will lead to early detection of cognitive declines associated with MCI and AD.

This innovative system employs a set of highly instrumented cubes interfacing with computerized games. The cubes feature programmable visual, auditory, and tactile sensory feedback mechanisms and embedded motion sensors for user performance and behavior assessment via interactive play. The games will be designed to capture working memory, spatial reasoning, response time, and hand-eye coordination skills tailored for the target population. The integrated computational measures of play complexity will enable the system to automatic adjust the game difficulty based on the user performance. The system will not only automate the administration and data collection process, but also produce new types of behavioral data, such as hand tremor, repetitive or hyperactive motions, and manipulation speed.

These industries are increasingly dealing with fine powders, desirable because they improve product performance. Unfortunately, fine powder-based products pose significant difficulties in manufacturing and cause product failures due to their intrinsic poor processability and tendency to form large lumps. The innovation comes through scientific understanding of why fine powders behave poorly, and determining how their surfaces could be modified via novel mechanical processes to drastically and predictively improve their behavior.  Significant commercial impact is expected from shorter drug product development times and reduced pharmaceutical product failures, as well as from increased profits in manufacturing tablet-based drug products. Societal impact comes from making available higher quality medicines to patients at lower costs. It will have a positive impact on the professional development of students participating in the project, through training in cutting-edge research, innovation and entrepreneurship. In addition, the proposed science teacher training will impact K-12 participants from school districts with large underrepresented minority populations. 

The proposed project will fundamentally advance understanding of how fine powders behave and why they lead to significant manufacturing challenges. The Intellectual merit of the project stems from physics-based models explaining why fine smooth particles, as well as rough particles (less than third the diameter of human hair), flow and pack poorly. However, when they are nano-rough, i.e., having surface asperities 500 times smaller than the diameter of human hair, they flow and pack significantly better. The understanding and development of mechanical processes to economically create nano-rough surfaces offer commercialization opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry. These include benefits from novel fine engineered drug powders flowing as well as those 5-10 times their size, and development of fine excipients that outperform their larger commercial counterparts in flow, packing, and tablet forming capability. The proposed novel advanced models should also help design the powders and their blends that form the building blocks of pharmaceutical products, such as tablets and capsules. If successful, these models will eliminate excessive time and material-consuming experimentation that increases manufacturing costs. Associated simulations will enable computer-assisted design of tablets, leading to better and cheaper drug products.  Additional intellectual merit of the project is through the participation of students with industry partners and mentors while engaging in research targeted for commercialization.

Early prototypes of this technology have transformed several remote towns by providing reliable, high-quality water on tap to over 83,000 people. The next generation of water treatment technologies are less complex than the highly mechanized systems that were developed in the last century. The new series of municipal-scale drinking water treatment processes relies on an advanced understanding of the interactions between particles, fluid, and flow to more efficiently remove pathogens and other contaminants. The process designs remove particles, pathogens, and some dissolved contaminants using special adhesive nanoparticles with the most energy efficient technologies currently available. The benefits to society will be ultra-low energy, resilient, hack-proof, high-performing water treatment infrastructure that can easily be operated without reliance on computers or mechanized systems. The proposed technology will substantially reduce the cost of maintaining and upgrading water treatment infrastructure and are expected to propel a new era of competition and innovation in the water treatment sector.

The proposed project will advance the understanding of particle, pathogen, and dissolved contaminant removal mechanisms. The core drinking water treatment technologies have largely stagnated in the past decades because the underlying mechanisms were not understood and it was necessary to rely on empirical designs. This created an opportunity to develop the science of the core drinking water treatment processes and then dramatically improve those designs. The proposed research and development will build on the recently developed hydraulic flocculation model and new insights into the dominant particle removal mechanism in upflow fluidized floc filters. The goal of the research is to use the new insights into the treatment processes to begin to optimize their design. A pilot scale facility using a surface water source will be configured to test: 1) new designs for the upflow fluidized floc filter (UFFF) inlet diffuser and jet reverser system, 2) the UFFF depth, 3) a more compact tube settler system, and 4) stacked rapid sand filter extraction system. Performance will be measured using particle counters, turbidimeters, a UV meter to measure dissolved organics, and a pathogen panel to measure pathogen removal efficiency.

Leakage in water pipelines is a major problem for many water utilities as it leads to significant economic losses and cause service disruptions threatening public safety. Most utilities currently use methods that can be expensive, time consuming, and require trained personnel. This project will perform proof-of-concept studies with two partner utilities to evaluate the commercialization potential of fast leakage detection software using routine pressure measurements.  If successful, this will transform the leakage detection industry by providing an operational tool for utilities that can detect leaks using pressure information collected as part of their day-to-day operations. If leaks can be identified early, utilities can fix them as part of planned maintenance operations rather than waiting for them to become major catastrophic water main breaks. This will not only result in significant cost and water savings but also reduce associated risks to public health and safety from major water main breaks. The project will train emerging professionals in entrepreneurial leadership through focused training with close interaction and mentoring from commercialization experts and business professionals.

The proposed project will evaluate the potential of commercializing fast leak detection methods previously developed by the project team by integrating these methods into an IoT (Internet of Things) platform and performing proof-of-concept studies with partner utilities. Most utilities currently employ intrusive methods based on acoustic or infrared signals. The leakage detection methods have been to be two to three orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than existing simulation-optimization methods for leakage detection using pressure. The major goals of this project are the following: (a) test and validate the leak detection approaches for real networks by conducting a series of proof-of-concept studies using artificially introduced leaks with two utilities, (b) working with an industrial partner, develop an IoT platform to seamlessly acquire data from multiple sources and facilitate execution of hydraulic model-based leak detection analytics in real time, (c) develop plans for commercialization of the IoT platform and the associated leak detection analytics, and (d) participate in entrepreneurial leadership and commercialization training.

The wine and grape industry is a multi-billion dollar industry which is heavily impacted by powdery mildew disease that reduces yield and product quality, resulting in an 'off' flavor. For grapes, powdery mildew treatment represents 75% of pesticide costs, and current treatment methods are becoming less effective. Every grape-bearing acre is treated numerous times in a growing season, typically with sulfur treatments interspersed with the use of systemic fungicides (chemicals that inhibit powdery mildew protein function). However, resistance to currently used fungicides is increasingly common and recent reports suggest that sulfur poses health risks. We are using a non-GMO approach called RNAi (RNA interference) which limits the production of specific powdery mildew chemicals in an environmentally friendly process.  In addition, the market for the proposed products will be further explored, and a detailed commercialization plan will be developed with active input from commercialization experts and industry stakeholders. Training in entrepreneurship of women and minorities is an important component of this project, which is led by women and will include women and minority Agriculture Innovation Undergraduate Interns.

The proposed project will address the pressing and widespread problem of powdery mildew disease of agriculture, focused on grapevine. Powdery mildew is a ubiquitous pathogen of grapevine that has a major impact on yield and product quality. The team developed a non-GMO RNAi approach to limit the function of specific powdery mildew genes and the means to screen for the targets that most efficiently result in decreased disease on plants. In this proposal, the team will screen for additional novel powdery mildew targets and perform field testing of at least one highly promising RNAi product. Novel powdery mildew targets can be readily identified using this approach and grapevine treatment with distinct RNAi products over the course of the growing season can provide a cost-effective and safer means of limiting powdery mildew disease.  RNAi products are biodegradable and highly specific with minimal off-targets, making them attractive as more environmentally benign than current treatments.  Intellectual property for the target identification process and efficacious powdery mildew targets will be secured.

If successful, this technology is expected to enable surgeons to seamlessly integrate tissue engineering materials in their current robotic surgery practice by developing a tool that prints tissue engineering constructs using existing robotic surgery instrumentation.  The tool will integrate with current robotic surgery infrastructure already installed at hundreds of research hospitals in the United States.

One of the world's most important crops, cotton enjoys many opportunities to participate in a competitively priced bio-based products industry. Increased durability and strength of cotton fiber offers the opportunity to replace synthetic fibers that require ~230 million barrels of petroleum per year to produce in the USA alone - but fiber quality improvement has been extremely slow. The team expects to accelerate fiber quality improvement by using chemically-induced mutants to bypass the lack of natural genetic variation in the cotton gene pool. The team anticipates addressing the long-standing problem where fiber quality increases at the cost of decreasing yield by identifying and separating the genetic factors causing this effect. Even a small improvement, leveraged over the ~$6 billion value of the US cotton crop alone with an estimated aggregate influence of ~$120 billion/yr on the US gross domestic product, represents a major commercialization opportunity.

The proposed project builds on the demonstration that we can obtain cotton mutants with useful improvements in fiber quality, and that assembly of multiple mutants results in highly superior lines. Here we broaden the pool of superior lines toward a 'pipeline', also determining the impact of these fiber quality traits on fiber yield, identify diagnostic DNA markers that can be used to expedite manipulation of these genes, and narrow the locations of the genes themselves to small intervals in the genome. This project will provide a test of the new hypothesis that genomic regions (quantitative trait loci, QTLs) that determine fiber quality include not merely single genes as long expected, but dozens of genes that function in coordination with one another -- and therefore that the inverse relationship between yield and fiber quality can be overcome by creating and identifying mutations in single genes that change quality traits with minimal disturbance to yield components.  The project will identify prototype cotton 'lines' that are of immediate potential commercial value, as well as a 'pipeline' of ongoing improvements, addressing the 'Red Queen' challenge that we will need to continue to increase our fiber quality as commercial standards rise.

The developed product of a hand-held, real-time imaging tool will have huge commercial value and widespread applications. The medical imaging industry will greatly benefit from these integration procedures and the associated cost reductions. Furthermore, the proposed method could be used to develop portable imaging and sensing devices for a wide range of applications such as hydration sensing, blood glucose monitoring, monitoring of healing wounds (including skin burns and irritations), and dental caries detection.

The proposed project is focused on developing a fully-integrated ultra-wideband millimeter-wave imaging system for the first time, where no high-frequency or high-power external signal is required for the operation of the transceiver. This will be realized by employing the synthetic ultra-wideband imaging approach, where several disjointed, adjacent imaging sub-bands are integrated to collectively form an ultra-wide imaging bandwidth. Each sub-band contains a transceiver which operates only within that specific sub-band. The sub-band transceivers will be integrated on a single chip using the monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) technology. The ultra-wide bandwidth of the proposed imager will result in significantly higher image resolutions compared to the state-of-the-art millimeter-wave imaging technology. This will enable the technology to be applied to biomedical setups, in particular skin imaging and skin cancer detection. The outcome of this proposal will be an affordable skin imaging device that visualizes tumor profiles over the depth of the skin with large histopathological-like contrasts.

Over the past decade, a biological research community has emerged utilizing specific noninvasive techniques for in vivo studies of biological tissue.  A measurement technique known as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) will have an impact on many fields, including functional brain imaging, stroke assessment, breast cancer screening, and premature infant brain monitoring.  Applying silicon manufacturing techniques to making these near-infrared (NIR) instruments presents a significant milestone toward wearable diagnostic tools providing precise data on tissue oxygenation, in a compact form similar to a typical pulse oximeter.

The proposed project presents a significant milestone in the development of point-of-care diagnostic tools.  The team was the first to demonstrate the promise of implementation of frequency domain tissue spectroscopy techniques in an unmodified commercial silicon fabrication process.  They propose a wearable device that implements advanced NIRS methods in a compact form factor by employing low-cost, solid-state optical devices and a system-on-chip (SoC) platform integrating complex signal processing circuitry, laser drivers, digitization, and wireless communication capability. Frequency domain SoC microsystems will play a significant role in development of scalable, wearable and bedside monitoring systems capable of operation over multiple wavelengths to measure absolute concentrations of several biological chromophores and, as proposed here, achieve selective depth sensitivity, which is currently not possible with continuous-wave NIRS systems that only measure intensity. In addition, miniaturization enables the realization of systems for concurrent measurement of multiple diagnostic modalities. The integration of on-chip wireless data transmission will enable the flexibility to observe tissue oxygenation while subjects are in motion without the limiting constraints of a bulky fiber optic cable harness.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.  Although the treatment of coronary artery disease - the cause of heart attacks - has progressed significantly in recent decades, the number of heart attacks and deaths is increasing, due primarily to the aging population.  The cost to the nation is staggering, presently over $300 billion per year, and increasing.  Better and more cost-effective diagnostic procedures and treatment options are urgently needed.  The objectives of this research are the development of an innovative, noninvasive, computer analysis procedure to precisely assess the risk of a heart attack occurring in an individual patient and the implementation of the procedure in a software product prototype.  Upon successful completion of the research, the industrial partner is committed to pursuing clinical trials, FDA approval, bringing the product to the clinic, and commercializing it.  This research will improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of coronary artery disease, thereby reducing cost, risk, unnecessary invasive procedures and, at the same time, producing better outcomes and quality of life.

The proposed project will address an insidious and heretofore unsolved problem in cardiovascular disease, so-called vulnerable plaques.  These are lipid pools in the wall of an artery, separated from the lumen by a thin, inflamed, fibrous cap, which upon rupture releases emboli into the blood stream, causing clot formation and blocking flow.  Vulnerable plaques are estimated to be the cause of approximately two-thirds of heart attacks, but heretofore their detection and composition could only be determined by invasive procedures.  Recent breakthroughs have presented the opportunity to segment vulnerable plaques from CT scans, and identify material constituents, including lipid and calcium content, and fibrous caps, from which patient-specific, computational models can be formulated.  These provide, for the first time, the opportunity to noninvasively analyze and study stress states prior to rupture and to perform rupture simulations under circumstances that have, and have not, led to rupture.  Risk stratification criteria describing the probability of rupture will be determined from these studies to provide physicians with guidelines for treatment protocols, such as stenting, bypass grafting, aggressive medical therapy, or standard medical therapy including statins, antihypertensives, and lifestyle modifications.

These applications are all crucial to societal function today.  For example, surveying the snow pack can be important for hydroelectric power and drinking water estimates.  Other important applications include mapping coastlines, as well as determining the health of agricultural crops and trees to predict yields as well as fire risks.   However, the mechanical-based LIDAR scanners currently used have a limited lifetime, are large, and power hungry.  This can cause significant constraints; for example, a drone can only carry a very limited and small system, or battery life will be impacted.   Nonmechanical scanning methods can offer a solution.  The research will demonstrate an innovative technique for nonmechanical scanning applied to LIDAR systems.

The proposed project focuses on an incoherent light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system, using nonmechanical beam steering with adaptive optical elements.   The system is compact, versatile, and ultra-low power.   It will enable a new generation of systems that are able to adapt with agility to changing conditions and targets.   Unlike conventional LIDAR systems which often use beam steering based on prisms or gimbals that rely on mechanically moving parts, which can be heavy, power hungry, and have a limited lifetime, the proposed LIDAR design has operational lifetime orders of magnitude longer due to nonmechanical components. The proposed work will enable new LIDAR technology with enhanced capabilities (ability to adapt to changing conditions) and steer the technology in a direction for eventual commercialization.

Plastics are a major component of many consumer products such as bottles, synthetic fibers, building materials, etc., and are currently made from petroleum resources. In recent years, many attempts have been made to produce ingredients for plastics from agricultural resources as a more sustainable feedstock. One technological challenge is the ability to handle the diversity of plant sources (grasses vs. hardwoods) as feedstocks to make consistent and compatible ingredients currently used in plastics. This work develops a technology to make plastic precursors from lignin derived from various sources, such as cellulosic ethanol plants or the pulp and paper industry. The proposed technology breaks down the lignin into smaller chemicals that are readily transformed into substances that can be used to make plastics. By demonstrating a modular technology concept, scale-up to industrial production rates is achieved by simply increasing the number of modules.

The proposed project will address the major challenge of developing practically viable technologies to make value added products from lignin for profitable biorefineries. Specific objectives are to demonstrate a scalable technology for converting lignin from various sources (alkaline, organosolv and milled lignin) to bio-based prepolymers suitable for making resins and plastics.   This is achieved by selective ozonolysis of the lignin solution (in acetic acid) in a spray reactor to partially break up the lignin into low molecular weight aromatics which are then grafted on to the macromolecular lignin structure by acidification with sulfuric acid in a stirred reactor.  This technology converts >95% of the lignin to prepolymers which are separated by filtration from the solvent which is recycled.  These two steps occur sequentially at mild operating conditions (ambient temperature and pressure) that favor process economics.  Process optimization to form prepolymers with desired properties will be guided by benchmarking with conventional phenol-formaldehyde and bakelite-type resins.  Process scalability will be demonstrated by operating multiple spray reactors in parallel followed by acidification of the combined ozonolysis product to generate prepolymers with identical properties and in sufficient quantities for product testing.

Commercial availability of LMBs would also represent an improvement for the electrified transportation and grid storage sectors because for a given size, these batteries offer 2 - 5 times more storage capacity than current state-of-the art lithium-ion technology. As a step towards driving commercial interest, this project will develop, evaluate, and demonstrate rechargeable lithium batteries in various sizes, and will explore their manufacturability and market entry requirements. 

The proposed project will develop cross-linked, ion-conducting polymer membranes that can be applied as interfacial coatings (interphases) on the metallic lithium anodes. It is known that the propensity of Li metal to form rough/dendritic deposits during battery recharge is a key barrier to commercialization of LMBs. During multiple charge-discharge cycles, the dendrites grow and proliferate throughout the inter-electrode space, ultimately causing catastrophic battery failure when they bridge the electrodes to short-circuit the battery. Research in the project will create cross-linked polymer coatings on Li electrodes, which preliminary studies by the Principal Investigator show provide multiple powerful strategies for arresting dendritic electrodeposition at both low and high ionic currents. At low currents, such interphases prevent dendrite formation by protecting Li metal against parasitic reactions with electrolyte components, which facilitates fast and uniform interfacial ion transport, enabling more uniform deposition. At high currents, cross-linked polymer interphases impart viscoelasticity to a liquid electrolyte, which prevent dendrite growth by arresting the hydrodynamic instability known as electroconvection. With the specific aim of creating scalable processes for fabricating dendrite-resistant, polymer-coated Li electrodes, the research proposed will investigate how changes in structure, mechanics, and transport properties induced by coating chemistry influence the reversibility of Li electrodeposition processes.

The project is expected to, for the first time, enable widespread use of advanced robotic technologies across more than 600,000 bridges in the U.S. and will also expand to the international civil infrastructure inspection market. 

The proposed project will advance the development of bridge inspection robots to automate the NDE data collection process and filter NDE data to enable accurate and reliable assessment of a bridge's condition. Research objectives include: development of hardware and software for NDE sensor-robot integration, non-contact acoustic array for fast inspections, NDE data processing algorithms for automated inspection and evaluation, and three-dimensional data visualization for seamless assessment of a bridge deck's condition. Extensive tests and deployment of the robotic platforms on bridges and other civil infrastructures will be conducted. If successful, the resulting integrated prototype will allow fast, accurate detection and evaluation of bridge conditions and will create a standard tool to enable wide and efficient use of NDE technologies to inspect other infrastructure. The project is expected to represent a major advancement within civil engineering and infrastructure maintenance.

This project will enhance the ability to efficiently machine highly engineered parts, solving a common costly and labor-intensive technical hurdle facing many industries including optics, additive or 3D manufacturing, and other sectors with highly demanding machining requirements.  This project will also create new and broader collaborations with industry, enhance partnerships between academia and industry, and build infrastructure for research and education. The proposed activities will provide next generation leaders in innovation and entrepreneurship with firsthand experience in technology development, translation, and commercialization. In addition, this work will expand the participation of women and students from underrepresented groups in innovation, technology translation, and entrepreneurship.  

The proposed project is expected to advance high-throughput precision manufacturing.  Currently the key technical bottleneck in diamond turning and other high-precision fabrication is the metrology process used for quality control. Existing practices to center a tool and to ensure the quality of the fabricated workpiece are very time-consuming, requiring several iterations to remove the workpiece from the machine for offline measurements and then to remount workpiece onto the machine. The removal and remount processes often introduce additional manufacturing errors. The proposed compact, snapshot, dual-mode, multi-wavelength interferometric system will incorporate several unique techniques to significantly improve speed and manufacturing accuracy. Specifically, a polarization-based multi-wavelength snapshot technique will enable the real-time measurement of machined surfaces with minimum environmental impact. A deep-learning-based phase unwrapping technique will eliminate the time-consuming phase unwrapping problem in interferometric measurement. The unique configuration ensures a very compact interferometric system that can be integrated seamlessly into existing equipment for in-situ metrology. The new fabrication process with real-time, in-situ metrology is estimated to improve efficiency by 30% or greater in tool alignment, and another 50% or greater in surface metrology.

This ability will be an enabler in several growing and emerging industry sectors, such as IoT, med-tech, wearables, and printed electronics. For the low-power systems that drive these applications, energy efficiency is the primary factor that determines critical characteristics such as size, weight, cost, reliability, and lifetime. Likewise, security is critical for these systems, as they collect and handle data encompassing many aspects of daily life and thus expose a huge attack surface for information security attacks. Automated solutions for security and energy efficiency developed in this project can potentially make a disruptive impact on the IoT space, which is predicted to have a market size of $457 billion by 2020. Tools developed in this project can significantly reduce design time and cost for application-specific systems, enabling wider deployment and providing traction for entirely new markets such as DIY printed processors. Additionally, these tools can improve information security for the population at large and allow broader deployment of intelligent systems integrated into a large number of daily activities. 

The proposed project will create commercial-grade electronic design automation tools that can automatically create an application-specific hardware design for a specific target application. These tools will have the capability to optimize designs for extreme energy efficiency and to perform security analysis that can guarantee the security of a system for a set of desired security properties. The primary work of this project involves translating research tools into commercial-grade tools, based on industry-defined needs and requirements. Transforming the research tools into tools that can be seamlessly integrated into industry design flows requires enhancements to allow the tools to support arbitrary hardware designs and system components. The tools must also be optimized to enable scalable analysis of larger hardware designs and more complex applications used in industry. To demonstrate commercial viability, the developed tools will be evaluated on industry designs and applications and must demonstrate the ability to create highly-optimized application-specific hardware designs quickly, efficiently, and automatically with little engineering effort. Tools that can meet these objectives will have strong commercial potential in a number of industries that require ultra-low-power application-specific systems, such as IoT, med-tech, and printed electronics.

Every year in the United States, nearly 120 million tons of CCA are generated, of which only 40% is reused; few recycling avenues exist for the remaining CCA, affecting the environment and human health. Simultaneously, increased demand for LWA has impacted costs in the concrete and geotechnical industries.  Converting CCA to value-added LWA addresses not only the CCA risk, but both these factors at once by developing a product with improved physical performance at lower costs. CCA is abundantly available in the United States, and LWA can be produced near its markets.  This project will also encourage students, including underrepresented minorities and females, in engineering.  

The proposed project will formulate, develop and validate an innovative scalable thermodynamic-based manufacturing technology that can be used to produce sustainable LWA from unused/waste CCA. Using thermodynamic principles and phase equilibria, sintering process of CCA will be tuned to partially melt the oxide compounds of CCA and subsequently combust emitted gas during sintering to create porous CCA-based LWA materials. The developed technology will enable identification of optimized raw material blending, appropriate fluxing agent selections, and the sintering process despite CCA heterogeneity, chemical composition and diversity, allowing conversion of significant amount of unused and waste CCA into value-added CCA-based LWA. This project will develop the technology by (1) looking at the chemical interactions between various types and dosages of CCA and fluxing agents to produce LWA, (2) identifying the thermodynamics of phase equilibria as a function of temperature during sintering as dosage and compositions of CCA vary and (3) preparing a robust technology guideline calibrated with experimental laboratory pilot-scale works.

The stability of these protein-based drugs is a major concern for ensuring a 2-year shelf-life for liquid formulations under refrigerated temperatures. Currently, the industry assessment standard involves 1-month long stability tests under stressed storage conditions. Improving the efficiency and accuracy of alternative pre-formulation and formulation screening tools should reduce the time required for phase 1 of drug development and make it possible to explore more proteins and more solution conditions. It is expected that the incorporation of this technology into the formulation workflow should help increase the number of therapeutic proteins that can be brought to market and reduce the cost of the products being sold. 

The proposed project involves the construction of a device designed to measure the susceptibility of a therapeutic protein to phase separation. Like oil and water, concentrated therapeutic protein solutions can separate into two distinct phases below a phase separation temperature, where the solution becomes cloudy. The phase separation temperature and the kinetics of the phase separation provide valuable metrics for instability and can be monitored by simple light scattering measurements via dark-field microscopy. Herein, we outline the development of hardware and software for a temperature gradient microfluidics device that can induce phase separation and extract parameters describing the underlying protein-protein interactions of the phase transition. The goals of this project are to engineer an automated system for controlling the temperature gradient, optical instrumentation, and data analysis. Ultimately, these research and development efforts will provide a prototype version of the temperature gradient microfluidics technology that can be implemented for measuring the stability of a variety of therapeutic proteins. Such high-throughput measurements will enable the exploration of pH, salt, buffers, and protein chemistries that contribute to formulation instability.

This would enable significant reduction in battery weight, size and cost for laptops, cell phones, wearable devices, all-electric vehicles, as well as grid storage. Beyond performance and cost, a major focus of this project is on battery safety.  In particular, we will explore novel methods to prevent short circuiting and heating problems in lithium-metal batteries, thereby rendering them safe.  The deliverable for this project will be a minimum viable product that can be subjected to third-party validation and also field-tested by potential customers. Such testing will provide a detailed understanding of device level performance, cost and safety metrics and will be instrumental in advancing this technology towards commercial viability.

For this, a broad range of activities (such as entrepreneurship training, communication skills development, venture support, internships etc.), will be offered to help students develop a holistic view of their research. 

The proposed project aims to replace graphitic anodes with a vastly superior alternative in Lithium-ion batteries. Instead of storing lithium atoms within a graphite host, we propose to store Lithium in its metallic form, which leads to much higher energy density. However, the Achilles heel for any Lithium-metal battery is the uncontrolled growth of dendrites which can electrically short the battery. We propose to overcome this challenge by utilizing a novel approach that involves applying high current densities of optimized magnitude (for healing purposes) to generate internal self-heat in the battery. This controlled heating triggers massive surface diffusion of Lithium on the dendritic surface, which blunts the dendrite tips and smoothens the Lithium metal surface. Our main objective is to demonstrate safe (i.e., dendrite-free) operation of high energy density and low cost Lithium-metal batteries in larger format pouch and cylindrical cells and perform detailed device level characterization.

For both humans and machines, speech comprehension can be difficult in noisy, complex environments with several competing sound sources. Many of these environments may have multiple devices that in turn each contain multiple microphones, such as smart speakers, smart-home appliances, mobile devices, and wearables. Unfortunately, these devices do not currently cooperate to perform spatial sound capture. If they could be connected together to perform large-scale spatial signal processing, such a distributed array could dramatically improve the performance of machine listening, human-computer interaction, and human sensory augmentation tasks. The ability to precisely localize, separate, and enhance sound sources in complex environments would enable new applications that are impossible with current technology. These technologies could be applied to many already-deployed acoustic systems with minimal additional bandwidth and computation requirements. This research has the potential to dramatically impact these and other application areas while training graduate and undergraduate students and post-doctoral researchers from a range of underrepresented groups in lean-startup approaches to technology commercialization. 

The proposed project will develop technologies to aggregate data from multiple devices containing acoustic arrays, such as smart-home devices and wearables, to improve the spatial sound processing performance of each individual device. The proposed technology uses a hierarchical, distributed processing approach to efficiently aggregate information across networked devices without transmitting full synchronous audio data. The resulting system can leverage the spatial diversity of the distributed array to achieve better performance than a single device in listening tasks, especially in adverse environments with strong noise and interference where current technology often fails. The research objectives of this project are to explore the design trade-offs and scaling behavior of systems at large-scale; determine how best to aggregate distributed array data in the presence of non-idealities such as sample clock mismatch, network latency, and bandwidth constraints; to characterize the performance scaling and design tradeoffs of the system in real-world environments and under various acoustic and network conditions; and to implement and demonstrate the new algorithms on embedded hardware.

This project will conduct laboratory experiments to mimic the conditions of a marine energy deployment site in order to evaluate the best design.  The knowledge acquired from these tests under a variety of flow conditions could be applied to numerous structures in the marine renewable energy industry and beyond.  In addition to the scientific discoveries, the educational goal underlines the PI's commitment to developing the entrepreneurial and leadership skills of graduate students and post-docs. Planned educational initiatives include active engagement with mentors from the marine energy industry and a highly immersive week-long entrepreneurship experience through an in-house program.

The proposed project will evaluate modified pylons that would include fairings composed of straight, convex, and concave plates behind the pylon. The fairings affect the downstream flow by altering separation lines as well as the shear layer and the entrainment layer in the wake of the pylon. This leads to a clean flow to the downstream rotor, minimizing the velocity reduction at the rotor disk and inflow angular variations.  We propose synergistic experimental and computational studies to evaluate pylon fairings at three different turbulence intensity levels that mimic the characteristic of potential tidal energy deployment sites. An active grid turbulence generator developed by the PI will be used to create elevated turbulence conditions in laboratory experiments. In addition, computational fluid dynamics studies would also be conducted to address the scaling issue - i.e., how the laboratory experiments would map to the full-scale pylon at the developer's site.

Current methods to generate accessible images on tactile paper printouts are bulky, time-consuming to develop, cost-prohibitive, and require sighted assistance. The proposed technology presents the opportunity to promote the participation of students who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) and enable them to equally benefit from active learning experiences as their sighted peers, especially in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. The proposed system will allow instant access to images for students who are BVI, supporting natural and intuitive interaction with visual scientific data and enabling them to perform observation-based tasks. Successful commercialization of the proposed system will remove a huge obstacle in the STEM education of BVI students and will encourage them to pursue a career in STEM related fields. The system also has the potential to play a critical role in enhancing social interaction in the BVI community. 

The proposed project will allow the development of a portable, low-cost system which enables individuals who are BVI to understand images in real time. There is currently no commercially available tool for BVI individuals that is portable and allows real-time exploration of images. The novelty of the proposed system developed is three-fold. As a tablet accessory, it is portable. It also incorporates a multisensory feedback interface comprising modalities such as haptics, sound and vibration. Lastly, it is deployed with an intelligent computing unit that uses Computational Neural Networks to characterize visual information and optimally delivering it through various sensory modalities. Using a multisensory and intelligent interface with digital images poses a novel solution to increase efficiency of exploration and perception of visual data in real-time. The team at Purdue University will develop and beta test a portable image exploration system allowing BVI individuals to use a portable controller with supporting software to explore images in real-time. This will result in prototypes for beta testing to assess usability, performance, reliability, and overall user satisfaction. Results will be used to assess the overall impact of the proposed system.

This technology addresses an unmet medical need for patients with stroke or spinal cord injury who frequently have impaired hand function that interferes with many activities of daily life such as feeding, but also negatively affects their professional work (e.g. inability to use a computer keyboard). It provides objective diagnostic markers on motor function that can guide therapy. In addition, the device promotes a patient-centered, customized physical therapy that allows tailoring physical exercises to the current state of the patient, and subsequently to adjust these exercises to the patient's therapeutic progress, potentially enabling patients to train longer and more rigorously. Extra practice will either lead to higher levels of functional independence or faster recovery within the reimbursable care time leading to reduced total health care costs per patient. At present, there is no mature competing technology on the market. A preliminary market analysis shows a high commercial potential in the market for medical rehabilitation devices. 

The proposed project takes the necessary steps to advance the commercialization of this robotic technology. Its aims respond directly to identified customer needs. Development addresses the following key technological hurdles: 1) Reduce the footprint of the device and make it mobile. The team will redesign the encasement and build a system that can be moved easily within and between care environments. 2) The team will simplify the user interface of the control software to enable easy access and operation for therapists without an extensive technical training. 3) Therapists and rehabilitation managers desire automated outcome reports to reduce the reimbursement documentation burden for therapists. The team will design software that records and analyzes the signals from the robotic sensors to generate objective markers of motor performance that can be included in a digital report of therapeutic progress. 4) Most of the rehabilitation exercises currently implemented in rehabilitation robots are largely monotonous, repetitive exercises that often lead to disengagement. In response, the team will design new gamified physical rehabilitation exercises based on the Unity programming language, which is the standard in the computer gaming industry.

Considering that thermal and water management systems impose substantial constraints, complexity, and cost on hydrogen energy systems, these characteristics offer a substantial opportunity to more broadly deploy clean energy technologies. The research plan includes a systematic investigation of the properties of nanocomposite membranes, varying their composition - including each of the components and the volume fraction of each - to strategically understand the impact on relevant properties including conductivity, gas permeability, and mechanical integrity. To enable these efforts, the research plan also involves development of membrane fabrication techniques relevant for nanocomposite membranes at the lab scale and also facilitating the translation to industrial scale, cost-effective manufacturing.

The fundamental significance resides in exploring medical action of cold atmospheric plasmas, in particular plasma interaction with tumor and surgical margins. For this, a flexible, morphing plasma device adaptable to any surface topography will be fabricated. Also, a wide spectrum of diagnostic instrumentations, and chemical and biological sensors for in vitro tests will be employed, which basically constitutes the technological significance of the project.

We will design new materials, made from renewable resources and thus benign and environmentally sound, that solve key problems in drug delivery to patients. These currently unsolved problems include the inability to create patient-friendly formulations (pills) from drugs that require high doses (creating hard to swallow ""horse pills""). Another important unsolved problem is failures of many drug candidates that tend to quickly form crystals from a water solution. When these drugs fail, cost of drug development goes up, which is ultimately passed along to patients. Drugs that would otherwise effectively treat diseases and are sorely needed by patients, never reach them. Our work will bring more drugs to patients, faster and more cheaply, and will reduce cost, side effects, dose, and variation in performance from patient to patient for drugs currently on the pharmacy shelf.

These materials will be carefully designed so as to be easily made by current manufacturers of cellulose derivatives, and to work exceptionally well at enhancing the performance of drugs. They will be designed to help create solutions of current drugs, or drug candidates that are under development, that have far more dissolved drug per volume than is possible using current technologies. The ability to create these more concentrated solutions of drug or drug candidates in the human body will permit patients to get enough drug/drug candidate into their bloodstream to have the desired therapeutic effect, but at much lower drug dose. We will design, make, and characterize these materials, show that they work to create more concentrated solutions of key drugs, and figure out what features enhance their performance, so we can design even better materials.

The proposed project deals with torrefaction of solid waste that comprises mostly fiber and plastic to convert them into clean, high-calorific-value solid fuels. The main challenges in using solid wastes for energy applications are: (1) inhomogeneity within the waste streams; (2) materials in the waste that are hazardous to the environment and equipment, such as chlorine and potassium; and (3) the converted fuel should be grindable to enable its applications in coal-fired boilers.  The team, comprising two academic institutions and a commercial entity, is developing new approaches to solve these hurdles.   Inhomogeneity is being resolved by sorting metals and glass and blending the sorted waste with fiber or plastic waste to obtain a consistent blend.  Torrefaction is helping to solve the two latter hurdles.  During torrefaction, the material becomes brittle and hence can be pulverized to the required size.  The hazardous materials are removed after torrefaction, by dissolving the brittle material in aqueous solution that dissolved the hazardous material, specifically chlorine and potassium.  Plastic has been found to play a major role in the quality of final pellets, as it increases the calorific value and enables producing high density pellets that are safe, durable, and water resistant.

The efforts targets a proxy crop, snap bean, and three proxy applications prioritized by our industry partners as key to their commercial efforts, namely disease risk modeling, harvest timing/scheduling, and yield prediction to propel FARMS into a sustainable innovation ecosystem. This is essential, since although the UAS agricultural market is pegged at US$34.2B globally, the USA is lagging due to past restrictions on commercial UAS flights. The FARMS Alliance will find fertile ground for growth in Upstate NY, where the Finger Lakes Regional Economic Development Council has identified agriculture as a strategic growth area. This effort will afford the Finger Lakes region an opportunity to be a hub in the Eastern USA for agriculture and food production and with coordination, will lead to leadership and growth in the industry. Finally, at least four imaging science and six business graduate students will be trained at the nexus of imaging-precision-agriculture-business, equipped as truly trans-disciplinary scientists and managers.

The proposed project will contribute significantly to the identification of both spectral (color) and structural (3D) signatures from UAs platforms that are coupled to specific precision agriculture applications. We will improve on the relatively simple and generic current approaches, and develop new methods to distill oversampled UAS remote sensing data to the essence of metrics required for each application. This close collaboration between imaging scientists and plant physiologists will lead to turn-key, specific (optimized) solutions for our industry partners, to then market to the burgeoning precision agriculture economy. In short, expensive UAS systems will be used to derive commercial, affordable, and practical UAS solutions that can transition to the precision agriculture sector.  Finally, this approach will hedge consistent, reliable image processing via proper spectral calibration of the target scene and the instruments themselves - this sets the FARMS Alliance apart from similar, simple spectral metric solutions that currently are being offered by precision agriculture service providers.

This liquid metal sensors-based wearable is designed to move human movement evaluation from laboratory environments to where people normally perform work: the real world. This project will create an affordable foot-ankle wearable to properly assess wearer gait and leg symmetry for people of all shapes and sizes without requiring expensive, bulky equipment or a practitioner's expertise. Moreover, the proposed tool is accurate, yet is also accessible meaning that this capability could improve quality of life via proper prognosis and diagnosis within competitive athletics as well as for medical patients during real-world task assessments. This project can also be used to support the national defense of the United States by providing the ability to assess movement measures, such as step count, acceleration, and ground reaction force estimation of military personnel, aiding in tactical planning and identification of oncoming injuries to limb segments. Over time, joints will fatigue and failure to identify these stressors can have a severe impact on the battlefield just as in the practice courts or industrial environments. 

The proposed project repurposes soft robotic sensors to accurately and noninvasively capture movement and force data in near real-time at the foot-ankle to provide meaningful performance and risk assessment for tailoring training regimens. This wearable solution is in response to collegiate and professional-level strength and conditioning coaches and trainers desire for a precise solution that captures movement data ""from the ground up"". The proposed solution will accurately capture ankle kinematic and kinetic data outside of the lab, giving coaches, trainers, medical staff, and researches a wealth of information that was previously not available or trusted by field practitioners. Intellectual merits include: (a) expanding state-of-the-art wearable solutions to measure absolute foot-ankle angles, (b) using custom liquid metal sensors to measure foot forces, and (c) combining complex angle and force measurements into machine learning systems estimating ankle injury risk thereby allowing practitioners to effectively monitor repetitive movements. The project goal is to create an accurate yet affordable wearable system that can identify potential risks of the most common injury, ankle strain. Collegiate student athletes will be used for design validation as initial project scope is designed for competitive sports; however, the solution will be expandable to industrial and military repetitive motions.

Over 40% of the biopharmaceuticals approved by FDA since 2008 are marketed in lyophilized dosage forms, and many pharmaceutical products could not be commercially viable without lyophilization. However, lyophilization is among the most expensive and time-consuming unit operations in pharmaceutical manufacturing, with batch-mode operation, open-loop processing, and lack of real-time product quality monitoring. A typical production lyophilization cycle usually takes from a few days to two weeks with typical operating costs of over $50,000 per day. As much as 30% of this time is wasted because of overly conservative cycles due to lack of in-process product monitoring and closed-loop control. This project will translate to manufacturing readiness several technologies that are currently in development and will accelerate the transition to automated lyophilization and enable ""self-driving"" lyophilizers. 


The proposed project addresses three interconnected technical challenges by co-development of: (i) Noninvasive product temperature monitoring using wireless probes that are compatible with aseptic processing requirements; (ii) Accelerated biomolecule stability analytics by solid-state hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry; and (iii) Real-time lyophilization rate measurement and closed-loop process control based on distributed wireless probes and computational modeling of the heat and mass transfer in the product, container and the lyophilizer equipment. The project activities are expected to advance knowledge in several fields, namely a) fluid/thermal transport in low-pressure conditions; b) flexible hybrid electronics for RF systems in extreme environments; c) biomolecule degradation mechanisms and analytical methods. The technologies will be implemented in a lyophilizer at Purdue's lyophilization technology demonstration facility and tested under realistic manufacturing constraints in collaboration with industry partners. The research and technology development activities will be complemented by dissemination of results to the lyophilization user community. Educational modules related to technologies developed in this program will be included in training courses organized by LyoHUB, an industry-university consortium based at Purdue University.

A multidisciplinary team of researchers, clinicians, and industry partners will build, evaluate, and commercialize state-of-the-art technologies that proactively detect adolescent online risk behaviors, including mental health issues, sexual solicitations, and online harassment, for the purpose of mitigating these risks and preventing harm. The team plans to release two separate technology offerings: First, an open source project that shares our risk detection algorithms with developers, so that they can build upon these solutions and form a community dedicated to promoting adolescent online safety. Second, a commercial product that combines these risk detection algorithms into an easy-to-use and accessible service that provides needed support and infrastructure to internet-based companies, who ultimately facilitate the risks teens encounter online, so that they can share in the joint responsibility of protecting the teens who use their platforms. It is imperative that as a society we become more proactive about protect teens from online risks, especially the most vulnerable teens who are at highest risk of engaging in online activities that can lead to physical harm or even death.

The proposed project addresses the critical and timely problem of adolescent online safety by leveraging a multi-disciplinary approach of human-centered machine learning to accurately detect risks teen encounter online. The work will be accomplished in four stages: 1) a user-centered phase that examines the types of online risk exposure that matter most to teens and their families. With this insight, the team will build evidence-based adolescent online risk models that identify key dimensions and patterns of risk. 2) a data-driven phase that draws upon these models to establish ground truth and annotate a rich training set of teen social media data, 3) a machine-learning phase that improves existing and builds new risk detection algorithms that are contextualized to teens and able to detect behavioral changes over time, and 4) a technology development phase that evaluates our solution and commercializes it within two separate product lines. The end result will be a suite of algorithms tailored to adolescents that detect objectionable content within social media and identify problematic behavioral patterns or changes that are indicative of impending risks over time. This work will enable real-time online safety interventions that protect and empower teen internet users.

This project is a collaboration between academia and industry to enhance current security solutions used in e-commerce, banking, smart cities, supply chains, smart health, machine to machine communications and the emerging Internet of Things. In addition to the scientific impact of opening up new research opportunities for scholars (faculty, graduate and undergraduate students), R&D, and production line workforce in semiconductor and security industry, this project has a great socioeconomic impact by restoring people's trust on using advanced technology and internet based service. Making the system robust to security attacks will save the country millions of dollars noting that more than $11 million dollars is spent directly to combat cybercrime in the US with an annual raise of 22%. 

The proposed project offers a proof-of-concept security module that uses fabrication variability of embedded memories in electronic devices to secure web-based communication protocols against hacking attacks. In contrast to the current cryptographic methods, where the keys are store in conventional memories, no security keys will be stored in the proposed security module; therefore it will be highly protected against cloning attempts to provide full security in the case of physical hijacking. Further, recently developed ultra-low power memories will be used to make the developed module secure to side channel attacks, as an additional key feature of this device. Using a novel error correction mechanism by integrating ternary state logic, artificial intelligence and recent advances in modern coding theory, a long-lasting problem of key generation mismatch is resolved by making the key generation failure rate infinitesimal.

The proposed project addresses challenges facing cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels in mass timber construction. Construction currently requires extreme care to protect CLT panels from moisture while ensuring long-term durability. Although builders take measures to reduce moisture exposure, it is inevitable that the CLT panels will take on water during their service-life. This project addresses these problems by utilizing thermal modification to produce chemical-free, mass timber panels with increased resistance to moisture and decay and improved dimensional stability. The goals are to: (1) evaluate process-performance relationships for thermal modification of small-diameter wood strands, and (2) demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing high-performance cross-laminated strand-veneer lumber (CLSVL) mass timber panels. The objectives are to: (1) demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing thermally modified laminated strand veneer lumber for production of high-performance CLSVL panels, and (2) determine the potential environmental impacts of the new CLSVL panels. The technical results include validation of a repeatable process for thermally modifying small-diameter pine strands, validation of a method for manufacturing CLSVL panels, verification of physical and mechanical performance of the CLSVL panels, and establishment of commercially-viable process-performance relationships to enable commercial production of the CLSVL mass timber panels.

Irrigation with saline water is a complex problem requiring consideration of many factors such as irrigation water quality, soil conditions, plant tolerance thresholds, and weather forecasts. This project will develop a prototype wireless sensor network and a control system that consider sensor inputs, user-defined thresholds and weather forecasts to determine when and where to irrigate. From an economic perspective, implementation of even a single soil moisture sensor in home lawns can significantly reduce water consumption and produce a return on investment within a few months. Cities stand to save millions of dollars by implementing efficient irrigation technology to reduce water use. The proposed adaptive system for irrigation with reclaimed water thus represents a tremendous potential market for more efficient water use.

The proposed project offers a transformative approach for landscape irrigation based on closed-loop control. Landscape irrigation accounts for a majority of urban summer domestic water use; irrigating with reclaimed water has the potential to substantially extend water resources but may pose hazards to environmental and plant health. Existing ?smart? irrigation control systems have proved water-efficient but have limitations and have not been widely adopted. The proposed system is unique in its combination of wireless water and soil quality sensors into an advanced network capable of controlling several critical agronomic variables, while welcoming but limiting the need for human inputs. A team of domain experts in academia and industry will work together to understand the practical challenges and to design such an adaptive irrigation system to address widespread water resource issues. Key contributions of the proposed research are (1) realizing a truly self-organizing ad-hoc wireless irrigation sensor and actuator network that integrates traditional monitoring and stakeholder input for adaptive irrigation control; and (2) testing the efficient and protective delivery of saline irrigation water using the network.

These types of optical components are widely applied in practice, for example, in telecommunication systems, laser technology, medical sensor systems, television screens, and imaging instrumentation. The project lays a foundation for a pioneering device technology with new operational regimes and applicability. Simultaneously, the project enhances scientific and technological understanding by elucidating the optical properties and utility of lossless nanostructured resonant films on which the device concept is based. These research and development activities will strengthen US competitiveness in nanophotonics and metamaterials. Moreover, this project establishes partnerships between industry and academia. An academic team will provide device design specifications and prototype fabrication. A primary industrial partner will potentially distribute polarizes meeting specifications via existing sales and marketing platforms. The project provides excellent analytical and experimental experience for both graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The project is likely to have high commercial impact, as the proposed patent-pending lossless polarizers with the predicted performance attributes do not currently exist in the market. 

The proposed project delivers new polarizer technology based on original ideas in photonic device engineering. The intellectual merit of this technology lies in the novelty of our discovery that a sparse grid of dielectric nanowires is nearly completely invisible to one polarization state while being opaque to the orthogonal polarization state with this property existing over significantly wide spectral bands. It is scientifically extremely important that the high-efficiency, wideband spectra presented can be generated in these minimal resonance systems. Based on this discovery, our research objectives focus on design, fabrication and testing of compact, low-loss, dielectric polarizers for deployment in key spectral regions. Accordingly, we will design and fabricate simple single-layer elements as well as nanogrid multi-module lattices that provide excellent performance using a variety of practical materials. We plan complete spectral verification of the fabricated devices and comparison with theoretical predictions. We will measure polarization performance including bandwidth and extinction ratios in reflection and transmission of individual two-grating modules and of concatenated multilayer modules. Technical goals include high polarization extinction ratios of 1,000,000:1 and insertion loss below 1%. Manufacturing strategies involving high-resolution UV-laser interferometric patterning and carefully chosen materials will accomplish the goals of the project.

OLEDs are the most energy efficient means of producing light, provide higher color quality and contrast (a true black) in displays, and the devices are bendable allowing unique shapes. Despite many years of research this technology is still limited by short lifetimes of the materials that emit blue light, which has prevented large scale commercial applications. Stable blue light emitting compounds will dramatically increase the lifetime of cell phone and television displays and general lighting employing OLED technologies, which will revolutionize these industries. The greatest want of consumers for their mobile phones is longer battery life, and OLEDs provide minimum energy consumption of display technologies. Stable blues are also the limitation of applications for white in general lighting applications. Considering that 20% of the electricity generated in the US is consumed in lighting, employing technology that is 90-98% more efficient than incandescent lighting will dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save billions of dollars. This project will evaluate recently discovered complexes with superior stability and color characteristics for application in OLED devices. 


The proposed project will evaluate the in-device characteristics of recently discovered CCC-NHC pincer complexes as the blue emitter component. A modular, efficient synthesis provides access to complexes that can be altered systematically to evaluate device functionality and characteristics in a logical manner. These complexes have been demonstrated to have superior air- and water-stability to currently employed materials. The protection of the emitters by employ of sophisticated barrier technology represents a significant cost and engineering challenge for device manufacture. Devices will be prepared, initially, with spin coating fabrication, the fastest readily-available processes, and evaluated for key characteristics relevant to commercialization and industrial manufacturing. The most promising candidates will be evaluated in devices prepared by thermal evaporative deposition (TED), which provides device characteristics more relevant to commercial manufacturing processes. An additional advantage is that through easy alteration in device fabrication conditions or the structure of the emitter, these materials produce white light relevant for general lighting applications. Successful completion of the project will lead to licensing of the technologies or to the formation of a company to produce the emitting materials for the OLED display and lighting industries.

Gastrointestinal diseases affect an estimated 60-70 million Americans annually, with an estimated 4-5 million hospitalizations, 70 million ambulatory care visits and over 200,000 deaths attributable to gastrointestinal disease. Spending on gastrointestinal diseases in the U.S. has been estimated at over $140 billion per year in direct and indirect costs. There are over 18 million gastrointestinal endoscopies performed annually in the U.S. with a total cost for outpatient gastrointestinal endoscopy of over $32B.  The objective of this proposal is an assessment of a novel micro-textured balloon design to improve endoscopy outcomes. The research project will also increase the economic competitiveness of the United States by training graduate and undergraduate students in innovation, customer discovery, market assessment, intellectual property protection, technology translation, business development and commercialization. Partnerships between academia and industry will be strengthened through collaboration with manufacturing industry in pursuit of novel extrusion micro-texturing methods, and bringing industry standards and materials processing knowledge back to the classroom. 

The proposed project will enable micro-texturing of endoscopy balloons by formulating the preliminary techniques required to manufacture micro-textured at scale. This project will also demonstrate prototype micro-textured balloon performance on the benchtop and in vivo as compared to conventional endoscopy methods. Endoscopy performed with micro-textured balloons will save time, save money, and improve patient outcomes compared to current balloon endoscopy. Micro-texturing balloons dramatically increases friction and balloon anchoring, thereby allowing more effective use balloon endoscope technologies. The goals of the proposed research are two-fold. First, evaluating efficacy of the micro-textured balloons through a tiered approach coupling benchtop testing with in vivo animal procedure testing. Second, novel manufacturing methods for cost-effective fabrication will be explored, both in the laboratory and by working closely with industry partners. The intellectual merit of this research lies in 1) experimentally measuring the anchoring forces of micro-textured balloons as a function of balloon geometries and micro-texture geometries, 2) quantitatively measuring the effectiveness in vivo as compared to conventional endoscopy methods, and 3) enabling innovative manufacturing methods to micro-texture extruded materials.

Significant results have included: 1) Establishing a measurement framework for measuring anchoring force on the benchtop using excised animal tissue. This allows for consistent comparison of micro-texture designs and manufacturing methods. 2) Extensive testing using synthetic and porcine tissues using the measurement device and methods established. 3) Using these outcomes, a leading candidate balloon and texture design was chosen, with a companion manufacturing method that we will transfer to a manufacturing partner for small-scale manufacturing leading to FDA submission.

In parallel, a 3-week long, mini-NSF I-Corps program allowed our team to understand the needs of the physician (faster more effective balloon anchoring), the lab managers (effective treatment with faster endoscopy suite turnover), and the buyers (costs ? including patient and physician satisfaction, device costs, and endoscopy suite turnover). Also, a 3-month long Innosphere accelerator program allowed our team to build a pitch deck and business plan around understanding the market need, the competition in the space, how much capital would be needed to move this technology into the endoscopy centers, and our regulatory pathway.

In summary, these technology results and business development are allowing the team to move the technology from bench to bedside through the formation of a medical device company to bring these balloons to physicians to improve patient outcomes.

Each year approximately $500,000 Americans will undergo surgery involving intervertebral disc replacement, resulting in a device market well over $1 billion. These procedures, which are most often interbody fusions or TDRs, are associated with a high rate of complications.  Approximately one-third of patients will ultimately require a follow-up procedure.  Although the underlying causes are unclear, the biomedical devices most often used are significantly stiffer than the original intervertebral disc, and no cushioning or force dissipation occurs across the disc space; this is likely a significant factor for complications such as subsidence and adjacent level disease. This study will be the first cyclic loading investigation into the use of novel liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) for potential use in spinal devices. If successful, the proposed research will develop LCEs for stable long-term mechanical dissipative properties with a hierarchical structure to mimic the natural organization of the intervertebral disc. Other potential applications involving the use this ultra-dissipative material are for protective equipment used in sports or military, such as helmets to better prevent concussions. 


The proposed project will investigate main-chain LCEs, which have vastly superior energy dissipation properties relative to traditional rubber-like materials such as silicone or hydrogels. Liquid crystal mesogen reorientation under mechanical stress provides a temperature and frequency insensitive mechanism for dissipating energy, more robust than typical viscoelasticity. This proposed research will be the first to investigate cyclic mechanical properties of main-chain LCEs. The proposed research will result in an LCE proof-of-concept device that exhibits mechanical properties seen in biological soft tissues (i.e., anisotropy, dampening, and low modulus). The LCE will be synthesized a spatially tailored device to match the mechanical properties and structure of a natural disc. The unique liquid-crystal structure within these materials makes cyclic behavior difficult to estimate a priori, and therefore direct characterization as a function of material structure, strain rate, and displacement magnitude must be investigated. High-cycle loading of LCEs will be investigated. Fundamental knowledge gained through this analysis will show the feasibility of LCEs for TDR and demonstrate broad applicability of LCEs for dampening applications. This project builds directly from fundamental research discovery supported by the NSF.

SC-CMs are a promising source of heart cells that can be grown in the laboratory from stem cells and used to address significant healthcare issues facing this country. These cells can potentially be used to engineer tissue to treat patients with heart disease/failure, or to screen for cardiotoxic side effects of drugs. Before these cells can be used for these applications, however, the cells must be purified to remove undesired cells from the cell population that may affect normal heart function.  Currently, no established technique can reliably perform this purification.

HMF is a critical, versatile and renewable immediate that can be used to produce fuels and a variety of other products such as polymers including polyesters, polyurethanes, polyamides and poly(ethylene-furanoate); binders, adhesives, coatings and foams, some of which have market size in the range of billion lb/yr.  The worldwide HMF industrial production is 30 tons/year. It is not produced in any industrial scale because it is not yet an economic viable product. The proposed technology is designed to change that. The catalytic process proposed in this project will be significant avoiding the food-or-fuel dilemma. The solvent used in the process is green and environmental friendly. The polymeric solid acid catalyst is non-toxic and reusable. The project will also train skilled workers for the emerging biorefinary industry. The technology if successful and commercialized could benefit the state of Arkansas in effective utilization of crop residues. This project involves close collaboration with a minority and women-owned industrial partner for commercialization. 

The proposed project aims to develop cost effective production of HMF using a paradigm shift catalytic membrane reactor to hydrolyze agricultural residues including rice and wheat straws and directly dehydrate hydrolyzed sugars to HMF with high yield and selectivity. HMF will be simultaneously separated from the product stream using size-based customized membranes. One of the keys to success lies in optimizing the polymeric solid acid catalyst that is capable of catalyzing both hydrolysis and dehydration reactions efficiently. The catalytic activity is shown to be tunable by varying the chain length and chain density of the grafted polymers on substrates. The catalyst and its activity are found to be stable over repeated runs. This green technology replaces the currently used highly corrosive sulfuric acid and expensive cellulase enzymes for biomass hydrolysis, as well as becoming a promising catalyst to replace the toxic metal chloride for glucose dehydration to HMF. Another key to success is the design of a catalytic membrane reactor for simultaneous HMF production and separation leading to process intensification and significant cost reduction. The ultimate goal of this project is to convert lignocellulosic biomass to HMF with high yield and high selectivity in an economical and environmental friendly manner.

With the scarcity of care options available, robots are a welcome solution for assisting elders with small tasks that would normally be done by a caregiver. These robots would serve in an estimated 17,000 elder care facilities nationwide. Robots will be able to identify elders and personalize their assistance while monitoring health parameters. Critically, this work will aim to understand how a robot capable of assistance in simple activities of daily living should behave to aid elders in a community long term care setting including the acceptance and willingness to receive assistance from the robot.

The proposed project addresses three research areas: 1) Robot Design for Elderly: How can we develop a useful affordable robot system for the elder-care community?  What is the elder-care community preference for humanoid robot forms over non-humanoid in a robot that provides assistance?  2) Robot Behavior for Elderly: How will the elderly react to an autonomous robot that can recognize individuals, call them by name and provide services? What effects will different designs have on the interaction such as form-factor, motions, expressiveness and modalities of interaction? 3)  Robotic Health Tracking of Elderly: As interactions with the robot occur in social settings, the robot can log data such as requests for water delivery from the robot, distance walked by the elders etc. What factors affect the quality of data can be obtained and how useful will this data be to clinicians? These questions will be answered by building a low cost robot using a variety of technologies developed from NSF-funded programs, then validating the performance with tests in an elder-care facility.

Today, product develop and manufacturing in many highly regulated industries is a long, expensive process that carries substantial commercial risks to manufacturers if products fail to reach markets and substantial personal risks to customers if the products fail in operations. If used properly, modeling and simulation methods can substantially reduce these risks and provide deeper insight into poorly understood physical processes in a product?s lifecycle.  However, these sophisticated methods are not as deeply adopted throughout industry supply chains as is needed to realize the benefits.  The work proposed here will use the methods of distributed systems, cyberinfrastructure, and information technology to broaden and simplify access to high performance computing resources and advanced modeling and simulation software, increasing the integration of advanced manufacturing with the innovations of computer science and cybersecurity in distributed systems, attracting and training a computer science-grounded workforce that can help enable a transformation in the manufacturing sector. 

The proposed project will address these challenges by leveraging the investment by the National Science Foundation in science gateways, which provide end user environments that simplify and secure access to advanced modeling and simulation software on high performance computing resources. The proposed project has a high degree of intellectual merit as it takes science gateways a step forward in engineering and cybersecurity maturity.  This project will develop a general approach for creating Application Programming Interfaces to science gateway middleware out of reconfigurable building blocks that can be mapped to the requirements of different user environments. These methods will be applied to the development of programming interfaces and data models derived from abstract models of a trusted digital commons science gateway developed in a private sector/academic partner collaboration. This gateway will allow the secure creation/sharing of executable models, support the process of reproducible verification of modeling and simulation methods, support the validation of a particular model for a particular physical product or process, and allow systematic exploration of uncertainty quantification in the models under diverse external conditions. Together, these capabilities will enable greater collaboration between manufacturers in a supply chain, manufacturers across industrial sectors, and between manufacturers and regulatory agencies.

The distributed carbon nanotube-based sensor can be attached to structural members to monitor deformations and cracks. Because the sensor is continuous, the deformations and cracks can be measured on all the surfaces where the sensor is applied and ultimately trigger an alarm if the sensor response exceeds a certain critical level. Knowledge gained in this project will increase the sustainability and robustness of critical infrastructure to benefit society and the environment. Long-term impacts will result in cost-effective monitoring protocols, extended life of structures, and reduced overall lifecycle costs. Ultimately, the economic competitiveness of United States is strengthened based on robust, resilient, and durable civil infrastructure. This project has promising commercial potentials in the approximate $630-million target market of SHM in North America for monitoring civil structures, including bridges and pipelines. The participation of students in research and entrepreneurship/innovation will build the pipeline of students entering the workforce to translate discoveries to new commercial products which will increase US global competitiveness.

The proposed project will establish the scalability and applicability for the use of distributed carbon nanotube-based composite sensors for in situ and real-time quantitative SHM. The use of SHM to monitor critical infrastructure is increasingly important, and structural failures can cause loss of human life as well as damage to the local economy. Through the use of carbon nanotube-based distributed sensors it will be possible to overcome the limitations of conventional sensors, which are based on a network of point or quasi-point sensors mounted on a structure that may miss the localized formation of damage. The distributed sensor offers tremendous flexibility in different applications by allowing the sensor to conform to a variety of complex surfaces, and new analysis techniques will be developed to rapidly interpret the data from the sensors - especially for structures with complex geometries ? utilizing direct current electrical measurements and impedance tomography. Key research objectives include the development of new data analysis techniques to rapidly localize damage, validation of the sensor for complex geometries and environmental exposure, and development of a prototype for field testing in real-world conditions.

Nearly 9% of US population meets criteria for SP and very few seek treatment. Use of augmented reality (AR) could, in the future, reduce barriers to seeking treatment and also improve the health provider's ability to effectively and efficiently deliver evidence-based therapy. Costs of delivering 'minimally adequate treatment' for SP can range from $600-$900 per patient and can be much higher for payers, patients, and health providers. Fortunately, augmented reality would allow the advantages of providing therapy in a virtual environment with lower costs and greater flexibility of options for the healthcare provider.

Even with the high cost of operating the current HVAC systems, occupant dissatisfaction with thermal environments in workplaces have been highlighted by several recent studies. This project seeks to address this issue through the integrated application of i) data-driven learning of the indoor environment, and ii) integrated control of heterogeneous HVAC elements that typically exist in such shared office spaces. Firstly, it will utilize data driven modeling of complex spatiotemporal dynamics of the physical environment, and the dependency between the controls available and the environmental variables. Secondly, it will utilize the data-driven model towards integrated control of the heterogeneous HVAC elements associated with the space to attain differentiated temperatures across the space as desired by the occupants. The product of this project will be a software prototype that will operate in conjunction of sensor and IoT devices, and networked HVAC elements.

Such a device is key to enabling Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) to be used as a viable, economical electricity storage approach that can be deployed anywhere. Such an energy storage system can be used to save surplus electricity that would otherwise be waster to be used when demand is high. Also, as intermittent renewable energy resources such as wind and solar supply a larger portion of the electricity supply, energy storage is needed to supplement these resources when they are not available. The gas compressor can also be used for compressing other gases, such as carbon dioxide and gases used in many industries, with less energy consumption. The reduction in energy consumption and greenhouse gases will consequently increase the energy security of the U.S. and help combat climate change. 

The proposed project will develop and validate the performance of a prototype device for compressing and expanding gas to and from a high pressure. High efficiency will be achieved if the compression and expansion processes occur at constant temperature. To attain both high efficiency and high power, the compressor/expander will incorporate design that augments heat transfer. The prototype design will be based upon prior fundamental research that has led to two orders of magnitude increase in power density without sacrificing efficiency. This project advances the technological know-how of compressing and expanding gases more efficiently. In particular, it makes advances on the technique of achieving isothermal compression/ expansion using a liquid piston augmented with porous media heat transfer. Although the fundamental benefits of this approach have been established in prior research, these benefits have not been realized in a device. This project fills the knowledge gaps that exist to create such a devices by providing insight and understanding on optimal system design, valving, sensing and control, and the management of liquid-gas interface, which are necessary to achieve continuous reciprocating operation.

In the past decade, development of the residential solar photovoltaic across the nation has disrupted the way in which centralized electricity systems operate. As solar panel system prices have fallen dramatically in the past few years, a residential solar battery system that can operate off-grid remains relatively expensive.

The proposed AFM probe can extend its functionality from a single-channel to multi-channel probe such that it can be easily employed in various AFM schemes to characterize multi-physical properties beyond topography.

Since the 1950s, the gold standard of care has been to implant a tube, called a shunt, that drains excess fluid surrounding the brain elsewhere in the body where it can be safely absorbed.  While this treatment is effective, the shunts fail at high rates and most commonly because of clogging.  Because there are no clear patient symptoms and medical imaging technologies do not have sufficient resolution, patients live in fear that their headache may be an early sign of failure and must live close to a major medical center.  A major reason why shunt technology has not advanced in many decades is that there are no sensors that can determine when and why shunts fail.  In the near term, this innovation in miniaturized sensing technology will enable definitive diagnosis of shunt failure and in the long term, provide valuable data that can inform the design of failure-resistant shunts.  The potential societal impacts are reduced emergency room visits and improved quality of life for patients and family members.  The potential commercial impacts are new products for hydrocephalus and other medical conditions. 


The proposed project will enable a major improvement in hydrocephalus care since the introduction of shunts in the 1950s.  Hydrocephalus patients suffer from an imbalance in the production of fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord and its absorption by the body.  A shunt implanted in the brain diverts fluid elsewhere in the body where it can be safely absorbed.  The portion of the shunt implanted in the brain clogs at high rates leading to vague patient symptoms at first but that become progressively worse.  A major obstacle is the inability to determine that a shunt is about to fail without surgery.  This can be solved by integrating wireless sensors into the shunt that warn of failure.  New advancements have enabled extremely small sensors that can monitor treatment directly in the shunt.  The goal of this project is to integrate different sensor types that provide complementary information in a smart shunt, develop a simulated benchtop model of a hydrocephalic patient, and demonstrate that the smart shunt can provide accurate information on the proper function or failure of the shunt.  The realistic benchtop model of the patient is critical to optimize sensors prior to future pre-clinical testing.

The breakthrough scientific and commercial opportunity stems from the use of parallel computing hardware developed in recent years in support of the computer gaming industry, that has not been leveraged yet for solution of simulation problems currently addressed using finite element methods. This can lead to a breakthrough in the simulation industry by embracing an approach to the solution of boundary value problems that does not require inversion of large matrices. The proposed approach will benefit several scientific and engineering applications where large dimensions or multi-scale geometries makes meshing computationally prohibitive, and addresses critical bottlenecks in engineering design and simulation, in particular in transient analysis and design optimization. The potential business opportunity is significant: the successful adoption of the proposed approach would lead to a major breakthrough in the performance of software for engineering and scientific simulation, while exploiting newly available parallel computing resources (gaming graphics engines).


The proposed project supports the development of an inexpensive, highly parallel simulation platform that can be integrated with pre and post processing tools of existing finite-element software. The proposed module will be implemented using gaming graphics processors, enabling a breakthrough speed-up in simulation time compared to conventional finite element software. The final deliverables will be presented to potential partners or investors for commercialization and future development. Interviews with engineers and scientists under an NSF I-Corps study revealed a significant need and interest for simulation tools that address the bottlenecks of existing finite-element tools, in particular in terms of prohibitively long simulation times. The proposed project is transformative for the following reasons: (i) A novel approach for the simulation of complex systems using highly-parallel computing is proposed, (ii) the proposed approach can lead to a breakthrough reduction in simulation time compared to available software in large scale problems and transient analyses, and (iii) the proposed approach will lead to a simulation engine that can be integrated with pre and post processing tools from existing finite element method (FEM) software, enabling its use within well developed products that already have a solid customer base.

In contrast to two-dimensional images produced by conventional color cameras usually with three-color channels, hyperspectral techniques generate three-dimensional datasets known as datacubes with both spatial and spectral dimensions with hundreds of color channels. Hyperspectral methods lead to a vastly improved ability to classify and differentiate objects based on their spectral features enabling small, otherwise unnoticeable, features to be amplified. The societal impact of hyperspectral imaging is rapidly expanding and includes the development of advanced medical diagnostic tools, systems for precision agriculture, methods to ensure food quality, discovery of new minerals, and the evolution of national defense projects. However, despite the progress in analysis method development and computational speed, efficient computational approaches suitable for rapid analysis of datacubes are still lacking. Three-dimensionality of data and large file size presents a significant challenge for isolation of useful data, and consequently individual investigators developing their own tools. The development of an advanced and commercially available software package for hyperspectral data analysis will facilitate this work and enable users to search for new optical signatures across multiple applications.  

The proposed project sets a new software architecture that is capable of analyzing complex and computationally challenging datasets recorded by hyperspectral imaging systems. The proposed computational platform for data analysis of hyperspectral data will provide a unique and powerful tool to process hyperspectral data for a variety of applications: from medicine and remote vision to forensics and plants science. The research objective is to integrate current and new analysis methods into an interactive, fast, and intuitive hyperspectral imaging software that will offer an unprecedented level of flexibility in hyperspectral data processing. The proposed software program will be designed to be operated without any prior programming skills allowing interactive sessions of raw and processed data to be easily shared, explored and evaluated by both peers and newcomers. The major feature of the software is an open architecture that provides a common framework for the implementation of the additional methods from the user community. The commercially available platform will have structural flexibility to allow users to integrate their novel computational methods with relatively little effort. With this feature, the software is expected to be a central part of hyperspectral technology and will be the preferred software of the majority of users.

Many current practices in drug discovery and manufacturing are century-old, resulting in poor quality, poor patient compliance, poor scalability, and scarcity of many medicines. The proposed approach differs radically from existing practices in the pharmaceutical sector, enhances the properties of active ingre-dients in medicines, drives down the amount of solvents required for pre-clinical testing and thus reducing toxic chemical waste, yet is compatible with many existing drugs and dosage forms (e.g. pills, gel caps, patches, injections, etc.). If successful, the proposed technology could short-en by several years the drug development timeline, make it easier to combine multiple med-icines into a single pill or patch tailored to each patient, and reduce the amount of precious active ingredient being wasted due to body elimination or unused prescription medicines. 

The proposed project has significant intellectual merit, in that it leverages techniques from the semiconductor industry and nanotechnology to address long-standing problems in pharmaceutical science, development, and manufacturing. The process at the core of this project can print active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with precision and accuracy, while also enhancing their dissolution without resorting to strong or toxic solvents. It will advance understanding of thermal properties of pharmaceutical compounds, the link between molecular structure and crystal structure, and its influence on dissolution properties and bioa-vailability, which it enhances. While these capabilities have been shown for some compounds, they remain unavailable to the broader pharma research community. This multi-disciplinary project will make the capability widely available to molecular chemists, biologists, and pharmacologists, allowing them to devote more of their time to optimizing small molecular therapeutics for potency and site-specific binding, without facing solubility bottlenecks. The proposed work promises to unlock the therapeutic potential of millions of al-ready synthesized compounds that are languishing in material libraries due to their poor solubility, and to create combination therapies of unprecedented sophistication that will leverage deep learning- and data-driven medical science.

Innovations in this project will advance measurement technology by increasing confidence in detecting chemicals by extracting additional knowledge from the substances.  Such improvements will benefit specialists needing high speed, portable chemical analyzers and society broadly when such analyzers are employed in security, medical, and consumer applications.  The innovations in technology necessitate discovery and development on the behavior of substances as gas ions in strong electric fields.  Understandings of these behaviors should have impacts in chemical measurements science and other physical sciences beyond this particular technology.


The proposed project solves a key limitation in existing chemical analyzers based on ion mobility spectrometry which are capable only of highly selective detection and are unable to provide accurate chemical identification of substances.  The objective in this project is to enable chemical identification of substances using sequential multi stage processing of gas ions derived from a substance in small planar embodiments of ion mobility spectrometry.  In these structures, chemical class specific fragments are generated in strong electric fields in air at ambient pressure, a topic which is largely unexplored.

The proposed technology will be capable of evaluating EEGs in real-time in order to alert doctors when clinically relevant events such as seizures occur. This will improve patient outcomes by allowing doctors to intervene with medications in a timelier and more precise fashion. This work will also have the broader impact of improving science's understanding of the fundamentals of how machine learning can be applied specifically to neural signal processing, which is currently a poorly understood area.

This will be accomplished with three main tasks. In the first task, the existing seizure detection software, which currently works offline, will be converted to work in real-time with a target latency of 20 seconds to detect a seizure. This will be accomplished through intelligent memory handling and by developing a low-latency, highly optimized post-processing algorithm. The second task will strengthen the existing seizure detection code to operate at clinically acceptable levels of sensitivity and false alarm rates. This will be achieved by retraining our algorithms on a significantly more diverse and complex EEG database in order to expose the software to as many variations of seizure presentation as possible. In the third and final task, extensive software testing will be conducted in order to optimize the machine learning configuration that maximizes the gains achieved in Tasks 1 and 2.

The proposed project is aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the preclinical drug discovery process which is a major unmet need of the pharmaceutical industry. The objective of this project is to validate a technology utilizing C. elegans worms as an intermediary system to de-risk compounds during the early phases of the drug discovery process. The technology exposes a potential therapeutic drug to stress responses that are elicited in the worm and evaluates its ability to mitigate them as a proxy of its therapeutic potential. We will use an integrated approach that includes microscopy, genetics, and pharmacology to fully develop the technology. The project encompasses 3 milestones. The goal of Milestone 1 is to validate the technology by testing it in an environment that mimics an industrial setting. The goal of milestone 2 is to develop the technology to become fully automated. The goal of Milestone 3 is to establish mechanistic links between the test compounds and their biological targets.

The discovery process begins in vitro, by screening thousands of compounds in simple assays, typically cells in a Petri dish. The in vitro screening selects a pool of potential compounds of which only a few will be moved to the next step, i.e. in vivo testing on mammals (rodents and up). Testing in mammals is costly and time-consuming, and poses ethical challenges. As a result, many compounds that could potentially develop into therapeutic drugs, go undetected. One way to address this problem is to use simple animals such as worms, little fish and insects. The idea is that if a compound is effective in any of these simple animals, chances are it will also work in more complex organisms. Following this strategy, in this project we developed a drug-screening assay that uses the worm C. elegans. To test our assay in a unbiased manner we established a collaboration with Eli Lilly through their Open Innovation Drug Discovery program. They assembled a Pathway Exploration Cassette specifically tailored for our assay using previously internally tested and well-documented compounds. The cassette was composed of 72 compounds in four distinct developmental stages (compounds under development, compounds undergoing clinical trial, compounds FDA-approved and on the market and compounds that mimic therapeutic compounds but that are not therapeutic) that could potentially target various conditions. Compound identify was unveiled at the end of the screening, thus all 72 compounds were blindly screened. Overall the assay could correctly predict the developmental stages of the compounds. We also automated the assay, a key requirement in an industrial setting. This project has provided proof-of-concept for a drug-screening technology based on  C. elegans. Further development of the technology is warranted before it can meet industry standards. Nonetheless the C. elegans assay not only has the potential to expedite the drug discovery process but could significantly reduce the amount of valuable resources this process traditionally requires. Thus, by improving the way new drugs are discovered, this technology could contribute to the treatment of human disease and to the economy at large. The project offered several opportunities for training of students, not only in a variety of laboratory techniques, but also in unique ""industrial/commercial"" prospective. In total, ten persons worked on the project including two experts from the pharmaceutical industry (consultants) and an international undergraduate student, who was so excited about the project that he decided to further pursue a career in the USA.

The aim of this project is to develop a commercially viable, compact, table-top light source that provides suitable intensities and wavelengths to characterize materials and chemicals with increased sensitivity. This will complement the capabilities of the semiconductor and bio-medical industries to innovate in nanotechnology and biotechnology by allowing them to obtain a thorough understanding of their materials and systems in a cost-effective manner. This project will also enable the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students who are inclined towards the applied and commercial aspects of physics research. Contacts with suppliers of components for the infrared light source and with potential customers are further broad impacts of this project. This project has the potential to contribute to the economy of Virginia and the USA via the expected establishment of a start-up company that will create jobs, revenue, and intellectual property.

The proposed project will tackle the lack of commercially available light sources that are ultra-broadband and highly brilliant in the far- to near-infrared spectral range. The objective is to optimize the argon plasma light source prototype by increasing its lifetime of stable light output to hundreds of hours. The optimized product will improve data acquisition efficiency in spectroscopy applications especially in industry. The plan is to redesign this device improving on what has been learned from the previous iteration by optimizing the thermal properties, inner chamber design, and component replacement process allowing routine operation and maintenance to be simple, efficient, and reproducible. The characteristics of infrared radiation from a high temperature plasma in the frequency range between 100 cm-1 and 2500 cm-1 have not been studied in the past. This is because the quartz bulb in commercial xenon plasma lamps is opaque to infrared radiation in the above frequency range. The infrared emission characteristics of the proposed light source between 100 cm-1 and 2500 cm-1 and even higher frequencies will be measured using spectrometers and microscopes similar to the ones used extensively in industry, thus demonstrating the source's compatibility with existing spectroscopy equipment.

This research will yield new scientific as well as engineering knowledge into the automation processes to manufacture a new class of living products. Such fundamental knowledge will help usher in the next era of high-value bio-manufacturing and is needed to sustain the competitive advantage of our manufacturing economy. As a product, manufactured living bloods vessels have significant commercial potential in at least two areas. Manufactured blood vessels will be a less expensive alternative that replaces the use of animals in the testing of medical devices. Manufactured blood vessels will be used to treat and repair cardiovascular disease.


The proposed project will design, build and test a new fully automatic system for the manufacture of small living blood vessels to be used for reducing the use of animals in the testing of medical devices and to be ultimately used to treat patients with heart disease. To develop this automated manufacturing system, the project will add human cells to a specially designed mold to form living building parts in the shape of round donuts.  A robot will be programmed to retrieve these donut-shaped living building parts one-by-one and drop them into a specially designed funnel where the stack of donuts will form a long tube or living blood vessel. The built blood vessels will be housed in a bioreactor tank that controls the temperature and recirculates the broth needed to provide the nutrients that nourish and mature the living blood vessels until they are ready for use. This novel automated process will manufacture living blood vessels for research testing and for clinical application.

Small ring-shaped tissues were formed by seeding cells into  ring-shaped molds. Once formed, these ring-shaped tissues were picked up, one-at-a-time, by fluid suction from a liquid handling robot. The robot next performed a quality control step by  moving the tissue ring over an upward facing camera and if the tissue ring met specifications it was delivered to a funnel-guide which guided each tissue ring into an aligned stack of tissue rings that fused to form a long tube of living cells. This new knowledge and technical know how is significantly advancing the field of tissue engineering. The entire field of tissue engineering is limited by the lack of manufacturing methods that can be automated and scaled up and this project advanced a new innovation in this field that is applicable to many different cell types and disruptive to the field of tissue engineering and its many applications from drug discovery and toxicity testing to the repair of tissues. This work has been presented in a scientific journal and Brown University has filed a patent application on this technology.

The technique, called optical coherence tomography or OCT, can non-invasively image tissues with near cellular resolution and identify changes in structure due to disease or injury. While OCT has shown great capabilities for imaging the retina, the approach offers limited depth penetration which has prevented success in other tissues. We have developed a new approach for OCT, under NSF support (CBET 1133222), that significantly extends its depth penetration.  Increasing depth penetration will open up new applications, particular for diagnosing skin disease. We expect this project to help justify commercialization by our partner company by showing that the technology can image skin in a format that is compatible with medical practice of dermatologists and surgeons.  This proposal seeks to build and test a prototype system with enough scanning range to be useful to medicine.  The technology will be tested and validated with skin imaging in animal models. By increasing access to better biomedical imaging technology, we will advance the health and welfare of the American public.

The proposed project will advance a new imaging modality, dual axis OCT, towards a practical implementation for imaging skin. The proposal builds on NSF supported work that demonstrated the principle of extended depth imaging in OCT. Currently, OCT is not widely used for skin imaging due to limited penetration depth and an inability to evaluate large enough tissue areas. The proposed work will address this shortcoming. First, we will build a new scanning system that will validate that the approach can be used to examine larger tissue areas yet penetrate deeply into biological tissues such as animal skin. Second, we will implement a new dynamic focusing approach that will enable commercial success by making allowing physicians to image tissues at several millimeters below the tissue surface without repositioning the device.   Finally, this proposal will demonstrate the medical applicability of the approach by imaging in vivo animal tissues.

In particular, vocational safety training using the latest robot and other technologies is imperative, as thousands of workers lose their job or die on the job each year due to accidents, unforeseen injuries, and lack of appropriate assessment and training.  The objective of this Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project is to develop iWork, a smart robot-based vocational assessment and intervention system to assess the physical, cognitive and collaboration skills of an industry worker while he/she performs a manufacturing tasks in a simulated industry setting and collaborating with a robot to do the task. The aim is to transform traditional vocational training and rehabilitation practices to an evidence-based and personalized system that can be used to (re)train, retain, and prepare workers for robotic factories of the future. The need for personalized vocational training, rehabilitation and accurate job-matching is essential to ensuring a strong manufacturing sector, vital to America's economic development and ability to innovate. The iWork service is ""smart"" because it can adjust and adapt to the individual's abilities as it assesses him/her and help decide on the type of tasks needed to test and train, based on the job's complexity, difficulty or familiarity to the worker.  The iWork system integrates human expert knowledge to overcome or compensate for detected worker constraints. 
Research has shown that robot trainers can increase motivation and sustain interest, increase compliance and learning, and provide training for specific and individual needs. The iWork system aims to assess and train both the human and the work-assistive robot, as they collaborate on a manufacturing job.  The projected outcome is low-cost vocational training solutions that can have substantial economic and societal benefits to diverse economic sectors. Most importantly, if successful, projected outcomes could impact how millions of persons seeking a manufacturing job are trained, including those facing a type of learning, physical or aging disability. The system's mobile, low cost methods accelerate recognizing a worker's specific needs and improve the ability of the vocational expert to make correlations between cognitive and physical assessments, thus empowering traditional practices with user-centric targeted training methods. In addition, the project's robot-based emphasis on safety and risk assessment, can reduce liability costs and productivity setbacks faced by industry, due to manufacturing accidents. 
The iWork system uses computational methods in reinforcement (machine) learning, data mining, collaborative filtering and human robot interaction to collect and analyze multi-sensing worker data during a manufacturing human-robot collaboration simulation. Data collected and analyzed come from sensors, wearables, and explicit user feedback measuring worker movements, eye gazes, errors made, performance delays, human-robot interactions, physiological metrics, and others, depending on the task. The system has a closed loop architecture composed of four phases: assessment, recommendation, intervention (or adjustment), and evaluation, with a human expert in the loop. The system generates recommendations for personalized interventions to the expert, at different loop intervals. Use of the latest developments in sensing technologies, robotics and intelligent communications, assess the ability to enhance the intelligence of a robot co-worker with more human-like learning and collaboration abilities to support the human in achieving a task.  The system is modular and customizable to a particular manufacturing task, domain or worker robot. Two types of robots are used, socially assistive robots that provide non-contact user assistance through feedback and physically assistive robots that provide cognitive, physical and collaboration skill training. To predict risks of injury due to inattention, age, vision, or physical and mental issues, motion analysis and kinematics experiments are conducted to determine the type of safety training needed, to assess how well a human interacts with a collaborative robot, and how best to train the robot to help the human overcome identified physical and other deficiencies in performing a given task. The project integrates three main areas of expertise, engineered service system design, where assistive robots interact with and train each other to collaborate; computing, sensing, and information technologies, where machine learning, data mining and recommender algorithms are used to identify behavioral patterns of interest, and recommend targeted interventions; and human factors and cognitive engineering that deploy methods from the team's expertise in workplace assessment, personalized psychiatric intervention, and evaluation methods of vocational satisfaction, work habits, work quality, etc., as they relate to job preparation and retention.
The project has an interdisciplinary team of experts from two collaborating universities, University of Texas Arlington (UTA) and Yale University, representing several fields, including human factors, psychology, computing, and industrial organization. The project deploys two primary industry partners, SoftBank Robotics (San Francisco, CA) manufacturer of humanoid service robots, and InteraXon (Canada), producing mobile EEG devices, who provides hardware, software and know-how to enhance iWork's functionality in cognitive activity monitoring. The broader context partners include, C8Sciences (USA), Assistive Technology Resources (USA), Barrett Technologies Inc. (USA), and the Dallas Veteran Affairs Research Corp. (USA).","Kuanar, S and Athitsos, V and Pradhan, N and Mishra, A and Rao, K.R.~Cognitive Analysis of Working Memory Load from EEG, by a Deep Recurrent Neural Network~IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing~~2018~~~~10070194~ ~10070194~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.786000000, Abujelala, Maher and Gupta, Sanika and Makedon, Fillia~A Collaborative Assembly Task to Assess Worker Skills in Robot Manufacturing Environments~Proceedings of the 11th PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments Conference~~2018~~~10.1145/3197768.3203171~10070188~118 to 119~10070188~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.673000000, Papakostas, Michalis and Tsiakas, Konstantinos and Giannakopoulos, Theodoros and Makedon, Fillia~Towards predicting task performance from EEG signals~2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)~~2017~~~10.1109/BigData.2017.8258478~10070181~4423 to 4425~10070181~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.750000000, Theofanidis, Michail and Cloud, Joe and Babu, Ashwin Ramesh and Brady, James and Makedon, Fillia~A Human Robot Interaction Framework for Robotic Motor Skill Learning~Proceedings of the 11th PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments Conference on - PETRA '18~~2018~~~10.1145/3197768.3197790~10070189~110 to 111~10070189~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.776000000, Babu, Ashwin Ramesh and Cloud, Joe and Theofanidis, Michail and Makedon, Fillia~Facial Expressions as a Modality for Fatigue detection in Robot based Rehabilitation~Proceedings of the 11th PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments Conference on - PETRA '18~~2018~~~10.1145/3197768.3203168~10070185~112 to 113~10070185~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.703000000, Xiang, Wei and Zhang, Dong-Qing and Yu, Heather and Athitsos, Vassilis~Context-Aware Single-Shot Detector~2018 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)~~2018~~~10.1109/wacv.2018.00198~10070190~1784 to 1793~10070190~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.740000000, Tsiakas, Konstantinos and Abujelala, Maher and Rajavenkatanarayanan, Akilesh and Makedon, Fillia~User Skill Assessment Using Informative Interfaces for Personalized Robot-Assisted Training~International Conference on Learning and Collaboration Technologies~~2018~~~10.1007/978-3-319-91152-6_7~10070186~88-98~10070186~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.683000000, Gattupalli, Srujana and Babu, Ashwin Ramesh and Brady, James Robert and Makedon, Fillia and Athitsos, Vassilis~Towards Deep Learning based Hand Keypoints Detection for Rapid Sequential Movements from RGB Images~Proceedings of the 11th PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments Conference on - PETRA '18~~2018~~~10.1145/3197768.3201538~10070187~31 to 37~10070187~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.766000000, Tsiakas, Konstantinos and Abujelala, Maher and Makedon, Fillia~Task Engagement as Personalization Feedback for Socially-Assistive Robots and Cognitive Training~Technologies~6~2018~~~10.3390/technologies6020049~10070179~49~10070179~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.643000000, Rajavenkatanarayanan, Akilesh and Babu, Ashwin Ramesh and Tsiakas, Konstantinos and Makedon, Fillia~Monitoring task engagement using facial expressions and body postures~Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Interactive and Spatial Computing - IWISC '18~~2018~~~10.1145/3191801.3191816~10070182~103 to 108~10070182~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.726000000, Tsiakas, Konstantinos and Karkaletsis, Vangelis and Makedon, Fillia~A Taxonomy in Robot-Assisted Training: Current Trends, Needs and Challenges~Proceedings of the 11th PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments Conference on - PETRA '18~~2018~~~10.1145/3197768.3197787~10070183~208 to 213~10070183~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.730000000, Miao, Xin and Xiantong, Zhen and Xianglong, Liu and Cheng, Deng and Vassilis, Athitsos and Heng, Huang~Direct Shape Regression Networks for End-to-End Face Alignment~Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition~~2018~~~~10070191~ ~10070191~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.636000000, Papakostas, Michalis and Tsiakas, Konstantinos and Abujelala, Maher and Bell, Morris and Makedon, Fillia~v-CAT: A Cyberlearning Framework for Personalized Cognitive Skill Assessment and Training~Proceedings of the 11th PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments Conference on - PETRA '18~~2018~~~10.1145/3197768.3201545~10070184~570 to 574~10070184~OSTI~02/07/2020 14:21:41.696000000",,,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS

With the lack of alternative solutions available, robotics could become a welcomed approach for assisting farmers and farm workers with mobility limitations and strength deficits. This award leverages an interdisciplinary academe-industry partnership to jointly develop flexible robotic systems that are designed to be wear by farmers with mobility limitations to assist them in performing activities of daily living. The research team's goal is not only to adapt state-of-the-art flexible robotics technology to the needs of farmers with mobility limitations, but also to educate stakeholders regarding the availability and role of assistive technology to augment their performance at work and improve their quality of life. In particular, the funded effort consists of a combination of 1) technology development in order to take out-of-the-box flexible robotics technology and make it suitable to this particular population; 2) development of a test bed which will allow for technology testing in typical daily activities; 3) coordination of a service delivery system to provide education, health-based agricultural resources, and community-based services  addressing  life and farm-based goals of farm workers and farm families. 

The research team aims at demonstrating a new use of flexible robotics for the care of farmers and farm workers while performing their daily activities. The investigators will advance knowledge on the actual design of wearable robots (both hardware and software) that can perform a set of tasks to facilitate farmer's mobility and decrease the possibility of secondary injuries. Specifically, the researchers will develop modules to support the back, knee, and hand and assist with motion of these joints. The research plan includes understanding the motions and activities typically performed by farmers, designing the robotic modules to be comfortable and compatible with being worn daily; understanding the user inputs and adapting control algorithms that will enable the robotic modules to best assist with their wearers' mobility; add and study the impact of flex-sensors and force sensors into the structure of some modules. Additionally, motion information collected by the system will help create a data-driven health monitoring system whereby health service providers could understand how a patient's mobility is changing over time.  Undergraduate students will be involved in supplementing graduate student work, in interactions with client farming communities, and in ground-level activities aimed at educating the public in innovative, assistive technologies for people with disabilities. The PFI project plan for educational outreach includes several activities such as summer camps, senior design capstone design experiences, and service learning opportunities for engineering and agriculture students.

The lead institution is Virginia Tech with faculty from Mechanical Engineering, Agricultural Leadership, and Community Education, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Engineering Education and the Virginia Cooperative Extension.  The primary industrial partners are TORC Robotics (small business, Blacksburg, VA), and Total Motion Physical Therapy (small business, Blacksburg, VA) together with two nonprofit broader context partners, AgrAbility Virginia (nonprofit, Salem, VA) and Easter Seals UCP (United Cerebral Palsy, Salem, VA). It is expected that this partnership will have broader impacts across the National AgrAbility community where engineers, service providers, and industry professionals collaborate to assist injured or disabled farmers in their respective states. In addition, AgrAbility Virginia will provide the means for education, evaluation, and farmer participation in the system design. The synergy of all the institutions involved in this project will facilitate the translation of research and education outcomes to the broad community of farmers.","Upasani, Satyajit and Franco, Roberto and Niewolny, Kim and Srinivasan, Divya~The Potential for Exoskeletons to Improve Health and Safety in Agriculture?Perspectives from Service Providers~IISE Transactions on Occupational Ergonomics and Human Factors~~2019~~~10.1080/24725838.2019.1575930~10104541~1 to 8~10104541~OSTI~15/07/2019 13:01:47.833000000",,,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND STATE UNIVERSITY

These materials are important because they address a clinical problem (IVD degeneration) that is the most common diagnosis for lower back pain, a debilitating condition that affects 15-30% of the United States population, with associated annual costs of $100 billion. The project will result in valuable proof-of-concept data demonstrating safety and efficacy of these cellulosic biomaterials in a small animal in vivo model and a large animal explant model. Successful completion will motivate further validation in a large animal preclinical injury model prior to clinical studies. The cellulosic materials are unique in that they are plant-derived, gel in situ via a dual coupling mechanism and allow for the incorporation of cells and growth factors for combination therapies. ?These features provide the advantages of an extensive safety profile, cost effectiveness, minimally invasive delivery, enhanced stability and therapeutic versatility when compared to the leading competing?materials under development in this market space. ?

This project addresses several technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application of a novel material for IVD repair.  Current surgical treatment options (i.e., discectomy) are inadequate for long-term disease management, and existing commercial implants (i.e., total disc replacement) do not sufficiently restore disc structure and function. Replacing the gelatinous nucleus pulposus tissue of the IVD with an injectable material may help restore IVD mechanical functionality. Several products are under development for nucleus pulposus replacement, with none approved for use in the United States. This project focuses on the use of injectable cellulose-based hydrogels that form in situ in the intradiscal space to replace resected nucleus pulposus tissue. The proposed validation experiments will characterize an optimized cellulosic gel formulation previously shown to be stable and restore disc properties under axial compression.   The studies will determine the foreign body reaction in a small animal model as well as the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms under cyclic loading in bending using a large animal spine motion segment injury model.  Many of the competing products under development have been found to have poor biocompatibility or exhibited migration and reherniation. Also, few prior studies have been capable of evaluating candidate materials under such ""worst-case-scenario"" bending conditions.  As such, they have met with limited success. 

In addition, personnel involved in this project include undergraduate and graduate students who will receive training in innovation and technology commercialization through translational medicine courses, and via regular interactions with potential strategic partners, participation in innovation and commercialization conferences and symposia, and small business grant proposal preparation.

The intellectual merit of this work has provided experimental methods for evaluating the biocompatibility and complex mechanical behaviors of injectable soft tissue implant materials, particularly those intended for use in the spine.  The materials were found to be biocompatible but did not restore mechanical properties of injured discs to intact values and were not superior to the current clinical standard of nucleotomy.  Therefore, additional formulations were developed to increase swelling of the hydrogel to improve intradiscal retention and to sequester soluble proteins that promote tissue healing.  Also, a cellulose-based glue was engineered for the purpose of sealing tears and ruptures in the disc to prevent reherniation.  Although the original biomaterial formulation was not optimal for IVD repair, a component of the mixture was explored for use in soft tissue augmentation in plastic surgery.  This cellulosic material demonstrated excellent stability over 6 months in vivo and a mild foreign body reaction.  The findings from these combined studies were disseminated at national scientific meetings and translational research symposia, and resulted in two peer-reviewed manuscripts and an issued patent, with more pending.

 

Apart from the potential clinical benefit to society, the broader impacts include training of undergraduate and graduate students in research methods in chemical synthesis and biomaterials fabrication and characterization. Moreover, the students received instruction in innovation and technology commercialization through translational medicine courses, and via interactions with potential strategic partners. This training was directly responsible for students gaining employment opportunities in biotechnology consulting firms and biomaterials design companies upon graduation.

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it  translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The  high throughput protein analysis methods of proteomics are having a  profound effect on the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, as  well as academia All of these proteomics applications require robust,  repeatable and automatable sample prep methods. Currently, these methods  are mostly ad hoc. The lack of the standardized methods leads to  frequent experimental failure and unreliable results, which requires  many rounds of experimental repeats, costing time and money.  Standardized protein sample prep methods will provide significant  workflow savings and improved time to market, as well as bolster quality  control and consumer products.

*Peptides are protein sub-fragments that are routinely used for  proteomics analysis. Some proteomics experiments require purified  protein samples, while others require purified peptide samples.



Our goals were to produce two new  reagents: (1) a reversible protein tag that can be covalently coupled to  beads, and (2) develop high capacity beads to minimize the amount of  beads required for protein/peptide cleanup. We have completed the  sysnthesis and testing of the protein/peptide capture tag. The beads to  which couple the tag has sufficient capacity so that there is no longer a  need to develop ultra-high capacity beads.

Once these reagents were synthesized, we tested their efficacy. Our  method has equalled or surpassed our proposed milestones. We are able to  capture and release &gt;85% of input protein or peptide. We are able to  remove all salts, nucleic acids and detergents.

Finally, we have begun beta-testing of our kits with collaborators. Mass spectrometry of peptide samples show that our kit outperforms our competitors.

The Federal Aviation Administration forecasts sales of seven million drones in 2020 following recent regulations allowing routine use of drones in the national airspace. While a vast majority of drone operators will likely follow the regulations and drones will be successfully monitored, non-cooperative drones or drones that have lost communication with their operators, will pose a significant threat to airport facilities where no intrusions should be allowed on the air field, critical infrastructure such as military bases or power reactors, and stadiums and arenas where drones can disrupt activities, endanger lives and cause economic losses. These facilities also risk similar outcomes when severe weather unexpectedly disrupts operations. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of a single radar-based surveillance system that can simultaneously provide early warning of drone intrusions and impending severe weather. The development of a multi-function surveillance system with multiple applications, could help make installations economical, with the costs shared between various agencies in new public-private partnership models of infrastructure acquisition, operations and data sharing.

This project proposes the use of dual polarized phased array radars that can conduct rapid electronic scanning of the atmosphere to identify and discriminate between different hard targets such as micro-drones and birds and atmospheric targets such as hydrometeors, whose characteristics help determine the type of weather. This project will help develop an understanding of dual polarization radar signatures of various micro-drones, signal processing algorithms that help distinguish such targets from clutter in the low atmosphere, and new tracking algorithms tuned to the 'stop, hover and rapidly accelerate' movement of micro-drones. While the use of phased array radars to track severe weather has already resulted in early commercial prototypes, this project will result in design and operational strategies to conduct micro-drone and weather surveillance using the same system.

Graduate students involved in this project will benefit from direct interaction with industry stakeholders and end users such as airport managers. This includes industry mentoring and participation in commercialization activities such as patent searches, intellectual property protection, and participation in business plan competitions. Teams of undergraduate students will be involved in systems engineering activities. The proof of concept demonstration to potential investors, manufacturers and customers, will lead to the specification of user requirements, development of commercial prototypes and eventually tenders and sales that result in installations. Partners includes firms such as Raytheon Company and Scientific Systems Company, Inc. that will help guide commercialization activities and end users such as Dallas Fort Worth International Airport that will provide end user needs and validate the proof-of-concept demonstration results.

This project is jointly funded by the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships and the Division of Engineering Education; reflecting the alignment of this project with the respective goals of the two divisions and their programs.",,,"This PFI: AIR Technology Transfer project demonstrated that low-power, dual-polarized pulse Doppler weather radars can be used for the detection and tracking of small unmanned aerial vehicles. Algorithms were developed for the automated detection, classification and tracking of drones based on the identification of the micro-Doppler signature characteristics of copter-type targets. The techniques were shown to work well for a variety of 4 rotor and 6 rotor drones flown at a distance of one kilometer during multiple field campaigns. In addition, the project addressed additional weather-related challeges for drone and air taxi operations by incorporating traditional manned aviation weather sources (such as airport surface stations) and development of techniques to identify precise locations of weather hazards (from weather radar data) for drone weather alerting products.

Progress towards commercialization. Findings from this project were published and presented to the weather radar community and the drone industry. The proof-of-concept demonstration resulted in further prototype development with a participating company and sponsored research to bring the product to market. It resulted in new demonstration project with a drone vehicle manufacturer and NASA. Finally, it established CASA as an important testbed for supporting local drone projects in Massachusetts.   

Broader Impacts. The success of future drone and air taxi services depends on safety and efficency of operations. This project demonstrates that a network of low-power, short-range radars could be used to support such operations in two important ways - to provide important low altitude weather observations and to detect and discriminate hazards such as birds and non-cooperative drones. It showed the importance of incorporating traditional and non-traditional weather data sources into weather-related decision making. The project engaged one postdoctoral student, two graduate students and two undergraduate students in the research. The postdoctoral student was hired by a counter-drone services company, one of the graduate students was hired by a research laboratory and one of the undergraduate students was hired by a defense contractor. The project had a significant outreach effort that included engagement of K-12 students, a senior design project, research experience for undergraduates, a graduate-level systems engineering class, media coverage, poster sessions and conference and trade show participation.

Thus, a sensor is needed in applications requiring or containing hydrogen such as fuel cells, some batteries, hydrogen powered vehicles, etc. 

This project will result in a prototype handheld device that combines the sensor chip with a digital meter for direct readout of test results; the H2 sensor chip is also adaptable to batteries, fuel cells, and existing air quality monitoring equipment for real-time H2 detection. This NC-RGO sensor chip has the following unique features: rapid response for real-time monitoring, micron-sized dimensions, high sensitivity, scalable fabrication, and wireless communication compatibility. Compared to current hydrogen sensors in the marketplace, these features provide fast response, superior sensitivity/selectivity, portability, low-cost, and facile connection with smart phones/devices. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The NC-RGO sensing platform will be further improved in order to realize the low-cost, reliable, ultrasensitive H2 detection for various applications (e.g., H2 fuel cells, vehicles, lead-acid batteries, and air quality monitoring for indoor spaces) associated with H2. Various sensor characteristics will be investigated and validated, including sensor sensitivity, selectivity, long-term stability, performance in different operating conditions (e.g., various humidity values), and calibration methods. Insights into the NC-RGO sensing platform will advance the understanding of the interaction mechanism between gas molecules and low-dimensional materials in hybrid structures. Such understanding can further contribute to the design of nanomaterials with desirable properties to identify active sites and rates of catalytic reactions on metal/metal oxide NCs and to provide guidelines for performance enhancement through engineering properties of NCs. In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduates (including underrepresented students) and graduate students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship training experiences through interacting with industrial partners and additional entrepreneurship training through I-Corps.

Project Outcome Report

 

Hydrogen (H2) is an important clean fuel for future energy applications, but potential hydrogen leak may trigger explosion under appropriate conditions. Existing approaches for H2 detection have serious disadvantages (e.g., relying on the laboratory framework, frequent and costly maintenance, and unsuitability for in-situ detection) and cannot meet the leak detection and safety features required for the widespread use of hydrogen. This project focuses on translating a sensing platform to fill the need for a low-cost, fast, and ultra-sensitive sensor chip for H2 detection. We have improved the hydrogen sensing performance of our platform in sensitivity and the speed of response and recovery. Specifically, we have demonstrated the use of gold nanoparticles on the sensor surface to tune the H2 sensor performance, and investigated the effect of gold nanoparticles on accelerating H2 adsorption and desorption through activation energy reduction. Based on the enhanced sensing platform, we have successfully fabricated a prototype handheld device for H2 detection with a good accuracy. The handheld device combines the sensor chip with a digital meter (portable, battery-powered) for direct readout of test results. A journal manuscript is under preparation and will be ready to submit for publication soon. This project also trained one graduate student on nanomaterial synthesis and characterization, fabrication and characterization of nanomaterial-based gas sensors

OCT has been widely used in ophthalmic clinics as a standard diagnostic tool for diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, glaucoma, and other retinal and corneal diseases. Label-free OCT angiography is important because it demonstrates promising features over traditional fluorescein angiography, which requires intravenous injection of fluorescein dye that may lead to various complications.  OCT angiography is completely noninvasive, does not involve the risks of exogenous dye injection, and is capable of providing depth-resolved information about vascular structures down to the capillary level.  The project will result in a clinical prototype of a wide-field OCT angiography system with 16 parallel imaging channels. This prototype system will enable high-definition, wide field OCT angiography over a 12 mm ? 12 mm region of the retina, which is comparable to the field-of-view of standard fluorescein angiography.  An entire 3D wide-field OCT angiography image of the retina can be obtained in less than two seconds, avoiding any motion artifacts or blinking of the patient's eyes. These features provide significant improvement in terms of imaging speed and wide-field of view when compared to the leading commercial OCT angiography systems in this market space.  

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Although the principle of parallel OCT imaging has been demonstrated in laboratory settings, a clinical prototype capable of imaging human eyes has not been available. This project focuses on developing hardware and software solutions for space-division multiplexing OCT in order to enable functional OCT imaging (e.g. angiography) of human eyes, and testing its feasibility in clinical settings.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, graduate students, post-doctoral associates and clinical fellows, will receive technical and entrepreneurship training experiences through multidisciplinary research activities. 

The project engages Dr. Alexander Brucker at the Scheie Eye Institute of the University of Pennsylvania to demonstrate clinical feasibility of the proposed technology in human patients. Successful demonstration of clinical feasibility is an important step in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.","Huang, Yongyang and Zou, Jinyun and Badar, Mudabbir and Liu, Junchao and Shi, Wentao and Wang, Shunqiang and Guo, Qiongyu and Wang, Xiaofang and Kessel, Sarah and Chan, Leo Li-Ying and Li, Peter and Liu, Yaling and Qiu, Jean and Zhou, Chao~Longitudinal Morphological and Physiological Monitoring of Three-dimensional Tumor Spheroids Using Optical Coherence Tomography~Journal of Visualized Experiments~~2019~~~10.3791/59020~10128600~ ~10128600~OSTI~26/12/2019 17:01:51.670000000, Shi, Wentao and Kwon, Jean and Huang, Yongyang and Tan, Jifu and Uhl, Christopher G. and He, Ran and Zhou, Chao and Liu, Yaling~Facile Tumor Spheroids Formation in Large Quantity with Controllable Size and High Uniformity~Scientific Reports~8~2018~~~10.1038/s41598-018-25203-3~10073679~ ~10073679~OSTI~30/08/2018 13:01:47.50000000, Huang, Yongyang and Wang, Shunqiang and Guo, Qiongyu and Kessel, Sarah and Rubinoff, Ian and Chan, Leo Li-Ying and Li, Peter and Liu, Yaling and Qiu, Jean and Zhou, Chao~Optical coherence tomography detects necrotic regions and volumetrically quantifies multicellular tumor spheroids~Cancer research~~2017~~~~10038722~ ~10038722~OSTI~31/08/2018 11:05:25.370000000, Huang, Yongyang and Badar, Mudabbir and Nitkowski, Arthur and Weinroth, Aaron and Tansu, Nelson and Zhou, Chao~Wide-field high-speed space-division multiplexing optical coherence tomography using an integrated photonic device~Biomedical Optics Express~8~2017~~~10.1364/BOE.8.003856~10038723~3856~10038723~OSTI~31/08/2018 11:05:25.373000000",,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging biomedical imaging technology that enables noninvasive micron&#8209;scale, cross&#8209;sectional, and three-dimensional (3D) imaging of biological tissues.  OCT has been widely used in ophthalmic clinics as a standard diagnostic tool for diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, glaucoma, and other retinal and corneal diseases.  This PFI-AIR-TT award supported our team to develop an ultrahigh speed OCT technology, called space-division multiplexing OCT (SDM-OCT), for wide-field ophthalmic imaging. Intellectual merit: Three major progresses were made in this program. 1) We developed photonic chip based SDM-OCT technologies, which resulted in a new patent application. 2) A prototype SDM-OCT device was developed for clinical use. 3) In collaboration with colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, we have evaluated the performance of the ophthalmic prototype system in healthy volunteers and in patients with retinal diseases. A high definition 3D volumetric scan of the human retina, covering a wide field of 12 mm x 7.5 mm range can be acquired in 1 second. The acquisition speed of our prototype system is at least 10x faster than most commercial OCT devices on the market. The high acquisition speed significantly reduced motion artifacts in cube scan OCT images. Furthermore, the ultrahigh speed imaging capability allows us to pick up minor disease in the peripheral retina, allowing early detection of retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Broader Impact: The technology developed in this program and clinical feasibility demonstration have generated interest from ophthalmologists as well as ophthalmic OCT manufactures, facilitating the translation of the SDM-OCT technology from our laboratory to the market to improve patient care. Several students, including both graduate and undergraduate students, were involved in various aspect of the project and received extensive training in technology development, clinical validation, and entrepreneurship.

This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project seeks to enable a next generation residential energy market that will reduce consumers' costs, increase the flexibility of the electric grid to integrate renewable energy of all types and sizes  -- roof top solar to large scale wind farms -- while increasing the robustness of electricity delivery. This project will test whether adding rechargeable batteries (electric storage) to individual smart meters will turn these potential benefits into reality. This research leverages a new Energy Smart Community (ESC), comprised of 12,000 smart meters and a wireless data network in the Ithaca NY area deployed in response to New York State?s Reforming the Energy Vision strategy. The network of 12 thousand homes equipped with smart meters will become the test bed for this project. Researchers, working with the primary partners, will actively engage residential customers in the design of the smart service system and involve consumers in the testing and optimization of the virtual storage systems.  A smart service system will control when the battery charges (purchases electricity from the grid) and when it discharges (avoiding purchasing electricity from the grid) allowing the thus far unrealized savings for consumers, while creating potential new business opportunities and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The resulting smart service system will be highly marketable and readily transferable to other communities and utilities throughout the United States and the world. This project is an integrated collaboration that is uncommon for universities. It engages a regulated utility, for-profit corporations, venture investors, residential community members and government agencies with a shared intent to bring solutions to the market at scale. This team will develop the smart service system infrastructure that will allow the retail energy market considered crucial to 21st century power distribution, to emerge. 

A signature of this project is the use of computer models to simulate residential batteries, which may be either stand-alone or contained within an electric vehicle, allowing researchers to test situations where most residential homes have a battery without the cost or challenges of purchasing and installing them. A small number of homes will be outfitted with real batteries to ensure the computer models accurately capture how real batteries function. Five cross-disciplinary and cross-organizational tasks will leverage the team's skill sets: (1) Develop and test a unique experimental economics platform that will guide the design of market mechanisms that focus on customer-based distributed storage and generation capacity in electricity distribution systems, (2) Design, implement, and test a fully instrumented, control and communication capable, prototype smart service system at the individual residence level, (3) Develop virtual storage simulation modeling tools to integrate into the ESC advanced metering infrastructure (smart meters) to enable the efficient testing of different time-varying rate scenarios at low cost, (4) Design, implement, and analyze cross-disciplinary survey and focus group efforts to understand, engage, and collect feedback from the consumer, and (5) Carry out customer choice and consumer incentivization research.

There are nearly three million registered nurses employed in the United States, making them the largest pool of healthcare providers in the country. Technology that affects the performance of this large labor pool cannot fail to have impact. Due to advancements in robotics and computer technology, access to intelligent communication, sensing, and computing hardware is on the cusp of becoming common--not only for healthcare professionals, but also for patients themselves. The project led by The University of Kentucky at Louisville in collaboration with the University of Texas at Arlington will focus on the creation of new design tools that can configure the hardware and software of adaptive robotic nursing assistants (ARNA). ARNA will be specifically designed to assist nurses in healthcare facilities with simple tasks such as, lift assistance, delivery of everyday lightweight objects (medicine, medical wearable equipment), and some physical assistance with movement of heavier objects, such as furniture, gurneys, and the patients themselves. The design and engineering innovations resulting from insights gained in this project may have great value deployed as products in broader consumer markets in addition to hospitals. Examples include in-home service and assistive robots, robots for assistance in public venues, and co-Robot manufacturing where humans are in close proximity to robot workers. The improved understanding of human-robot and nurse-robot interaction could represent enabling technology that will facilitate research breakthroughs and increase productivity and social acceptance of robotics. The research will also advance the understanding of the perceptual effects of robot design aesthetics and interfaces.

The proposed Adaptive Robotic Nurse Assistants will navigate cluttered hospitals, while equipped with multi-modal skin sensors that can anticipate nurse intent, automate mundane low-level tasks, but keep nurses in the decision loop. Modular and strong hardware will be deployed in reconfigurable platforms specially designed for nurse physical assistance. Adaptive human-machine interfaces will play a key role in this project, as these interfaces directly impact the ability of robots to help nurses in a dynamic, unstructured environment. Rather than pre-programming robot behaviors,  learning algorithms will be used so that robots adapt to human preferences. Two leading applications are envisioned for feasibility evaluation by quantitative and qualitative metrics, including patient sitters and walkers. The sitter robot will take vital sign measurements, evaluate risk from patient movement and pose, and provide continuous observation of patients and feedback to and from nurses. The walker robot will assist nurses and patients by providing partial balance support, navigating cluttered environments, and assisting with medical equipment transportation.

These robotic treatment scenarios involved Patient Sitting (vital sign monitoring, object fetching, informational exchange) and Patient Walking (assisted walking alongside the robot while carrying medical equipment). The participating companies were an integral part of the hardware and software development process: RE2 designed and built a collaborative lightweight robotic arm, QNA provides insight into the robotic base platform, while THR provided requirements for the two nursing scenarios considered in our project.  

The research team developed several novel hardware and software tools and devices, including the Adaptive Robotic Nursing Assistant (ARNA), pressure sensitive robotic skins, neuroadaptive controllers (NAC), and adaptive interfaces for teleoperation. The project supported the completion of 2 Ph.D. dissertations and 4 M.S. theses at UTA and UofL, and also supported 10 undergraduate researchers over the four year duration of the project. It resulted in a dozen Journal and Conference Publications and 4 patents filed jointly by UofL and UTA on robotic skins, adaptive interfaces and the ARNA robot. During the course of the project, we evaluated the commercialization potential of the ARNA robot in collaboration with an ICORPS Site project at UofL, and a start-up company is planned in the near future to translate this technology into the private sector.

Experimental results were carried out at UT Arlington Research Institute using a PR-2 robot in the first three years of the project while the ARNA robot was being designed and built. The final testing under IRB of the ARNA robot was carried out at the School of Nursing (SoN) at UofL. Experiment under IRB with using 48 human subject nursing students were conducted in two Phases during Spring 2019. Preliminary data collected and analyzed indicates that nurses are excited that new robot technology can be deployed to help them with mundane physical tasks in hospitals. Nurses are also excited that they can focus on value added, more analytical tasks, while highly attentive patient care is still maintained. Our results also suggest that patient walkers with adjustable response stiffness may be useful to nurses and patient recovery during future hospital operation of the robot. And, more automation of fetching tasks during patient sitting will allow successful operation for users with limited game controller experience. 

A high quality video news release featuring the ARNA robot and documenting the experimental testing procedures was developed by Science Nation and shared with the NSF community in Fall 2019.

The development of reactive inks for solar cells is important because of the savings incurred by reducing the total amount of precious silver and also because the outstanding electrical properties these inks have shown can significantly enhance photovoltaic performance while reducing the overall cost of solar energy. 

The project will result in a proof-of-concept demonstration that reactive silver inks can replace costly high temperature pastes and low-temperature nanoparticle pastes in solar cell metallization. This reactive silver ink has the following unique features: resistivity comparable to metallic silver, 3.7 micro-ohm-cm, and contact resistances of 1.8 ohm-cm2 on silicon heterojunction cells, even when printed below 90?C. These features enable solar cell field factor (FF) higher than 70% and Power conversion Efficiencies higher than 18%, with much finer control of the finger width and silver consumptions an order of magnitude lower when compared to the state-of-the-art solar cell heterojunction market space.  

This project addresses the following technology gap as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The further reduction of the contact resistance to values below 1.2 ohm-cm2 is required to propel solar cell efficiencies above 20%. The project will approach this by optimizing the ink chemistry and developing adhesion promoters. While SiO2 particles could be easily incorporated like traditional silver pastes do to enhance adhesion, these glass frits require high temperatures (>350 deg. C) to form Ohmic contact. The proposed project will look into implementing Sn- and Sn/Pd-based promoters, commonly used in electrochemical and electroless deposition of noble metals on polymers and oxide surfaces. The goal is to print the entire metallization layer, metal plus the adhesion promoter. This reduces capital equipment costs, speeds production, simplifies synthesis, and reduces metal contamination across the cell.

In addition, personnel involved in this project, two graduate students, will receive hands-on experience developing products for commercial applications while working closely with industry partners.  They will also receive technology transfer experience by learning about Phase I SBIR funding opportunities and other entrepreneurial training through the Arizona Technology Transfer Office.

The project engages two important partners: Techniq Inc. (advanced metallization experts) and Simplexity Product Design (printer designers) to allow for pilot testing environment, guided commercialization and the joint development of high throughput, low cost capital equipment.","?

As part of the AIR-TT program, we are directly targeting questions related to the rapid commercialization of the technology.   The goal of this project is to develop the fundamental understanding necessary to adapt new reactive ink metallization technologies for photovoltaic applications.  As part of this work, we identified the adhesion failure modes for printed reacitve silver inks on transparent conductive electrodes and developed new ink recipes to bypass these identified issues.  With these new recipes, we are now able to print low-cost silver inks that will meet the reliability requirements for indutrial applications (such as photovoltaic cells).

Theintellectual property, knowledge, science, and process validation developed through this work we demosntrated to reduce silver consumption for photovoltaic cells by 90%.  Excluding the wafer, silver electrodes contribute 30% of the consumable cost of a solar cell &ndash; replacing screen printed pastes with reactive inks could reduce cell costs from $0.14/W to $0.10/W.  This important technology means that photovoltaic manufacturers in the United States will exceed the 2026 International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic (ITRPV) goal by a factor of 4 (i.e. we are already better than where the industry wants to be 8 years from now). This technology could save the photovoltaics industry ~$12 billion/year, with savings expected to be passed onto the consumer.   This technology is currently being commercialized by a company founded by the researchers.

The hydrothermal reactor technology will be applied to the production of nanomaterials for use in water quality testing sensors. Current production of nanomaterials is dominated by batch synthesis techniques, which lack reproducibility, are often poorly scalable, and are inefficient. These limitations present a barrier to industrial production and use of nanomaterials. The continuous flow hydrothermal reactor technology can address these limitations by providing a system capable of rapid scalable production of nanomaterials with high precision, significantly reduced waste relative to conventional batch processes, reduction or elimination of harmful organic solvents, and fully integrated one-step production. 

One of the most important resources of a healthy civilization and environment is the availability of clean water. Trace water testing represents a significant societal benefit by allowing water quality issues to be understood and correctly addressed before public health is affected. However, existing trace water quality testing typically relies on slow and expensive analysis methods, which decreases the availability of routine testing. Sensors based on surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) have the potential to provide a rapid and inexpensive test for trace level contaminants, making testing of potable, natural, and industrial process waters much more available. The effectiveness of these chemical sensors is critically dependent on the quality and reproducibility of the nanomaterials used in their manufacture. This project will apply the advantages of the continuous flow hydrothermal reactor technology to the manufacture of various nanomaterials for water quality testing sensors in order to increase particle quality and reproducibility, improve production efficiency (by reducing cost, waste, and synthesis time), and improve sensor performance. At the conclusion of this project, a fully integrated scalable pilot reactor system will be constructed and optimized for the production of various sensor nanomaterials. 

This PFI : AIR TT project addresses technology gaps related to the scalable reactor design, optimized synthesis chemistry, and inline coating as the technology translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Based on industry requirements and the unique capabilities of the continuous flow hydrothermal reactor technology, the synthesis chemistry and reactor materials will be tailored to maximize the precision, quality, and size range of the product particles. Studies on the growth kinetics, reactor design criteria, and reactor construction will be conducted to determine optimal reactor design parameters for scalability and production of the particles of interest. Optimization of the online particle characterization and determination of process control parameters will occur. Finally, the inline surface modification system will be developed to complete the fully integrated reactor system and allow for single step production of sensor particles. 

In collaboration with OndaVia Technologies, a company with expertise in water quality sensing and SERS sensor technology, nanomaterials will be incorporated into sensor cartridges for evaluation. Personnel involved in this project, including one graduate student and at least three undergraduate students, will gain innovation, technology transfer, and entrepreneurship experiences through interactions with OndaVia Technologies and the UF Entrepreneurship & Innovation Center, and participation in the research activities.",,,"Significance of the Research Work
Reliable and robust sensors are vital to ensuring the monitoring of the quality of water as well as health parameters for the wellbeing of the society at large. Many such sensors require nanoparticles of gold and other metals that are precise in size. Currently, the cost of production of such particles can be in excess of ten thousand dollars per gram, driving the cost of monitoring devices. Hence, there is a critical need for a more economical particle production strategy. Accordingly, the aim of the current project is to develop a process that can produce particles of required specifications at a lower cost.

Intellectual Merit

One of the primary reasons for the high cost of production of precise gold nanoparticles is an inadequate understanding of the synthesis process. In this regard, further understanding of the nucleation and growth mechanisms of the gold nanoparticles has led to the development of the modular continuous flow reactor methodology in the current project. The project outcomes, upon further maturation, would lead to lower cost availability of the particles needed for the manufacturing of more reliable and robust sensors. The knowledge generated in the current project, especially related to the nucleation and growth mechanisms and the strategies to overcome reactor fouling have important implications for other disciplines such as physical chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. Additionally, high precision nanoparticle availability in larger quantities and at a lower cost is expected to further facilitate toxicological studies of nanoparticles &ndash; a critical need for developing technologies that are safe to humans and the environment alike. The availability of lower-cost nanoparticles of specifically engineered properties would enable further advances in sensors, medical imaging, and drug delivery applications.

Broader Impacts

In this project, a modular continuous flow reactor has been developed and successfully tested for pilot-scale production of precise gold nanoparticles. An added benefit of the developed methodology is that it employs less hazardous chemicals, thereby rendering the process to be greener than the conventional batch production methods. This NSF AIR-TT project has also trained and further enhanced the professional development of multiple graduate and undergraduate students of different disciplinary backgrounds, and underrepresented minority status. The knowledge generated in the present study will continue to be further communicated to the academic and industry researchers via written papers/reports and oral presentations.

The current project outcomes would lead to more economical manufacturing of precision nanoparticles for sensing and imaging applications. This will be achieved using smaller amounts and/or less hazardous chemicals. Ultimately, the present NSF AIR -TT project deliverables would result in more economical, robust and reliable monitoring of the environment and human health  &ndash; a major benefit to the society at large.

Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are prevalent in an estimated 6.6% of the national population. The market for sleep treatment is noted to exceed $23 billion per year, and is set to grow at over 15% annually.  However the current treatment procedures suffer from severe drawbacks and are highly criticized in consumer forums. Recent advancements in sensors and wireless communication offer an unprecedented opportunity for cost-effective home care options to treat sleep apnea. This project will result in a prototype of SleepEaze technology that captures this opportunity. This technology is based on using a wireless biometric sleepwear to monitor the apnea patient's biorhythms during sleep, and it employs a patent-pending algorithm to predict apnea events several minutes ahead of their onset. Then the muscles responsible for the obstruction can be stimulated when the event is predicted to be imminent (""nip in the bud""), allowing the patient a more restful sleep. The use of the innovative prediction algorithm as well as low power electronic elements offer a breakthrough in the noninvasive stimulations that can lead to a new class of affordable wearable devices for sleep apnea treatment with high commercialization potential.

This project plans to pursue three major objectives: (a) Technology Improvement, which includes: the refinement of the wearable sensor layout to enhance comfort, tuning of parameters of the prediction model based on nonparametric Dirichlet Process Mixture of Gaussian Process representations to reduce computational overhead associated with multi-step look ahead procedures, and optimization of the stimulation modality, location, and time-frequency stimulation profiles using a novel low power electronics to effectively avert sleep apnea  events; (b) Extended testing using an early prototype, extending an ongoing human subject study to benchmark signal quality, prediction and stimulation performance, and sleep quality improvement from the technology in preparation for approvals (510K) from the federal regulatory agencies; and (c) Prototyping of a updated wearable multi-sensor unit for real-time treatment of sleep apnea  episodes, as well as its testing and benchmarking. If successful, the proposed project will result in a functional, refined prototype of the SleepEaze device (hardware and associated software interface) that offers a radically new approach for OSA treatment. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a post-doctoral associate and two graduate students, will receive entrepreneurship experiences offered through Texas A&M University and the NSF Southwest I-Corps node.","T.

Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea are prevalent in an estimated 6.6% of the national population. The market for sleep treatment is noted to exceed $23 billion per year, and is set to grow at over 15% annually.  However the current treatment procedures suffer from severe drawbacks and are highly criticized by the consumers. Recent advancements in sensors and wireless communication offer an unprecedented opportunity for cost-effective home care options to treat sleep apnea. The project developed a prototype of SleepEaze technology that captures this opportunity. This technology is based on using a wireless biometric pillow to monitor the apnea patients? biorhythms during sleep, and it employs an algorithm to predict apnea events several minutes ahead of their onset. The use of the innovative prediction algorithm as well as low power electronic elements offer a breakthrough in the noninvasive monitoring that can lead to a new class of affordable wearable devices for sleep apnea care with high commercialization potential.

This project has pursued three major objectives. The first, technology Improvement thrust has led to the development of a noncontact optical sensor and its incorporation into a biometric pillow for continuous monitoring heart rate, respiration and blood oxygen levels. The sensor if based on the principle of photoplethysmography, which consists of using the a laser to detect blood volume changes under the skin surface. The project has also led to the development of a machine learning algorithm, called the balanced random survival forest, for predicting an impending apnea episode over 10 minutes ahead of its onset. The wearable sensor, including its form and the underlying electronic components were laid out to enhance comfort and ease of use. The second thrust involved extended testing of the prototype as well conducting multiple human subject studies to benchmark the performance of the device as well as that of the algorithms embedded into the device. The functional, refined prototype of the SleepEaze device (hardware and associated software interface) resulting from this project offers a radically new approach for monitoring sleep apnea. The third, ongoing thrust is in working the institution?s commercialization office to pursue a roadmap for commercializing this technology.

In addition, the has project has supported the training and professional development of two Ph.D. students (including one woman engineer), one post doctoral associate, and over 20 undergraduate students including four woman engineering students, seven members of underrepresented minority groups, and two members of Reserve Officers' Training Corps at Texas A&amp;M University. We are also collaborating closely with Center for Translational Research in Aging and Longevity to bring our expertise in engineering to the CTRAL staff.  The student efforts were also presented as part of the 2017 Global Grand Challenges Summit (GGCS) held in Washington DC. The efforts were recognized with the best poster award in at the Global Grand Challenges Summit. The undergraduate students engaged in this project were selected for the best poster award (3 times), undergraduate summer research grant (three students), won best innovation award as part of TEES AggiesInvent program (2 times), and to pursue graduate program (including PhD) in the current and peer institutions (5 students).  The PhD student (a woman engineer) won the best poster award at the Institute for Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) annual conference held in Orlando during May 2019 (first out of 80 selected for the poster competition), and was the finalist in health analytics section of the Institute of Operations Research and Management Science (INFORMS) best paper competition.

The technology would enable electric vehicles to travel longer ranges at affordable prices and solve the energy-storage problem when using intermittent renewable energies. The main findings from this project are summarized as shown below:

1: This project has identified an electrolyte composition enabling reversible potassium plating/stripping electrochemistry with high efficiency (&sim;99%) at ambient temperature for the first time. Furthermore, the superconcentrated electrolyte shows excellent electrochemical stability up to 5 V (vs K/K+) which enables good compatibility with high-voltage cathodes. Full cells with potassium Prussian blue cathodes are demonstrated. Our work contributes toward the understanding of potassium plating/stripping electrochemistry and paves the way for the development of potassium metal battery technologies.

2: K&minus;O2 batteries exhibit superior round-trip efficiency and considerable energy density in the absence of any electrocatalysts. For further improving the practical performance of K&minus;O2 batteries, it is important to carry out a systematic study on parameters that control rate performance and capacity to comprehensively understand the limiting factors in superoxide-based metal&minus;oxygen batteries. In this project, we investigate the influence of current density and oxygen diffusion on the nucleation, growth, and distribution of potassium superoxide (KO2) during the discharge process. We have also demonstrated a reduced graphene oxide-based K&minus;O2 battery with a large specific capacity (up to 8400 mAh/gcarbon at a discharge rate of 1000 mA/gcarbon) and a long cycle life (over 200 cycles).

3: We has also reported on a high capacity anode material for use in potassium&minus;oxygen and potassium-ion batteries. An antimony-based electrode exhibits a reversible storage capacity of 650 mAh/g (98% of theoretical capacity, 660 mAh/g) The Sb electrode can cycle for over 50 cycles at a capacity of 250 mAh/g, which is one of the highest reported capacities for a potassium-ion anode material. We have also explored the application of this anode material in the form of a K3Sb&minus;O2 cell which displays relatively high operating voltages, low overpotentials, increased safety, and interfacial stability, effectively demonstrating its applicability to the field of metal oxygen batteries.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: developing stable electrolytes and safe anodes alternative to potassium metal. 6 papers have been published from this project in high-impact journals. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including graduates and undergraduates, have received experiences in technology innovation, translation and entrepreneurship through the proposed research activities, prototype development and commercialization efforts. Three graduate students and one undergraduate student have graduated from this project.

Although hemodialysis is the primary lifeline for patients with end-stage kidney disease, vein failure necessitates expensive, rather ineffective interventional techniques and re-do operations. This puts the patient at an undue risk of infection, extensive hospitalizations, and death, with substantial, adverse ripple effects on the economy. This project will result in an optimized prototype of the VenoStent positioned for clinical translation. VenoStent has the unique capability to robustly encompass the complex, variable geometry of the graft-vein junction, where the majority of failures occur. It is also biocompatible, biodegradable, ductile, and tunable for optimal venous responses. In contrast to other competing technologies in development, these features enable sutureless, custom-fittable encompassing of the vein to reduce surgery times, risk of infection and wound reopening. These features should also impart reductions in hospitalizations, interventional techniques, re-do surgeries, and costs. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. First, the prototype must be optimized for its ability to encompass the venous anastomoses and promote a healthy vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype, as VSMCs play an integral role in the underlying neointimal formation responsible for vein failures. Sustained release of a therapeutic peptide, MK2i, from the external supports will also be evaluated in vitro for future commercialization adaptability incorporating a therapeutic. The precise geometry of the construct, pore size, and molar composition will be defined and then tested in an ex vivo model of the venous anastomosis. In addition, personnel involved in this project, namely a graduate student and post-doc, will receive extensive entrepreneurial and technology translational opportunities through participation in business courses, pitches, competitions, accelerator programs, and professional conferences.","Timothy C.

It can be summarized through the following

Major Activities:
 Several research and training activities highlight a significant amount of progress that occurred since September 1, 2016 towards achieving the aims of this proposal. The project results in 2 peer-reviewed publications, one PCT, and two international conference presentations.

Patents: PCT WO2016/168706 A1 ""DEVELOPMENT AND VASCULAR APLLICATIONS OF SHAPE MEMORY EXTERNAL STENTS"" was published 20 October 2016.

Publications: The manuscript ""External Support-based Approaches to Address Vein Graft and Hemodiaylsis Access Failures"" was published in Macromolecular Rapid Communications in 2016.  In addition ""Heparin-functionalized polymer graft surface eluting MK2 inhibitory peptide to improve hemocompatibility and antineointimal activity"" was published in Journal of Controlled Release 2017 (in print).

Presentations: Two oral presentations were conducted in the 2016 World Biomaterials Conference in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and NSF PFI Conference, Atlanta GA 2017.

Specific Aims:
 Aim 1: Evaluate SMP constructs for external stenting. Towards this aim, 1) Three contract manufacturers were collaborated, one for the manufacturing of the shape memory polymer material (MPD Chemicals), one for the fabrication of the SMP stents via dip casting and UV crosslinking (Murray Medical), and a third for the laser ablation of the final construct (Resonetics). 2) Three one-hour discussions were conducted with the FDA. Working with the Medical Device Regulatory Affairs Program (MDRAP) at Vanderbilt, our team first spoke with the FDA?s Division of Surgical Devices, Office of Device Evaluation, which led to a second discussion with the Associate Director at the Division of Cardiovascular Devices. Based on these conversations, they believe that this is a Class II device and suggest that we put together a 510(k) pre-submission application for this technology sooner rather than later. 3) Through these collaborations, a scalable manufacturing process has been realized, although additional work and testing was necessary to optimize it and see the entire process through. Cut on the underside, external stents are ""self-closing"", indicating that custom fitting around the anastomosis should not be a problem with these materials. 4) Characterization of VSMCs grown on these materials was conducted so far. Heparin-coated polymer constructs demonstrated an ability to sustain release of therapeutics over the course of at least 3 weeks in vitro. The first aim was completed 100%.

Aim 2: Study vein responses in external stents in an ex vivo PTFE-vein anastomosis model. Towards this aim,
 1) An ex vivo model mimicking the venous anastomoses in hemodialysis access grafts was established.
 2) In concurrence to applying treatments to this ex vivo model, the prototype design was optimized through other experimental and computational modeling-based means.
 3) Pore architectures that are optimal for tissue ingrowth and vascularization were evaluated in an in vivo subcutaneous mouse model, as it was well-established through the literature that vascularization and outgrowth of the adventitial layer inversely relates to neointimal formation.
 4) On the other hand, the ability of external supports to reduce wall stress was also shown to play a beneficial role in minimizing neointimal hyperplasia. In collaboration with Dr. Haoxiang Luo in Mechanical Engineering at Vanderbilt, computational modeling, computational modeling was conducted to optimize the design of external stent
 5) Ex vivo treatments was completed and conclusions were drawn from these experimental and computational avenues. Some flow-based experiments were also conducted to evaluate the effects of the external supports in conditions that were more hemodynamically-mimetic of the human physiology. This specific aim was completed 100 %.
 6) Discussions with the FDA are already underway, a follow up meeting is planned for the winter of 2017, and a pre-submission application has been sent recently.

This project is important because it addresses some of the fundamental limitations of current battery systems that ultimately impact energy-density (e.g. the driving range of hybrid or electric vehicles).  It also provides new insight into failure modes in order to mitigate or correct them early in the life-cycle of the system.  This could have a broader significance for a variety of automotive, military, and electrical utility applications while reducing barriers to low-carbon energy storage.  The project will result in a proof-of-concept prototype of a reliable, low-cost and efficient battery management system.  This active battery management system will have the following unique features: it will utilize an integrated circuit design of a resonant DC-DC converter to achieve high efficiency and high power-density, it will enable efficient, granular management of individual cells or groups of cells in a large battery array, and it will implement diagnostic capabilities based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in an embedded system controller.  These features provide advantages of lower cost, smaller size, higher efficiency, and greatly expanded visibility into real-time electrochemical phenomena when compared to the leading competing battery management architectures in this market space. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: the lack of high-density and suitably cost effective power electronics for use in active battery management systems, knowledge gaps in the control and regulation of large arrays of series-connected cells, and technology gaps that exist between diagnostic capabilities and power management in electrochemical systems.  The first gap will be bridged by designing a high-density resonant switched-capacitor DC-DC converter, implemented in a mm-scale integrated circuit (IC) that has variable regulation capability. The second gap will be bridged by designing embedded control algorithms for large arrays of series-connected cells, using multiple-input, multiple-output control algorithms explored in previous research.  The final gap is bridged by designing algorithms that can run on a system-level embedded controller to implement online electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on top of the power management platform.  

In addition, personnel involved in this project, the PI and a graduate student, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship mentoring through affiliation with the Innovation PhD program at Dartmouth, which includes both coursework and experiential business education and through discussions with industry connections in the electric transportation sector. The Co-PI on this project is the Director of the Innovation PhD program and will provide additional mentoring and support specific to this project.","Christopher Schaef

While there have been steady technical and manufacturing improvements in electrochemical materials and process technologies, there have been few transformational innovations in battery management &ndash; particularly at the intersection of distributed power electronics, control systems, and diagnostics. This research effort helped to expand and explore several technical and commercialization challenges that were identified in prior NSF-funded research (lineage). Specifically, the research addressed a new class of efficient, high-density (potentially low cost) power electronics, particularly well suited to distributed battery management, and associated control and diagnostics challenges.

In this PFI:AIR Technology Translation project, researchers at Dartmouth designed, implemented, and tested a mm-scale integrated circuit using a new resonant switched capacitor architecture that could process and re-allocate up to ~4W of power among adjacent cells in an electrochemical stack with over 94% efficiency. The IC solution is scalable in that it can be operated in a stacked architecture to provide state-of-charge (SOC) equalization for large-scale electrochemical systems, potentially replacing inefficient shunt resistor solutions at a comparable cost point. The Dartmouth team developed new methods to control and regulate power flow using a 4-quadrant current mode quasi-resonant scheme. On top of this hardware and control platform they embedded integrated diagnostics in the form of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The goal of this research was to demonstrate that all these techniques could be merged together and to highlight a roadmap towards realistic commercial viability.

The project funded 2 graduate students in two different research phases and resulted in several journal and peer-reviewed conference publications. It also resulted in the filing of two patents. A commercial venture, Hive Battery Inc., related to this research was spun out of Dartmouth and has received both Phase I and Phase II SBIR funding.

The rise of e-commerce is rapidly changing the landscape of retail business.  By 2017, online sales will account for more than 10% of this $4.5 trillion industry, according to a 2014 U.S. Census Bureau report.  To stay competitive in this growing market, retailers are under enormous pressure to quickly deliver the goods to their consumers at low prices.  Large asset-based carriers (e.g., UPS and FedEx) are not particularly cost-efficient for express local deliveries in urban areas, essentially because their distribution networks are designed to transport through hubs rather than directly between customers and retailers.  This inherent inefficiency is aggravated by mounting demand for same-day delivery--widely considered the Holy Grail for e-commerce at present--that requires more frequent dispatch and in turn increases transportation cost.  Recent arrival of tech giants such as Amazon, Google and Uber in this battlefield attests to the tremendous opportunities and challenges in the urban delivery industry. Ironically, there exists a large volume of unused capacity in the transport system.  For one thing, because the urban delivery industry is highly fragmented, consolidating its capacity is often difficult. Another underutilized capacity exists in millions of private passenger vehicles on the road with empty trunks that could be used for delivery.  Addressing this lack of adequate coordination between demand and supply holds the key to solving the express urban delivery challenge.  A promising solution, enabled by recent advances in wireless communication and mobile computing, is crowd-sourcing technology that has been successfully applied in passenger transport (e.g., Uber and Lyft).  The overarching goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a CROwd-sourced Urban Delivery (CROUD) system.  With CROUD, consumers will enjoy faster, cheaper and more reliable delivery service. The retail industry will see a stronger consumer demand.  The delivery industry will improve its profitability and reduce its environmental impact, while employing a highly mobile and efficient workforce.  The project will also educate next generation entrepreneurs by providing training opportunities and materials for upgrading curricula in multiple disciplines.   

The scientific contributions of the project span across several disciplines, and they are closely interconnected in supporting a human-centered smart CROUD system.  First, the project will lead to pricing mechanisms that focus on matching consumers with couriers under varying market conditions.  The use of matching models is novel in pricing analysis for two-sided markets, such as thouse found in CROUD systems, and it promises insights in other markets.  Second, the project will help understand and predict behaviors and choices of humans in a CROUD system, a field completely new to behavioral econometrists.  New econometric models, calibrated with behavioral data collected in this project, will be built into management strategies to enhance the consumer-courier-technology interaction in the system.   Third, the proposed research will develop smartphone-based motion detection methods that are uniquely suited to track and interpret the activities of couriers.  Finally, the project will create computational tools to facilitate collaborative delivery among couriers and to optimize routing plans based on real-time information. In doing so, new formulations, algorithms and insights will be generated for challenging problems in operations research and computational economics such as network design with relays, real-time vehicle routing considering transfer and environmental impacts.

Wright Street,Urbana,IL,61801-3620,Urbana,US,13	0,"This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project will develop a mobile sensor technology for performing detection and identification of viral and bacterial pathogens. By means of a smartphone-based detection instrument, the results are shared with a cloud-based data management service that will enable physicians to rapidly visualize the geographical and temporal spread of infectious disease. When deployed by a community of medical users (such as veterinarians or point-of-care clinicians), the PathTracker system will enable rapid determination and reporting of instances of infectious disease that can inform treatment and quarantine responses that are currently not possible with tests performed at central laboratory facilities.  

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) currently represent the most sensitive and specific approaches for identification of viral or bacterial pathogens, with intense research focus directed towards miniaturization, acceleration, and automation of the protocol for amplifying disease-specific DNA sequences to easily-measured concentration. The plan is to apply the results of previously NSF-funded advances in photonic crystal enhanced fluorescence (PCEF) and smartphone fluorescence spectroscopy to implement PCR or LAMP assays within sub-?l liquid volumes for reduction in the assay amplification time to register a measurable fluorescent signal. Importantly, the detection approach enables >10x multiplexing of PCR (or LAMP) reactions within a chip that can be ""swiped"" through a custom handheld detection instrument that interfaces with the back-facing camera of a conventional smartphone in a manner that is similar to reading a credit card. A mobile device software application will guide the user through the assay process, interpret the results of the detection (including correlation of assay measurements with on-chip experimental controls), and communicate results to a cloud-based data management system along with other relevant information provided by the user. Importantly, the app will enable the user to view the results of tests performed by other users, with a mobile device interface that enables simple visualization of the locations, times, and circumstances surrounding positive/negative tests. The system will enable users to request customizable alerts when positive tests occur within the network of users, and to highlight confirmed positive cases when conventional laboratory tests can confirm results of positive field tests. The app will track outcomes and report statistics on system performance, including Receiver Operating Characteristic of assays. 

While the system will initially be deployed in the context of equine infectious disease representing an opportunity to mitigate enormous economic losses associated with infectious disease in the horse industry, the developed technology will be equally applicable to humans, food animals, and companion animals. Considering the economic and health impact of ebola, HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, when PathTracker is fully deployed within developing nations, the potential of the system to save lives by rapid delivery effective treatment, quarantine of infectious patients, and rapid identification/reporting of new cases is enormous.

We used the camera in an ordinary smartphone as the sensor for a highly sensitive and highly specific nucleic acid test for both viral and bacterial pathogens, with performance that matches the capabilities of laboratory-based gold standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Adapting a simpler and more robust molecular biology approach called Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), we demonstrated the ability to evaluate the presence of up to 8 pathogens in a single test sample, with sample-to-answer in 30-40 minutes.  Our approach utilized an inexpensive ""cradle"" that mates with the user?s smartphone which heats the test sample to the required temperature and illuminates it with LEDs, while the phone?s rear-facing camera records the generation of green fluorescent light that indicates a positive test.  Although our initial detection targets were viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens for horses, the approach is broadly applicable to detection for human diseases (HIV, COVID, Zika, Dengue), environmental monitoring, and food safety. Integration with a smartphone facilitates interfacing detection results with cloud-based service systems that support epidemiology, reporting to public health authorities, and telemedicine services.  Follow-on efforts include development of a microfluidic cartridge that integrates all the required reagents, to facilitate performing the test in point-of-care settings such as health clinics.  In the context of combating the COVID-19 crisis, the demonstrated capability enables inexpensive, rapid, high sensitivity testing in workplaces, travel, education, and military environments.

Nanoparticles are being used in more and more commercial and industrial products while their health and environmental implications are still under debate. The toxicity of nanomaterials not only varies among different materials, but is also highly dependent on the dose of exposure. Developing a sensitive method to detect the release and spatio-temporal distribution of nanoparticles in the environment as well as in daily lives is a high priority before their toxicity effects are fully understood via long-term toxicological studies. Despite this urgent need for widespread detection and quantification of nanoparticle distributions, current technologies are lacking appropriate features for ubiquitous and cost-effective mapping and quantification of nanoparticle contamination. This project aims to create a transformative and human-centered toolset for on-site and ubiquitous quantification and automated characterization of nanomaterials found in houses, workplaces and the environment based on the cost-effective integration of computational imaging and mobile sensing techniques with big data based dynamic machine learning algorithms. 

The central challenge in this project is to translate the bulky and expensive laboratory equipment currently used for nanoparticle quantification and characterization to field-portable, easy-to-use, cost-effective, and rapid analysis devices and smart service systems aiming to be massively used by consumers in their daily routines. To solve this challenge, highly sensitive optical imaging systems will be developed based on mass-produced Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor chips embedded in mobile phones with extraordinary signal to noise ratios (SNR) and large fields-of-view for high-throughput machine learning based automated nanoparticle analysis and classification. One approach this will take is to combine computational microscopy with self-assembled nanolenses around nanoparticles that significantly enhance imaging SNR and contrast. The aim of this approach is to enable automated detection and sizing of individual nanoparticles, mono-dispersed samples, and complex poly-dispersed mixtures, where the sample concentrations can span ~5 orders-of-magnitude and particle sizes can range from 40 nm to millimeter-scale, which provide unmatched performance metrics compared to existing nanoparticle sizing approaches. Another approach that will be implemented is the development of highly sensitive multi-modal (e.g. fluorescence plus dark-field) mobile phone based microscopy platforms for distributed nanoparticle imaging and sensing. Furthermore, in terms of big data analysis and machine learning tools, the techniques in this project can adaptively learn ""semantic"" similarities that can be used for more accurate data classification. These techniques are unlike existing techniques developed so far in the literature.  The extant technologies are based only on signal similarities, which do not work well on multi-modality data. The smart and adaptive methods of this project are the first in the literature that come with confidence bounds, that is, they not only have the capability to accurately classify the information, but they also provide guarantees about the accuracy of this classification, which is quite important for self-learning smart service systems. Through these field-portable devices that are integrated with adaptive big data based decision analytics and quantification algorithms, spatio-temporal maps of nanoparticle concentrations and size distributions in various consumer samples will be created for public or personal monitoring (e.g., measurements of waterborne/airborne particles at home, workplace, or airborne particles along a freeway, etc.).

The broader impacts of this transformative research include (1) The development of these nanoparticle sensing and quantification platforms and smart service systems will extend the boundaries of current optical metrology science, resulting in new advances in the fields of nanophotonics and optical microscopy (2) These devices will also be easy to translate into various biomedical, chemical and material science applications, significantly impacting the use and regulations of nanotechnologies in consumer market and related products. (3) This project would deliver a paradigm-shift by ubiquitous quantification and spatiotemporal mapping/monitoring of nanoparticle contamination and exposure even in non-laboratory settings, assisting in the revelation and better understanding of various cause-effect relationships at the consumer level that have remained unidentified so far due to the limitations of existing nano-imaging, detection and quantification technologies, also providing maps of potential health risks. (4) This project will also establish a complementary educational outreach program based in California.

The toxicity of nanomaterials not only varies   among  different materials, but is also highly dependent on the dose of    exposure. Developing a sensitive method to detect the release and    spatio-temporal distribution of nanoparticles in the environment as well    as in daily lives is a high priority before their toxicity effects  are   fully understood via long-term toxicological studies. Despite this    urgent need for widespread detection and quantification of  nanoparticle   distributions, current technologies are lacking  appropriate features  for  ubiquitous and cost-effective mapping and  quantification of   nanoparticle contamination. This project focused to  create a  transformative  and human-centered toolset for on-site and  ubiquitous  quantification  and automated characterization of  nanomaterials found in  houses,  workplaces and the environment based on  the cost-effective  integration  of computational imaging and mobile  sensing techniques with  big data  based dynamic machine learning  algorithms.

This proposal?s central challenge has been to translate the bulky and    expensive laboratory equipment currently used for nanoparticle    quantification to field-portable, easy-to-use, cost-effective, and rapid    analysis devices and smart service systems aiming to be massively  used   by consumers in their daily routines as well as researchers in  various   fields. To solve this challenge, highly sensitive  computational  optical  imaging systems have been developed based on  mass-produced  image sensor  chips embedded in our mobile phones for  high-throughput  machine learning  based automated particle analysis and  classification.

Broader impacts of this transformative research included: (1) The    development of nanoparticle sensing and big data based characterization    platforms and smart service systems extends the boundaries of  current   optical metrology science, resulting in new advances in the  fields of   nano and biophotonics and optical nanoscopy. (2) The developed methods   and devices are easy to translate into various biomedical, chemical   and  material science applications, significantly impacting the use and    regulations of nanotechnologies in consumer market and related  products.  (3) The techniques created through this NSF-funded research  project  enable ubiquitous quantification and  spatio-temporal  mapping/monitoring  of nanoparticle contamination and  exposure even in  non-laboratory  settings (e.g., at the home), which might help us reveal  and better  understand various cause-effect relationships that have  remained  unidentified so far due to the  limitations of existing   nanotechnologies. (4) The machine learning and stream  mining approaches   that were developed in this proposal also create bridges to many other   disciplines including big  data analysis, network science, and   optimization theory.

This project has also created training and educational opportunities   for undergraduate and graduate  students. These students co-authored   several journal and conference publications and also presented their   work at various  research conferences, publicly disseminating the new   results emanating from this project. High school students have also   joined the research team over the summer quarters.

In particular, the project seeks to overcome use problems with mobile-wearable electronics systems that have undermined long-term patient acceptance.  Based on the ""epidermal"" electronic platform developed by the principal investigators, the system will offer ""skin-like"" properties, to enable intimate, complete, non-invasive integration with people in ways that are impossible with any technology that exists today.  This mobile-wearable health-monitoring system will be mechanically ""invisible"" (i.e., not constraining natural motions or processes of the skin), and will be compatible with daily life activities to ensure long-term sustained engagement of users.  It will interact with people through self-detection, self-diagnosis and self-monitoring and will allow clinicians to monitor their patients through wireless communications and data transmission to facilitate self-correcting and self-controlled functions. It will allow the general public to continuously assess personal health and well-being.  Continuous monitoring of medical devices may help to prevent serious medical problems through early intervention, particularly in high risk groups of people, thereby providing critical capabilities to the healthcare service system.

In pursuing the basic goal of spurring the development and maturation of flexible skin-applied sensors with wireless connection to monitoring and diagnostic systems, the project combines the research expertise of the principal investigators in the core intellectual content of the proposed platforms, which includes nanomaterials, sensors, advanced signal processing, system design, industrial design/human factors and clinical studies.  This integration will lead to smart systems that have the potential to transform healthcare.  The research entails the following:
       *	Development of ""skin-like"" temperature, hydration, and electrophysiology sensors, with wireless operation.  These systems will exploit unique hardware, formed using extensions of ideas from the principal investigators' recent work on epidermal electronics and sensors.
       * Studies of interactions between this technology and people, particularly in order to account for human factors relevant to the technology development to ensure lifestyle compatibility.
       *	Development of effective and robust computational modeling and algorithms for statistical signal processing of the sensor data and pattern recognition to create a user-friendly interface for clinicians, patients and even the general public to enable the interpretation of these data and their implications for health and well-being.
       *	Application of the proposed health monitoring system to skin.  The continuous capture, storage and transmission of sensor data will be critical to the design of these smart, ""always-on"" health-monitoring systems.

The mechanical ""invisibility"" of the wearable devices means that they do not interfere with people's daily lives.  Accounting for lifestyle compatibility can be illustrated as follows: the less behavior change a device requires in order to simply wear it, the more likely it is that it will drive long-term sustained engagement for users and thus overcome the major limitation of most wearable devices.

The system, based on the ?epidermal? electronic platform developed by the PIs, offers ?skin-like? properties, to enable intimate, complete non-invasive integration with people in ways that are impossible with any technology that exists today.  It does not constrain natural motions or processes of the skin, and is compatible with daily life activities to ensure long-term sustained engagement for users.  It interacts with people through self-detection, self-diagnosis and self-monitoring, and allows clinicians to monitor their patients through wireless communications and data transmission to facilitate self-correcting and self-controlled functions, and the general public to assess, continuously, their health and wellbeing.  Continuous monitoring of medical devices may help to prevent serious medical problems, through early intervention particularly in high risk groups of people, thereby providing critical capabilities to our healthcare service system.

The project has also focused on recruiting and involving URM (under-represented minority) students.  An example is a Hispanic American undergraduate student, who joined this project as a summer intern, and then became a Ph.D. student of the PI, and has won the prestigious NSF Graduate Fellowship, Ford Foundation Fellowship, and American Society of Mechanical Engineers Graduate Fellowship.

Orthoses are externally applied assistive devices that meet the personal needs of people with disabilities.  They are designed to achieve one or more of the following goals: control of biomechanical alignment, correction or accommodation of deformity, and/or protection and support of an injury.  Custom-made orthoses provide a better fit for users. They are more comfortable and facilitate more effective treatment.  However, the traditional plaster molding fabrication method for custom orthoses requires a long delivery time and multiple visits to the clinic, which are often physically, mentally, and/or financially difficult for users of orthoses and their caregivers. The service system is targeted for the One-Day Visit by facilitating the measurement, design, fabrication, and evaluation of foot orthoses and ankle-foot orthoses all within the same day of the patient's visit to the clinic.  The current custom orthoses design also lacks both the adaptability to adjust the stiffness for individual needs and the sensors to measure and record the motion data for clinicians and users.  This project plans on creating a cyber-physical service system aimed to fulfill these needs.  

The projected service system utilizes cloud-based design and 3D-printing, a rapid manufacturing technique for custom orthoses, to enable the One-Day Visit.  For this system, the clinician scans the foot and leg of the patient and uploads the geometrical and clinical prescription data to a cloud-based Cyber Design Center, which has the biomechanical models, baseline inertia measurement unit (IMU) sensor data, and a user-in-the-loop framework developed in this project to design the user-adaptive, sensor-embedded custom orthoses.  Advanced lightweight, energy-efficient motion sensors measure and record the orthosis motion in the living environment for a week.  While recharging the battery of the IMU data logger, the subject's motion data are uploaded to a cloud database and analyzed for evaluation of the gait and orthosis functions for the user.  This research connects three key aspects of the fused deposition modeling (FDM) for fabrication of custom orthoses: the measurement of defects using nano-computed tomography, prediction of plastic material properties based on the defect geometry, and FDM process optimization.  The ruled-based biomechanical decision-support model that can automatically design the shape of custom foot and ankle-foot orthoses based on user information and clinician prescription is studied for orthosis design practice. The development of a user-based optimization framework with long-term motion data of a user as the input will advance the scientific knowledge of user-in-the-loop design and control of assistive devices. This cyber-physical service system for custom orthoses presents a vision wherein the cloud-based design and 3D-printing technologies can harmonize with healthcare by providing a better service for assistive device users and their caregivers.  The efficacy of treatment and the quality-of-life of people with disabilities can be improved by having comfortable and adaptable orthoses delivered in a timely fashion.

The lead institution, University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan), is partnering with Stratasys (Eden Prairie, Minnesota) and Altair (Troy, Michigan) in this project.  The University of Michigan offers extensive research innovations in optimizing internal structures for 3D-printed porous structure, novel passive dynamic orthosis design, using motion sensors for gait analysis, and user-in-the-loop design and control.  Stratasys, a pioneer and leader in FDM machines and materials, will partner to provide the state-of-the-art FDM technology.  Altair has cloud-based product design center expertise, which includes all the associated software, hardware, and security infrastructure.  Broader Context partners include Becker Orthopedic (Troy, Michigan); University of Michigan Orthotics and Prosthetics Center (Ann Arbor, Michigan); and VA Ann Arbor Health System (Ann Arbor, Michigan).","Chisena RS, Engstrom SM, Shih AJ~Computed tomography evaluation of the porosity and fiber orientation in short carbon fiber material extrusion filaments and parts~Additive Manufacturing~34~2020~~~~0~ ~0~ ~30/08/2020 23:26:17.633000000, D.

There are nearly three million registered nurses employed in the United States, making them the largest pool of healthcare providers in the country. Technology that affects the performance of this large labor pool cannot fail to have impact. Due to advancements in robotics and computer technology, access to intelligent communication, sensing, and computing hardware is on the cusp of becoming common--not only for healthcare professionals, but also for patients themselves. The project led by The University of Texas at Arlington will focus on the creation of new design tools that can configure the hardware and software of adaptive robotic nursing assistants (ARNA). ARNA will be specifically designed to assist nurses in healthcare facilities with simple tasks such as, lift assistance, delivery of everyday lightweight objects (medicine, medical wearable equipment), and some physical assistance with movement of heavier objects, such as furniture, gurneys, and the patients themselves. The design and engineering innovations resulting from insights gained in this project may have great value deployed as products in broader consumer markets in addition to hospitals. Examples include in-home service and assistive robots, robots for assistance in public venues, and co-Robot manufacturing where humans are in close proximity to robot workers. The improved understanding of human-robot and nurse-robot interaction could represent enabling technology that will facilitate research breakthroughs and increase productivity and social acceptance of robotics. The research will also advance the understanding of the perceptual effects of robot design aesthetics and interfaces.

The proposed Adaptive Robotic Nurse Assistants will navigate cluttered hospitals, while equipped with multi-modal skin sensors that can anticipate nurse intent, automate mundane low-level tasks, but keep nurses in the decision loop. Modular and strong hardware will be deployed in reconfigurable platforms specially designed for nurse physical assistance. Adaptive human-machine interfaces will play a key role in this project, as these interfaces directly impact the ability of robots to help nurses in a dynamic, unstructured environment. Rather than pre-programming robot behaviors,  learning algorithms will be used so that robots adapt to human preferences. Two leading applications are envisioned for feasibility evaluation by quantitative and qualitative metrics, including patient sitters and walkers. The sitter robot will take vital sign measurements, evaluate risk from patient movement and pose, and provide continuous observation of patients and feedback to and from nurses. The walker robot will assist nurses and patients by providing partial balance support, navigating cluttered environments, and assisting with medical equipment transportation.

The lead institution is the University of Texas at Arlington with its multidisciplinary departments including the College of Engineering, College of Nursing, and the University of Texas at Arlington Research Institute (UTARI). Primary industrial partners include QinetiQ-North America (Waltham, MA), a large corporation specializing in unmanned systems, and RE2 (Pittsburgh, PA),  a small business specializing in modular robotic manipulators that will contribute unique battle-tested hardware and systems engineering.

Low-cost nanowire sensor technology is important because it has the potential to improve multiple types of detection systems, with impacts in disease detection, food safety, antiterrorism capabilities, higher crop yields (due to earlier detection of pathogens), and better protection for emergency responders and industrial plant workers (due to better chemical detection). The project will result in a proof-of-concept electrochemical nanosensor for gas/vapor sensing with the following unique features: 1) it will be based on a combined top-down and bottom-up nanomanufacturing method that directly deposits nanowires on micro-fabricated devices, 2) it will be fabricated via a room temperature process, 3) it will utilize a reversible synthesis process that may enable in-field regeneration and reuse, 4) it will have new or broadened sensor capabilities through a modular approach enabling combinatory synthesis of a wide range of novel organic nanowires, and 5) it will be compatible with flexible electronic architectures.  These features will provide the following advantages: low-cost, scalable, reusable, modular, and applicable to a diverse range of chemicals as compared to other competing sensor technologies in this market space.

Nanowires have been applied to sensing for over 10 years but few nanowire sensors have reached the market. The major barriers are the complexity of manufacturing and difficulty in connecting nanowires in microelectronic devices. In current competing technologies, nanowires need to be aligned and placed at precise locations and orientations on the patterned substrates, a complex process to scale up. This new technology synthesizes nanowires directly on the metal substrates by using the metal micro- and nanopattern as nucleation points to grow the nanowires. It is based on seed-mediated nucleation research. When a nanoparticle is used as a seed, the high curvature of the seed imposes unsustainable strain energy on the nucleated crystal at the crystal/seed interface and results in a nanowire crystal. In addition, a graduate student involved in this project will gain technology translation experience through exposure to business methodologies, access to technology transfer networks, and a deeper engagement in the university technology transfer process.

Nanowires have been applied to sensing for over 10 years but few nanowire sensors have reached the market. The major barriers are the complexity of manufacturing and difficulty in connecting nanowires in microelectronic devices. This PFI AIR:TT funding has enabled the PI Dr. Guangzhao Mao at Wayne State University to work with co-PI Nicholas Cucinelli, a serial entrepreneur and mentor, to move the NSF-funded research along the path toward commercialization. We have constructed several sensor prototypes for gas/vapor sensing include a glass chip, a watch, and a networkable circuit.

Intellectual Merit:

Our approach is a solution based, room temperature process, which facilitates scalable manufacturing directly on existing microelectronic circuitry. The Mao lab made the original discovery that when mixing organic crystalline compounds with nanoparticles in a solution, nanowires nucleated on nanoparticles upon solvent evaporation. Subsequently we have developed and tested a working hypothesis that links the nanowire formation to the nanoconfinement effect imposed by the nanoparticle seed. The nanoconfinement concept has been successfully applied to the synthesis of nanowires of tetrathiafulvalene charge-transfer salts on gold nanoparticle seeds using electrocrystallization. In current competing technologies, nanowires need to be aligned and placed at precise locations and orientations on the patterned substrates, a complex process to scale up. Our method synthesizes organic nanowires directly on the metal substrates by using the metal micro- and nanopattern as nucleation points to grow the nanowires. We have achieved the following specific outcomes: 1) confirmation of the seed-mediated nanowires as conductive nanomaterials, 2) reproducible construction of nanowire connections on microelectrode patterns based on our method, and 3) demonstration of functional nanowires for electrochemical sensing of gases and vapors.

Broader Impacts:

The proof-of-concept project has demonstrated the capability and reliability of our nanowire materials as signal transducers in a prototype sensor device built on commercial electronic components. Our extensive market research has led to our focus on dual use technology: ammonia detection for worker safety and energetics detection for military use. The PI and her students have benefited from exposure to business and commercialization methodologies, access to Michigan?s Tech Transfer Talent Network resources, and deeper engagement in the university tech transfer process. The PI has worked closely with a number of underrepresented minority students in her laboratory who benefited from exposure to this research. The INTERN supplement has exposed the graduate student to new knowledge and skills that are not normally part of the academic training in a chemical engineering department.

 Project Outcomes Report

 Over 280 million people in the U.S. rely on approximately 156,000 public drinking water systems for consumptive and non-consumptive uses.  Many Americans are worried about the quality of drinking water at their homes, with good reason.  First, water can get contaminated with toxic heavy metals along the distribution line, despite water utilities? rigorous and regular monitoring of water quality at the water supply intake and the treatment plant.  Second, many pipes in U.S. water supply systems are near or even past their operational life, and replacing the aging water infrastructure would take years and cost trillions of dollars. If these pipes are not replaced in time, the public health may be jeopardized due to water contamination associated with aging distribution infrastructure. Third, water catastrophes have occurred, with some of them on a large scale.  For instance, the Flint Water Crisis, partly caused by the corrosion of aging, lead-containing water pipes, has resulted in severe health issues for ~8,000 children.  To safeguard water quality and public health, it is crucial to monitor toxic heavy metals and other water contaminants throughout the water supply system and particularly at the point of use.  Current quantitative detection methods for aqueous heavy metal ions are often laboratory-based and accurate down to parts per billion (ppb) levels.  However, these methods are costly and require days for sample analysis to be completed, making them unsuitable for regular on-site detection.  Qualitative detection methods are suitable for the field, relatively inexpensive, and quick, but they are unreliable and provide inadequate sensitivity. 

 

We have developed a sensitive, selective, and cost-effective micro-sized sensor chip for quantitative, real-time, in situ detection of heavy metal ions in drinking water.  The sensor chip is built upon a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-gold nanoparticle (NP) sensing platform that can be used for detecting a wide range of analytes such as heavy metal ions, bacteria, and nutrients in water.  The sensor chip works as a field-effect transistor (FET) with rGO as the sensing channel.  The combination of unique electronic properties of rGO and its low cost makes this technology a truly transformative one for the water industry.  Target analytes can be detected by measuring the sensor resistance change, since rGO?s conductivity varies with the binding of analytes to the probes pre-anchored on the gold NPs.  Top highlights of our sensor are: (1) Fast &ndash; Rapid response for real-time monitoring (detection time in seconds); (2) Miniaturized &ndash; The micron-sized sensor can be integrated into existing water equipment; (3) Highly sensitive &ndash; Lower detection limit on the order of &micro;g/L or below; (4) Scalable &ndash; Fabrication can be scaled up with good reproducibility/high electrical stability; (5) Inline continuous detection &ndash; Sensors can be placed directly in the flowing water system; (6) Wireless communication compatible &ndash; Ready for integration with wireless communication.  This breakthrough technology allows for real-time detection of contaminants with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity in field settings for single point testing with a handheld device as well as for continuous monitoring through deployment in existing water equipment. 

 

A prototype of the handheld device, consisting of the sensor chip housed in a test cell and attached to a digital meter, showed promising performance for rapid and selective detection of lead ions in drinking water.  The breakthrough technology and prototype were recently featured by the NSF Science Nation Video (https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/science_nation/leadiondetector.jsp).  The device was able to measure lead well below the level required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the laboratory and in point-of-use field settings. Maximum contaminant levels allowed by the EPA are 15 ppb for lead, 2 ppb for mercury, and 10 ppb for arsenic. In addition, the sensor detects lead ions within seconds &mdash; a feature promising for real-time monitoring of water quality.  Moreover, we have recently applied these sensor chips in flowing water, suggesting the capability of alerting high lead concentrations in the flowing water.  Overall, our novel, in-line micro-sized electronic sensor outperforms the existing water testing methods and is simple to implement, eliminating many disadvantages associated with current practices.  And we are ready to translate such a scientific discovery into the commercial reality through further R&amp;D efforts.

This system would provide this information allowing users to accurately track their nutritional status directly rather than relying on guesses based on diet. The ""NutriPhone"" system is comprised of a hardware accessory that attaches to a smartphone, custom test strips that accept a blood sample and conduct a detection assay, and a software app. The app operates the smartphone, interprets the test strip results, displays the results to the user in an intuitive fashion, and provides therapeutic suggestions, if needed. The personalized self-report and automated data streams are expected to yield greater awareness and self-management of health and diet.

Vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies are responsible for a multitude of adverse health conditions, including anemia, rickets, scurvy, adverse pregnancy outcomes, infant growth inhibition, osteoporosis, and cancer. Worldwide, over 1,000,000 people die every year from vitamin A and zinc deficiencies alone.  Domestically, as many as half of patients with hip fractures are thought to be vitamin D deficient.  Fortunately, many deficiencies and their symptoms are reversible through changes in diet or by taking supplements, particularly if detected early. Very few people, however, have information as to their own personal micronutrient status, what the potential outcomes of their deficiencies are, or the recommended treatments. Having nutritional status information could significantly enable healthier living. In addition to commercial outreach, NutriPhone technology will be integrated into Cornell's Division of Nutritional Sciences' community extension programs both domestically and internationally, including the NutritionWorks program (nutritionworks.cornell.edu), to improve and strengthen capacity, particularly around nutrition and health.

A unique nanoparticle-based binding reaction allows the creation of an optical contrast depending on the level of the particular marker (e.g., vitamin D).  The technology allows the measurement of this optical contrast using the smartphone camera, which is integral to every smartphone. Among the important aspects of this use of the smartphone camera is that it dramatically reduces the cost of the accessory. The state of the art currently is to use liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry (LCMS) to measure vitamin D.  A nanoparticle-based optical contrast assay is a major advancement. The research program is structured to address the scientific and engineering challenges with the development of the NutriPhone in parallel with the equally important consumer uptake and business model development challenges.  This is done through a series of user trials that will be conducted throughout the program at Cornell and extensive product development support, market research, consumer focus groups, and business model development support provided by the industrial partner, Amway.   The most transformative aspect of this type of technology is that it will enable quantitative diagnostics to be deployed directly to the consumer rather than through an intermediary.

Fortunately, many deficiencies and their symptoms are reversible through changes in diet or by taking supplements, particularly if detected early. Very few people, however, have information as to their own personal micronutrient status, what the potential outcomes of their deficiencies are, or the recommended treatments. 

In this project we have developed a rapid nanoparticle-based binding reaction that allows the creation of an optical contrast that is dependent on the level of the particular nutritional marker (e.g. vitamin D or vitamin B12) and can be read by a smartphone camera.  We have also performed a series of studies that help us understand the best way to deliver to deliver this information to users in such a way that they can interpret the results and understand the consequences.  

The scientific outcomes from this work have been reported in numerous articles in scientific journal and given scientific talks at prestigious multi-disciplinary conferences.  In addition, a start-up company was formed, VitaScan, which has licensed the IP resulting from this project and is currently pursuing commercialization of the technology.

Recent advancements in specialized materials and fabrication technologies offer exciting opportunities to create seamless garments as sensors and actuators for biomedical applications. Knitting fabrication, known as the intermeshing of yarns into loops (resulting in fabrics), is an ancient form of textile production widely used in the fashion industry. Knitting technology has gained a great deal of attention in the field of wearable electronics and could become a widespread method of construction for smart textiles in the future. In this PFI:BIC project from Drexel University, the aim is to replace current bulky medical monitoring devices with a line of lightweight smart garments. The fiber content of these garments will be similar to those commonly used in active wear such as wicking polyester to insure breathability and comfort, while the actuators and sensors, made of smart materials, will be strategically placed in the clothing to comprise only a small percentage of the material used. The project will leverage intellectual property pertaining to fabric-based connectors, microwave antennas, super capacitors, and robotics, to integrate smart fabric sensors and actuators into comfortable clothing, providing unobtrusive sensing and treatment options that are not currently possible.
 
For textile communication, active and passive transceivers will be fabricated through knitting of different microwave structures. These knit microwave structures will also be used along with processing of passive RFID signals to create mechanical strain sensors. Mechanical actuation will be realized through knit robot technology making use of shape memory alloys. The knit antennas will be combined with knit supercapacitors to create wireless power systems for body area sensor networks. Focus groups with patients and healthcare practitioners will determine market needs. Prototype garments will be beta tested with sample target users. Industrial partners will provide raw materials, manufacturing advice, and commercialization expertise. Key is Shima Seiki knitting technology at Drexel University, which enables customization and innovation in the design and fabrication of wearable and machine washable smart (with integrated power and circuitry) textiles capable of wireless sensing and actuated treatment applications. Target applications that are the focus of this project will include a ""bellyband"" for uterine contraction monitoring during pregnancy, medical sensor patches, and knit robots for therapeutic massage.
 
Drexel University has formed an interdisciplinary academic team including expertise from industrial and fashion design, materials and electrical engineering, nursing and medicine, as well as management and entrepreneurship. To complement this academic team, a three-tier industry partnership representing all levels of production and commercialization has been formed. The Material Suppliers tier includes EY Technologies (small business, Fall River, MA), custom-engineering groups providing creative solutions for the development of specialized yarns allowing for the creation of raw materials with unique functionality for novel biomedical smart textiles. The Fabrication tier includes Shima Seiki USA (large business, Monroe Township, NJ), a leader in 3D knitting simulation software and computerized knitting machines to manufacture biomedical smart textiles at both laboratory and production scale. Finally, in the Commercialization tier, NetScientific America (small business, Harrison, NY) augmented by the industrial advisory board of the Drexel Coulter Translational Research program will help determine commercial viability of various biomedical smart textile solutions and carry promising technologies to the market. Ben Franklin Technology Partners/Southeastern PA (non-profit, Philadelphia, PA) will serve as a broader context partner building upon experience in launching university/industry partnerships that accelerate scientific discoveries to commercialization and seeding regional initiatives that strengthen the regional entrepreneurial community.","Patron, D., Mongan, B., Kurzweg, T.P., Fontecchio, A.K., Dion, G., Anday, E., Dandekar, K.R.~On the use of knitted antennas and inductively coupled RFID tags for wearable applications~IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems~~2015~~~~0~ ~0~ ~28/07/2016 19:37:08.823000000, Acharya, Sayandeep and Mongan, William M. and Rasheed, Ilhaan and Liu, Yuqiao and Anday, Endla and Dion, Genevieve and Fontecchio, Adam and Kurzweg, Timothy and Dandekar, Kapil R.~Ensemble Learning Approach via Kalman Filtering for a Passive Wearable Respiratory Monitor~IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics~23~2019~~~10.1109/JBHI.2018.2857924~10118764~1022 to 1031~10118764~OSTI~26/09/2019 01:02:04.160000000, S.

The intellectual merit of this project has been in the engineering, information technology, and human factors analysis of biomedical smart textiles.  We have developed fabric based RFID biosensors for respiration and uterine contraction monitoring.  We have developed models of the knit based structure and linked these models to computational electromagnetic design of RFID biosensors.  We have studied how the presence of the human body can impact the design and performance of these wearable biosensors.  Through use of a wireless channel emulation system, we have developed a testbed to experimentally characterize RFID chips for on-body applications.  We have developed machine learning and data fusion algorithms to process the signals from these knitted RFID to provide links to the underlying biological phenomena and used a medical mannequin simulator and human testing to validate our approach.  


In the area of broader impacts, the project has particularly engaged a large number of female students across a wide array of disciplines (i.e., engineering, computing, materials, and medicine).   Interdisciplinary research has occurred on the project with medical students embedded on teams with engineering and informatics students, customer focus groups have been conducted by integrated teams of sociologists and business students, and marketing plans have been written for the developed technology by executive MBA students.  In addition, an NSF Science Nation documentary was also produced to publicize the project results.  Building upon project activities, Drexel University recently formed a new Center for Functional Fabrics and is a founding partner in Advanced Functional Fabrics of America (AFFOA), a new national manufacturing innovation institute funded in part by the Department of Defense. AFFOA is specifically oriented towards matching academic and industrial partners to translate high technology readiness level (TRL) fabric technologies to commercial applications. Project related patents and invention disclosures have been submitted that are available for licensing and commercialization through our connection to AFFOA.

According to Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) annual  ""Consumer Sentinel Network Data Book"", the most comprehensive database of U.S. fraud trends, American consumers submitted more than 1.5 million complaints - a 62 percent increase in just three years, and they reported losing over $1.6 billion to fraud in 2013. Detecting increasingly complex fraud schemes requires services that are able to integrate and enrich data from disparate financial and other data sources and hunt for recurring and often interconnected anomalous patterns in large networks. The proposed platform will enable integration and enrichment of limited private financial data with larger publicly available data sets to detect fraud and reduce losses due to fraudulent transactions. The project will also include training and research experience for undergraduate and graduate students.

The data linkage and financial pattern discovery platform which is to be developed via visual analytics will enable ""smart"" fraud detection and prevention services. Today, in order to obtain a single unified view of fraud activity across the enterprise and manage fraud on a cross-institution basis, fraud detection companies collect, verify, and analyze consumer data and financial information. Researchers recognize, however, that new insights into fraud and risk patterns require the ability to integrate financial data with domain independent data through real-time entity/identity discovery, resolution, cross-linking and schema mapping techniques. Therefore, the importance of the research discovery underpinning this project includes solving platform and processing challenges that arise from the need to integrate, filter, analyze, and visualize, in a secure and scalable manner, large private knowledge networks, also incorporating uncontrolled, unrestricted, untrusted, unstructured and unpredictable data from external domains. The ability to treat together financial and domain independent data will lead to enriched unified data, unprecedented predictive accuracy in fraud prevention and detection, and an entirely new suite of risk management services and products.

However, researchers recognize that new insights into fraud and risk patterns require the ability to integrate financial data with domain independent data through real-time entity/identity discovery, resolution, cross-linking and schema mapping techniques. Therefore, the importance of the research discovery includes solving platform and processing challenges that arise from the need to integrate, filter, analyze, and visualize, in a secure and scalable manner, large knowledge networks, also incorporating uncontrolled, unrestricted, untrusted, unstructured and unpredictable data from external domains.

Our proposed solution is to develop a smart complex financial patterns (CFP) discovery and fraud decision services platform, fSense. fSense will provide smart complex financial patterns (CFP) discovery and fraud decision services. fSense is enabling integration and enrichment (thru realtime entity/identity discovery, resolution, crosslinking and schema mapping techniques) of publicly available data sets and private financial data available to our partner, Early Warning. We developed new multi-view rare category detection,  matrix completion, tensor decomposition, local clustering and dense subgraph detection algorithms to enable financial analysts, executives and fraud managers detect fraud by utilizing publicly available data sets and private financial data.

Synthetic identity theft is the fastest growing type of ID fraud and costs around $50B to the businesses in the U.S. Money laundering is the process of transforming the proceeds of crime and corruption into ostensibly legitimate assets. In 1996, the International Monetary Fund estimated that 2&ndash;5% of the worldwide global economy involved laundered money. Spending on financial crime management solutions that anticipate, detect, analyze, and prevent fraudulent transactions, money laundering,   is set to reach $4.3 billion by 2015, up from $2.9 billion in 2010, according to a report from IDC. In cooperation with our industry partner, EarlyWarning Services LLC, we developed a star shaped multi-partite graph for modeling transactions, where the graph currently contains four types of nodes (Bank Brach, Account Holder, Account and Personally Identifiable information (PII)) and the edges representing transactions between Accounts and Bank Branches. Next, we developed algorithms for detecting instances of synthetic identity theft and money laundering.

We have developed the Hierarchical Dense Subgraph Detection algorithm to identify synthetic ID instances by detecting suspicious entities and their connections as dense blocks. Financial institutions could run this method in their global network regularly to detect synthetic identity suspects through our software then manually review these cases to reduce fraud. Dense subgraphs are fundamental patterns in graphs, and dense subgraph detection is often the key step of numerous graph mining applications. Most of the existing methods aim to find a single subgraph with a high density. However, dense subgraphs at different granularities could reveal more intriguing patterns in the underlying graph. In our SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM17), paper, we propose to hierarchically detect dense subgraphs. The key idea of our method (HiDDen) is to envision the density of subgraphs as a relative measure to its background (i.e., the subgraph at the coarse granularity). Given that the hierarchical dense subgraph detection problem is essentially a nonconvex quadratic programming problem, we propose effective and efficient alternative projected gradient based algorithms to solve it. The experimental evaluations on real graphs demonstrate that (1) our proposed algorithms find subgraphs with an up to 40% higher density in almost every hierarchy; (2) the densities of different hierarchies exhibit a desirable variety across different granularities; (3) our projected gradient descent based algorithm scales linearly w.r.t the number of edges of the input graph.

Multi-hop loop structures may indicate the existence of money laundering in financial networks We have developed the High-Order Structure Preserving Graph Cut algorithm to efficiently identify multi-hop loop structures when supplied a suspect node Using this method through our software, risk managers could verify the existence of such anomalies easily in real-time instead of manually tracing and reviewing very complex transactions. Many existing works on graph mining focus on the vertices and edges, with the first-order Markov chain as the underlying model. They fail to explore the high-order network structures, which are of key importance in many high impact domains. In our ACM SIGKDD Conference of Knowledge, Discovery, and Data Mining (KDD'2017) paper, we focus on mining user-specified high-order network structures and aim to find a structure-rich subgraph, which does not break many such structures by separating the subgraph from the rest. Furthermore, we analyze its performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. We experimental results on both synthetic graphs and real graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed HOSPLOC algorithms.

For example, stormwater can diminish water quality by discharging pollutants like metals and nutrients as it runs over land and into the streams. Stormwater causes stream erosion, sedimentation, flooding and overflows in combined sewer systems. To combat these issues, municipalities must adopt innovative technologies, such as Green Infrastructure (GI) systems like bioretention, constructed wetlands, and vegetated roofs. Despite the advantages of GI systems, its adoption has been slow due to technological and human factors. These systems are not yet dynamic, cannot adapt to seasonal changes and are often able to accomplish only one performance goal resulting in high implementation and maintenance costs. Other potential factors include operation and maintenance issues, policy and financing issues, lack of buy-in from different stakeholders, and unclear return on investment. This research will develop ""smart"" (i.e., efficient, active and self-learning) stormwater service systems. ""Smart"" systems use sensor- and human-generated data to streamline GI maintenance programs to be less costly and more effective in performance, prediction and failure prevention. The broader impacts of the research activities are the improvement of stormwater management across treatment scales. The research activities will lead to more efficient and economical GI that demonstrates its need and benefit to society and all watershed stakeholders by making major progress towards flood mitigation and water quality improvement in impaired waterbodies. The underlying technologies allow for unique opportunities to directly connect infrastructure to stakeholders, system data is transmitted, stored, and processed in cloud-based data management systems and published as web services. 

This project enlists a research-based approach that integrates application with the socio-technical system. This outcome will be achieved by optimally using all physical processes in a GI system (i.e., detention, infiltration, evapotranspiration), which uses sensors and controls integrated with real-time weather and system conditions, forecast data, and social media. Villanova University GI systems (green roof, constructed stormwater wetland, bioretention rain garden) will be equipped with sensors (e.g., soil moisture, water level, temperature and dissolved oxygen), as well as automated control structures (e.g., valves or gates), providing dynamic control algorithms that optimally operate during and after rain events. This GI system will be dynamically linked to a platform technology with real time visualization, data accessibility, quality assurance and real time control through physical computing. The entire automated system will operate at three time scales: 1) hours during, 2) days after the rain event, and 3) seasonal scale.  All control algorithms will be geared to maximize storage available for stormwater and water quality improvement. These goals will vary across season and climate zones.

These smart, real-time controls can help to optimize performance, self-correct and maximize efficiency of GI system, and minimize operation and maintenance costs. This is a new technology so there needs to be changes to policy to enable integration of smart systems in to the regulatory framework.

Key findings included two surveys of municipal officials and found that there is an appetite for smart, real-time control GI systems. The surveys highlighted that key problems with existing, passive stormwater infrastructure and that smart systems could help improve the efficacy and reduce the maintenance burden of green infrastructure. Further, water agencies are willing to pay a higher initial construction costs for a smart stormwater infrastructure system if maintenance costs are reduced and/or self-irrigation is added.  Another key finding was on the performance of smart GI systems. Monitoring data and analysis have shown that the sites are able to capture substantially more stormwater, reduce overflow volume over the watershed with the smart GI system, and modify the outflow hydrograph, relative to grey infrastructure and passive GI. For example, a green roof system with a cistern that increased the treatment area by 139% can increase the green roof capture volume by 157%. A third major finding is that machine learning can be applied to smart stormwater systems. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were trained to predict and balance evapotranspiration demands for irrigation to the green roof with long-term SPEI drought concerns, based on historical recorded data along with weather forecasts and publicly-available climate data. Another application of using ANNs is with a relatively small data set (10 storm events) with only rainfall and ponded depth (which is easy to measure) and no need for site specific geometry, a model was developed that yielded a predicted outflow response that had high accuracy. Further, the ANN was able to detect anomalies (either in rainfall depths or ponded depths), which showed that the system logic could correct for the anomaly and the alert of the anomaly would be helpful for maintenance and operation of stormwater systems. As stormwater green infrastructure has evolved and become widespread, the industry focus has substantially moved to understanding and making operation and maintenance more efficient and cost-effective. The industry is looking to use sensors and big data to aid in maintenance, and this work has demonstrated it can be done with minimal computational effort. Lastly, through this work, it was identified that the GI stormwater industry needs to develop a definition of failure and risk. A definition of risk was proposed through this work. Incorporating risk in to smart stormwater design creates more resilient systems. This work showed that using a real-time control GI system was able to reduce risk by increasing the adaptive capacity of the site to respond to storm events.

In addition to the technical findings that support smart stormwater systems, there has been much dissemination of this work at conferences (five distinct organizations' conferences, with multi-year presentations at three of them) and other industry forums. There have been two dissertations, two theses, two MS reports, and two undergraduate reports published. The publications and presentations has encouraged acceptance and implementation of these systems in industry. Additionally, the industry partner OptiRTC has worked with the regulatory community and obtained regulatory approvals from TAPE Approval and Chesapeake Bay.

The project will result in a prototype of an online mathematics curriculum wherein students apply learned math concepts to create digital games as an authentic transfer of learning. This game-making-based instructional innovation, GameMath, has the following unique features: a) It is game-activity driven, i.e., math concepts necessary to achieve gaming effects are taught/applied together, b) it incorporates diagnostic/prescriptive software so that it addresses even deeply At-Risk students, and c) it collects/analyzes student programming interactions within the game-making context for the purpose of assessing a student?s ability to transfer principles of mathematics.
These features provide the following advantages: They encourage practice/application of STEM skills mandated in new Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and Next Generation Science Standards, they engage students with the creative process and introduce game coding, and they address the unique needs of At-Risk students to help them recover to grade level proficiency and encourage them to continue studies in the STEM disciplines.  When compared to the leading competing technologies in this market space, including games that teach math, math tutoring systems, and hands-on engineering activities, GameMath encourages production, as opposed to consumption, of games and promises to be less expensive and easier to assess than robotics and other engineering based approaches to mathematics instruction.
The GameMath prototype is important because the focus of the product will be to promote academic achievement in secondary mathematics. As fully envisioned, the system will support a wide range of pre-algebra and algebra lesson plans based on the Common Core State Standards. Student exploration and manipulation of math concepts within a computer-games-programming environment has the potential to lead to greater interest in computer science.
The project engages computer science researchers at the University of Southern California (USC), CA, and education product specialists at N C Learning (NCL), NJ, who will collaborate to combine two technologies, both of which have been shown to improve mathematics learning for At-Risk students, to demonstrate and evaluate a prototype in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.
This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) Custom CCSS Grade Level Lesson Paths that Support GameMath activities, 2) Creation of game programming activities that apply CCSS grade level mathematics concepts, 3) Games programming assessments to evaluate activity-based learning , 4) Custom reporting that incorporates GameMath assessments into existing diagnostics, and 5) Run-time architecture-level integration. These gaps will be bridged via a new advance==>apply ==>assess concept pipeline that combines USC and NCL technologies.
The potential economic impact is expected to be greater student preparedness for and interest in pursuing careers in technology and engineering in the next 5 to 10 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in engineering and technology based industries.",,,"Consistent with proposal for award 1414404, PFI:AIR - TT: Games Programming Assessments for Personalized Mathematics Instruction, researchers have produced a prototype to confirm the technical feasibility of a 6th grade math curriculum designed to teach underperforming students math with highly interactive and personalized digital lessons integrated with software coding exercises.  While there are several initiatives to teach coding, the focus of this award is to teach core math skills in a way that is both more engaging for struggling learners and that develops a deeper understanding of math concepts by challenging students to confirm their proficiency in an authentic transfer of learning to real world applications of software code used to develop and modify video games.  Special ""Bridge Lessons"" were developed to introduce students to sufficient coding skills from the C++/Java family of languages to complete the application of math in the coding exercises. 

Perhaps most unique is that the prototype includes successful development of a scoring software module to scan, parse and score the code, and report to the teacher which students achieved mastery, near mastery, or failure of the math application.  It also provides the teacher with the specific line of code in which a student failed to apply the concept, so the teacher may intervene individually when needed.   The pedagogical implication is that the coding exercise becomes the assessment that measures a student?s proficiency in math skills that are aligned to Common Core State Standards.  The other implication is that the prototype is designed so that teachers need not spend time running programs, or searching through code.  In fact the teacher need not even have coding skills to integrate the math lesson software and coding exercises in their classroom.

Use of the prototype to teach the concept of percents, their calculation and application with under-performing fifth and sixth graders and with at-risk high school students, and their respective teachers, confirm the engaging nature of the approach and the acceptance of the teachers.  Feasibility testing took place in both California and New Jersey and included student game play and web-based tutoring program experience. Of particular focus were the exercises, which were applications of game design. Study included reading level, sequencing and conceptual understanding. Further feedback provided guidance as to the frequency of coding exercises per week (up to three) that was acceptable by the teachers, and the potential use of a fully developed 6th grade curriculum with ""flipped classroom"" models of instruction (likely). The study populations of both California and New Jersey consisted primarily of students of low socioeconomic status and traditionally underrepresented in STEM professions.

The outcomes of this research confirmed the technical feasibility and generated the initial classroom user input to guide further development toward a completed 6th grade math curriculum designed for use by math teachers with limited or no programming skills.  The limited scope of work with underperforming 5th and 6th graders and with at-risk High School students confirmed the engagement and student desire to do more such math lessons and their integrated coding exercises.  These students generally achieved success in applying the math calculation of percents in order to code the percent health of characters in the video game.  While promising, it will require further study to confirm the difference in student performance on independent math assessments versus control groups.  Longer- term research will be needed to determine whether this introduction to coding results in larger groups of inner-city at-risk students continuing their education in the post secondary STEM disciplines, as is desired. It will also require further research and observation with in-class students to guide and refine development of the prototype toward a compl...",UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

The project will result in a proof of concept of the proposed microfluidic adsorption technology for safe and efficient removal of bacterial endotoxin from blood. This technology has the following unique features: microscale architecture designed to enhance adsorption at the device surface and a biocompatible surface coating with strong binding affinity for bacterial pathogens in the presence of blood. These features will enable greatly improved adsorption efficiency, as well as improved safety and reduced damage to blood cells when compared to existing technologies for adsorption-based removal of blood constituents.    
  The microfluidic adsorption technology is important because it will enable improved treatment of a variety of medical conditions that are mediated by the blood, including sepsis, as well as autoimmune diseases such as lupus.  In particular, sepsis affects 750,000 people per year in the US and accounts for nearly $17 billion in treatment costs.  There is no cure for sepsis; approximately 1 in 3 people who develop sepsis will die.  Thus, clinical translation of the proposed technology will have important ramifications for both patient health and treatment costs.  The potential economic impact is a platform technology for safe and efficient removal of blood constituents, with a product targeting removal of endotoxin anticipated in the next 5 years. This will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in medical devices for blood processing.  
  Because numerous medical conditions are mediated by the blood, extracorporeal devices for targeted removal of specific blood constituents offer enormous therapeutic potential. However, a common challenge faced by such an approach is the efficient removal of target entities without damaging blood cells. To overcome this challenge we plan to develop highly parallelized microfluidic devices that are capable of operating at clinically relevant flow rates, with a microscale geometry that is optimized for harnessing red blood cell migration to enhance adsorption at the device surface. To ensure biocompatibility and selective adsorption, the internal surface of the device will be coated with a nonfouling polyethylene oxide (PEO) brush layer, and a bioactive agent with high binding affinity for bacterial pathogens will be immobilized to the PEO chain ends.",,,"Because numerous medical conditions are mediated by the blood, extracorporeal devices for targeted removal of specific blood constituents offer enormous therapeutic potential.  For example, removal of autoantibodies by passing blood over a sorbent has shown promise for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as lupus, and similar extracorporeal adsorption strategies have been investigated for various other conditions, including high cholesterol, liver failure and sepsis.  Despite the significant promise of this treatment strategy, problems with inefficient adsorption and damage to blood cells are significant obstacles to more widespread use of such technologies. 

 

These problems can be attributed to non-optimal surface properties and flow conditions within the device. The most common sorbent-based blood processing approach is to pass whole blood or plasma through a column packed with sorbent beads. Passing whole blood through such a column is associated with severe complications, including depletion of platelets and white blood cells, clotting and systemic bleeding. An alternative approach is to first separate plasma from the cellular components of blood and then pass it through a sorbent column. While this avoids damage to blood cells in the column, the plasma separation process itself can be damaging and the resulting two-step process adds complexity and cost and reduces efficiency.

 

This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focused on developing technology to overcome these challenges, with an emphasis on the removal of endotoxin for the treatment of sepsis, a blood infection that affects 750,000 people per year in the US and accounts for nearly $17 billion in treatment costs. The device concept is based on highly parallelized microfluidic channels - allowing operation at clinically relevant flow rates - with a microscale geometry optimized for harnessing red blood cell (RBC) migration to enhance adsorption at the device surface. An additional key feature of the device is a biocompatible surface coating for selective adsorption of endotoxin based on a nonfouling polyethylene oxide (PEO) brush layer with bioactive agents immobilized to the PEO chain ends.

 

The proposed device architecture involves an array of microfluidic channels with periodic bifurcations. It was hypothesized that shear-induced red blood cell (RBC) movement within the microfluidic channels would enhance lateral mixing and lead to improved capture of endotoxin at the device sidewalls. To test this hypothesis a new method was developed for rapid prototyping of plastic devices with deep (high aspect ratio) microfluidic channels by laser machining and hot embossing. The resulting high aspect ratio devices were tested for endotoxin removal from blood, using arrays of either straight or bifurcated microchannels. The results suggest that, under certain conditions, bifurcations improve adsorption of endotoxin onto the walls of the device.

 

Blood-contacting plastics and other synthetic material surfaces must be chemically modified to protect host cells and proteins from undesirable surface interactions that lead to clotting, platelet activation, and other damage. Simultaneously, coatings in a blood-processing device must provide one or more biological activities (e.g. anticoagulant, pathogen binding, etc.)  We developed a PEO brush coating approach based on FDA-approved surfactants, which can be applied by a simple, inexpensive aqueous dip coating process. Small synthetic endotoxin-binding peptides (WLBU2) were chemically attached to the reactive endgroups of the polymer chains by dip coating in a peptide solution. The resulting coating repels blood proteins and cells for biocompatibility, and binds substantial amounts of endotoxin rapidly and stably from flowing buffer and plasma, under laboratory conditions.

These proof-of-concept studies lay the groundwork for continued development of this technology, which has the potential to dramatically improve treatment of sepsis, as well as a range of other medical conditions that are mediated by the blood.

This project addresses technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application, specifically: (i) gaining a better insight about the characteristics of each individual technology subsystem (PoFR and PhoR), but also how they potentially function together as an integrated technology; (ii) acquiring a better understanding of the reaction/transport processes that occur during contaminant  destruction; (iii) developing an effective process model to be able to optimize performance without the need of extensive and costly experimentation; (iv) field-testing of the technology to validate its ability to function with real LFG and biogas; (v) process modeling to demonstrate process feasibility 

The project engages three principal partners, the University of Southern California (USC) and two small US companies, Media and Process Technology, Inc. of Pittsburgh, PA (M&PT), and GC Environmental, Inc. of Anaheim, CA (GCE) working as a team to develop this novel cost-effective clean-up method to remove toxic contaminants from LFG and biogas. The project will engage three additional broader-context partners, namely the EISGTTP Program at San Diego State University (guiding commercialization aspects), and a small business (BENA) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas), both providing test environments, all working together towards a common goal of the translation of this technology from research discovery toward commercial reality.

This novel clean-up technology is important because it will allow LFG and biogas to gain their full potential as renewable fuels; it also shows promise for widespread application, beyond the LFG/biogas market, for volatile organic compounds (VOC) destruction in contaminated gas streams, encountered in many energy and industrial applications. This technology will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the renewable energy and environmental fields by providing superior treatment capability allowing engines, combustion and process equipment to experience longer life with less maintenance.",,,"The major goal of the present NSF PFI:AIR-TT project was to carry out early translational-research activities that involve completing the validation of the proof-of-concept of the technology that was conceived and first investigated under the auspices of the previous NSF-GOALI project  both at the lab-scale and the field-scale, a key step towards the translation of the research discovery into a market-valued solution. Our ultimate goal is to develop a novel technology that will allow LFG/biogas to gain their full potential as renewable fuels, and with promise for widespread application, beyond the LFG/biogas market, for VOC destruction in contaminated gas streams, encountered in many energy and industrial applications.

 The following are some of the key outcomes of our project to date:

Composite membranes, consisting of ceramic thin layers deposited on macroporous substrates, which provide mechanical support, have been prepared and rendered catalytic by the deposition of nanocatalysts, and have been characterized by various surface techniques. Multi-tubular bundles have been prepared and rendered catalytic as well. 
The resulting PoFR have been utilized to successfully degrade toxic compounds in simulated LFG. A mathematical model for the PoFR has been developed and utilized for further scale-up and design, and for the economic evaluation of the technology. The model has also been used to compare the behavior of the PoFR with that of the more conventional (e.g., monolith) reactors.
The decomposition of volatile siloxanes in LFG has been studied in the PhoR and a better fundamental understanding has been developed. A mathematical model for the PhoR has been developed and utilized for hypothetical process design. The model has been validated with experimental data with the lab-scale PhoR system.  
A prototype PhoR system has been designed and sized and key system components have been selected and purchased. An appropriate field-testing site has been selected.  The prototype unit has been constructed and field-testing was initiated and completed.  
Hypothetical process design simulations have been carried out for a full-scale system. They show distinct economic and environmental advantages over the ""state-of-the-art"" adsorption system. 


In terms of broader Impacts, in this project a novel landfill gas and biogas clean-up technology, based on the PoFR and PhoR concepts, has been developed and has been utilized successfully at the lab-scale and on the field to degrade toxic compounds in simulated LFG. The research has enabled significant gains in the understanding of two novel reactor systems, and has contributed as well to the development of new techniques for the preparation of composite catalytic membranes.  The novel (PoFR-PhoR) based technology has potential broad applications in the chemical industry in general, and the environmental field in particular. The research is, potentially, transformative as a new technique for LFG clean-up that overcomes the current challenges that conventional clean-up technologies face in this area. LFG is potentially an important renewable fuel. Unfortunately, today only a relatively small fraction is utilized for electric power and energy generation, because of the potential for equipment corrosion and eventual failure. The novel reactor technology under development in this project, if adopted by the industry, will offer significant economic, environmental, and energy advantages, and will allow LFG (and biogas in general) to gain its full potential as a valuable renewable fuel.

 This project has trained one PhD student and three MS research students. We have also trained one undergraduate student, who assisted throughout the project with the lab-scale experiments, and four other undergraduate students, who carried out a modeling reactor design project as part of their Reactor Design class. This is an NSF-AIR-TT project, and therefore also provided the students involved with it the opportunity to interact with industrial researchers. For our industrial partners and collaborators the project provided access to newly-developed fundamental tools of discovery.

 We have presented three technical paper, an invited talk at the Applied Energy Sub-UNiLAB Kick-off Meeting in 2017, a plenary talk at the 12th International Conference on Catalysis in Membrane Reactors, in 2015, and a poster paper at the 2015 NSF-AIR-TT Grantees Meeting.  A fourth paper will be presented at the International Symposium in Chemical Reaction Engineering in 2018. We have also been issued a US Patent in 2017.  A PhD Thesis was published in the Fall 2017.  Two technical papers will be submitted in early January, 2018.

The project will result in a proof-of-concept for the manufacturing scalability of NIL-membranes. A NIL-membrane has the unique feature of regular, submicron surface patterns, which are mechanically embossed on existing commercial membranes, while retaining the original membranes' permselective separation properties. These features provide the advantages of higher energy efficiency, lower operating costs, and no chemical waste generation when compared to the leading competing approach of chemically modifying the membrane's surface. This project addresses the scale-up technology gap(s) required to translate the research discovery toward commercial application. In particular, the fabrication and use of flexible, low cost, polymeric patterning molds for manufacturing NIL-membranes?using continuous, pressure and temperature application required for industrial manufacturing equipment?has never been studied or demonstrated. The project will conduct proof-of-concept research and development (on a 6"" pilot scale) to fabricate flexible patterning films; use those films in a pinch roll embossing process to fabricate larger-sized NIL-membranes; and evaluate these prototype membranes for specific industrial applications.

The project partners with the Innovation Center of the Rockies and Water Think Tank, LLC to guide commercialization aspects. Additionally, a number of other food and membrane companies have been actively engaged with the research as stakeholders to augment testing the larger membranes to be produced in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.

The NIL-membrane platform is important because synthetic membranes are broadly used in water, food, biopharma, petrochemical, fossil and renewable energy, microelectronics, medical, and other consumer-oriented industries to perform ""filtration"" with varying degrees of ""fineness"" and complexity. Productivity enhancements from the NIL-membranes will lower costs, save energy, and lessen environmental impacts, thus accelerating the benefits of membrane-based processes across areas such as, water supply and reuse, food and energy production, and biomedicine manufacture. In addition, the potential economic impact is expected to be $40M/y in the next 5 years (and grow 7-8%/y thereafter), which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the global membrane supply market space.","J.

Consequently, membrane material improvements can lower both the overall costs, for consumers, and the sustainability of the processes they serve. For example, greater amounts of milk proteins (whey) could be economically recovered from raw milk if the membranes used in the process required less frequent and harsh cleaning.

The co-PIs had discovered that one can directly imprint submicron-sized patterns on commercial microporous (ultrafiltration, UF) membranes and retain the membrane's properties of flux (productivity) and rejection (selective retention). These membranes are referred to as NIL-membranes. This earlier work had only fabricated small samples, using expensive silcon wafer-based patterns, suitable for bench-top experimentation. Nonetheless, it was the first demonstration of a non-chemical, post-membrane manufacture, surface modification of a commercial material that lowered its fouling

This PFI:AIR - TT: Scalable NIL-membranes award enabled the first proof-of-concept demonstration of nanoimprinting polymeric membranes using flexible polymeric patterns to produce larger-sized samples of functioning membranes for evaluation by future commercial end-users. Over the lifetime of the award, we created the fundamental knowledge, prototype equipment and operating protocols that enables translation of the original discovery to a commonplace industrial manufacturing technique, roll-to-roll (R2R) imprinting. The scientific outputs of the award included a published MS thesis elucidating the fundamental rationales for how nanoscale patterns provide the operating advantages for membranes; a scientific publication describing the ""how-to-knowledge"" and scale-up experiences and data, and three presentations at major membrane conferences venues. An additional PhD thesis is in progress, as well as, two further manuscripts being readied.

In addition to the direct societal value of the supported research, the broad-based benefits of this project included 10 diverse, undergraduate students engaged in designing, building, and operating the prototype experimental equipment, which produced flexible patterns and performed R2R nanoimprinting, as well as, performing detailed experimental measurements. Furthermore, partial support for the training of two graduate students and a post-doctoral associate was also provided. During the course of the award, we had interactions with several companies, and one small company has licensed the University's underlying IP and will be driving initial commercialization efforts.

For years, chemists and materials scientists have been working to design a biocompatible adhesive that can seal tissue inside the wet environment of the human body. A polymer with the desired characteristics (strong wet adhesion, nontoxic and non-immunogenic, stable under physiological conditions, and flexible for use with soft organs and membranes) has now been synthesized at Caltech. This PFI: BIC project will focus on completing the early translational research tasks (in vivo efficacy and biocompatibility demonstrations; optimization of glue chemistry and formulation for mass-production) to take this discovery to a practicable, market-valued solution that will fill the presently unmet need for a biomedical adhesive that works in wet conditions. This process will also involve development of a novel delivery device that incorporates advances in sensor technology to detect the proper location for glue deposition inside the body.

The broader impacts of this research include enabling new and safer procedures in several areas of medicine (prenatal diagnosis and therapy, vascular surgery, drug delivery, tissue engineering) as well as development of a new class of devices with self-contained sensing mechanisms that enable controlled access and/or delivery of a substance to a precise location in the body. This project also provides opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students to participate in the exciting process of translating research discoveries to realities and to witness first-hand the potential for innovation that can be realized by integrating academic and industry knowledge from multiple fields. Small business partners will benefit from a competitive advantage in the new market niches created from development of the adhesive and sensing delivery device, creation of new intellectual property, and development of new technical capabilities and expertise, resulting in increased innovation capacity and competitiveness.
Partners at the inception of the project are lead academic institution University of California, San Francisco (Departments of Surgery and Bioengineering & Therapeutic Sciences); small technology-based business partners: Modified Polymer Components, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA) and Bay Materials, LLC (Menlo Park, CA); and collaborating academic partner California Institute of Technology (Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering). Other partners include educational partners California Maritime Academy (Vallejo, CA); Saint Ignatius College Preparatory (San Francisco, CA); San Francisco International High School; San Francisco State University College of Engineering; University of California, Berkeley, College of Engineering; the UCSF Center for Educational Partnerships; and the UCSF Office of Diversity and Outreach.",,,"The NSF Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity project between UCSF, Caltech, and small business partners Modified Polymer Components and Bay Materials aimed to develop a novel biocompatible glue for medical usage as a surgical sealant. The project lies at the intersection of chemistry, engineering, and medicine, and brought together leading scientists and researchers in the fields of polymer chemistry/bioadhesives, BioMEMS, and fetal surgery. There is presently a large need for medical adhesives that can seal tissue inside the aqueous environment of the human body. Such a material would have broad applications in fetal intervention, wound closures, sealing air leaks after pulmonary resections, pre-sealing the dura against leaks of cerebro-spinal fluid after spinal or epidural puncture, and pre-sealing vascular punctures for catheter-guided procedures, to name just a few. This project focused on developing a glue and delivery strategy for the specific context of fetoscopic and invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures (amniocentesis) in order to prevent the common complication of preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) by ""pre-sealing"" the amniotic membranes prior to access.

The primary goals of the project were to (1) optimize the glue chemistry through benchtop and in vivo testing with respect to regulatory requirements and clinical applicability and (2) design and prototype a delivery system compatible with the glue?s physical properties that could guide the glue delivery to the desired location without the need for external imaging. We have synthesized several new polymers with characteristics that have the potential to be advantageous to many different medical applications. These  include both N-methacryloyl 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (MDOPA)-based formulations and lower critical solution temperature (LCST)-based ""Amnioseals."" Early syntheses of the MDOPA-based polymers showed strong adhesive properties in wet conditions, but did not pass cytotoxicity assays and were not easily hydrolyzed. We then moved towards developing LCST-based Amnioseals, which would not require cross-linking polymers to maintain their adhesive and biocompatible properties. Development and optimization of this class of materials is ongoing.

Additionally, work on the delivery device is continuing at the small technology company H-Cubed, with whom we collaborated on a successful NIH SBIR grant proposal to develop ultrasonic micro-transducers that can be used to precisely deliver the glue without disturbing the fragile chorioamniotic membrane. We remain ready to test promising formulations and delivery systems in our refined bench and animal models at UCSF.

In addition to the intellectual merit of this project, it has had significant broader educational impacts. The project has provided rich training experiences for two surgical residents, four postdoctoral scholars, four graduate students, one medical student, and three undergraduate students within UCSF and Caltech as well as neighboring institutions such as San Jose State University, San Francisco State University, UC Berkeley, and University of Southern California. Trainees gained exposure to various aspects of the chemistry, engineering, and medical components of the project. The project has also sparked new collaborative efforts within academia and industry, most notably the Messersmith Lab at UC Berkeley, who is also developing an amniotic sealant but from a different chemistry approach, and the Cleveland-based microsystems company H-Cubed.

These designs enable the development of MRI systems that reduce significantly the use of helium. To understand this significance, global shortages in helium and the predictions that the situation is only going to get worse have seriously affected both industry and government. The report by the National Academy of Science in 2010 predicted that demand would exceed world supply by 2017. Up to now, liquid helium has been necessary to surround the MRI main magnets in a sufficiently cold 'bath' for their wire to be 'superconducting'. It is noted that superconductivity is crucial as it eliminates electrical power losses, enables high magnetic fields, and keeps the MRI operating under the ultra-stable conditions needed for high-quality imaging. The design breakthroughs for 0.5-3 Tesla magnetic field strengths prove that new higher-temperature superconducting material can be used for the MRI wire bundles, and the large helium bath can be eliminated. The intellectual merit lies in successfully modeling the MRI machine in order, for example, to find the exact mathematical placement of wire bundles that leads to the most uniform magnetic field possible with the least amount of superconductor wire. Three decades of work at CWRU have resulted in a unique and proven design technology for optimizing MRI coil magnets and hardware.

The broader impacts of this research are significant. The world has already seen curtailment in standard MRI main-magnet manufacturing of high magnetic field MRI machines because of higher helium prices. If the global use of helium for MRIs is not reduced, the cost of MRI imaging will go up for the public. This will likely reduce the usage of MRI at a time of expressed desire for the expansion of human healthcare. Academic and industrial budgets for superconducting magnet research have been hard hit by increased helium costs. A MRI main magnet with no liquid helium bath, yet with performance rivaling the standard shielded 1.5-Tesla superconducting MRI system, will have significant impact on the global market place. The two primary partners, Hyper Tech and Quality Electrodynamics, and five other companies (ViewRay Inc., AllTech Medical Systems, GE Healthcare, Philips Healthcare, and Toshiba Medical Systems) which have prepared strong letters of interest, provide evidence of this impact through their expressed enthusiasm for the project target. The immediate takeaway for Hyper Tech, as a primary partner, is a final set of prototype-ready magnet blueprints, with both high and low magnetic field options, and a viable commercialization path for an important application of its superconducting wire product. For Quality Electrodynamics, the other primary partner, the takeaways start with the support hardware designs for the complete MRI system, as new manufacturing products, and extend to a possible major partnership with Hyper Tech for in-house main magnet manufacturing. Additionally, all 7 firms not only seek to participate in this exciting technical venture, they also want an inside track to recruiting the next generation of highly educated imaging personnel trained in the program. Upwards of 60 undergraduates, graduate, and postgraduate MRI alumni, including the entrepreneurial degree holders, have come out of the CWRU physics group, many of whom now work with a dozen companies that have partnered with the group throughout the years. Future students as well as new MRI magnets are key outcomes of the present MRI design program.

Partners at the inception of the project are the lead academic institution and the two primary small business partners. The principal unit of the lead institution is Ohio Platform for Tomorrow's Industrial Medical Imaging Systems and Equipment
(OPTIMISE) in the CWRU physics department. OPTIMISE is an outgrowth of a long and rich history of research and education carried out with other CWRU units: the biomedical engineering, chemistry, mathematics, and radiology departments, and the CWRU pioneering entrepreneurial physics master's degree program. The two technology-based business partners are Hyper Tech Inc. (Columbus, Ohio) and Quality Electrodynamics (QED) LLC (Mayfield Village, Ohio).","C. Poole, T. Baig, R. J. Deissler, and M.

Over the lifetime of a MRI systems, between 1,000 to 2,000 liters of liquid helium may be consumed. With a projected increase in demand for helium, a magnet design which used only a few liters of helium would be desirable. Such a magnet would also facilitate the use of MRI systems in remote locations where the supply of helium is limited. 

One major accomplishment has been the design of a magnet for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems which requires much less helium (about 1 liter) to operate than the MRI systems typically used in hospitals today. The design was facilitated by technological advances in the manufacturing of superconducting wire used in these strong magnet. This work was performed as a collaboration between the physics department at Case Western Reserve University and Hyper Tech, Inc which manufacture the magnesium diboride (MgB2) wire enabling this magnet design.

The second major accomplishment of this project has been the development and commercialization of a RF coil system used in MRI for breast imaging and breast biopsies. The system allows for a guided breast biopsy to be performed immediately after a patient has completed the MRI scan and improves the ability to accurately collect a biopsy specimen. This work was in collaboration with Quality Electrodynamics, Inc. which manufactures MRI RF coils and systems for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of MRI systems.

In the process of design a new type of MRI magnet, and the breast biopsy RF coil system, three PhD students in physics, and one PhD student in mechanical engineering had the opportunity to advance these technological advances, and are well prepared to contribute to the field and industry of medical imaging.

Oxygen sensors are currently the most extensively used sensor in the combustion industry. These sensors are used for controlling fuel injection in gasoline-powered vehicles (cost of sensors ~ $100) and optimizing combustion in coal-fired power plants (cost of sensor ~ $5000). Currently, the dimensions of these sensor systems range from ten centimeters to meters in size and require access to ambient air, thus limiting their use in a wide range of industries. Miniaturization of existing sensor designs only will be advantageous if new designs no longer need access to ambient air. The recent discovery of an oxygen sensor by Argonne National Laboratory and The Ohio State University with unsurpassed oxygen-sensing capabilities and no need for access to outside air, provides a unique opportunity to further adapt miniaturization for designing innovative chemical gas sensors. The intellectual merit of this program is realized in filling the technology gap related to the development of microfabrication techniques for producing millimeter- sized oxygen gas sensors with the necessary technical and cost attributes required for widespread use within combustion applications. To meet this objective, manufacturing practices for macroscopic ceramic objects will be translated to the nanometer length scale, which will increase the innovation capacity of the research team. 

The broader impacts of this research will be realized in the commercial impact of microfabricated oxygen sensors. Use of these miniaturized sensors will increase the combustion efficiency of energy systems in industries that include transportation, energy generation, and manufacturing.  An increase of just 1% in combustion efficiency will provide energy savings of 160 TBtu with a subsequent CO2 reduction of 93 million tons, saving billions of dollars in the long run with a major impact on a cleaner environment. For the small business collaborator, Makel Engineering, Inc.( MEI), these sensors can be used immediately in low volume/high cost industrial applications. In the long term, mass-produced sensor dies will allow for a reduction in production costs that will then open up low cost/high volume chemical sensor applications. For the small business collaborator, MicroAdventure Technologies LLC (MAT), the successful completion of the MEMS oxygen sensor project will allow MAT to participate in the subsequent development phases needed to bring this sensor technology to market. Longer term, MAT intends to participate in the supply chain for this sensor by providing custom-designed and tested die to application-focused companies. For the academic members of the research team, the translation of laboratory discoveries into research initiatives aimed at building the innovation capacity of small businesses will in turn provide new educational opportunities for both the academic investigators and students. The entrepreneurial spirit of this research program will provide a unique opportunity for training of graduate and undergraduate students and the groundwork for future success in both academic and business-related opportunities.

Real-time sensing can be revolutionized if: 1) the high cost of providing an external reference for sensors is minimized, 2) miniaturized sensors at a fraction of the costs of current sensors can be manufactured and 3) built in multi-functionality on a common sensor platform can be developed. Towards this goal, we have taken an oxygen sensor developed by Argonne National Laboratory and The Ohio State University with a self-contained reference gas system and adapted MEMS-based fabrication technology for designing and developing miniaturized O2 sensors. Introduction of semiconductor industry-based manufacturing practices to O2 sensor technology has resulted in miniaturization, removed the need for an external air reference, thereby eliminating high temperature plumbing and fittings and reducing the overall size of the sensor package by ~3 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, this development will enable the placement of the sensor, or arrays of multiple sensors for faster and more accurate environment control monitoring and a more rapid response for feedback control. The intellectual merit that this program has demonstrated includes showing that hydrophilic bonding of silicon samples which have been patterned with Pt electrodes and a YSZ membrane separating the oxygen reference material PdO is feasible. At elevated temperatures the electrochemical detection of oxygen has been demonstrated and future design concepts and changes have been outlined to further improve the device functionality.

 

These new manufacturing practices for translating macroscopic ceramic objects to the micron length scale have led to a sensing platform that can be expanded to a combination of sensors on the same platform.  The broader impacts of this program are realized by noting 1) the wafer level MEMS production of O2 sensors on a common device platform is realized and 2) several thousand such sensing devices per 150mm silicon wafer substrate can be produced. With these device volumes, projected sensor costs of $3-5/device are plausible. The evolution of this program will be future implementation and translational development of what can be likened to a plug-n-play electrochemical sensing device on a microfabricated platform for a variety of different gases, coupled with the dramatic reduction in sensor device cost, and represents a transformational change in gas sensor development paradigm.

It functions more like magnetic tomography than a conventional MRI, in that the magnetic fields from the subject are imaged directly. It can be made portable, and it will be relatively inexpensive compared to MRI. 

The broader impacts of this research include applications and research in areas as diverse as medical imaging for head trauma, industrial product inspection, agricultural pest control, scientific study of biological processes, ground penetrating imaging, and agricultural product inspection. The nuclear moment imager has the potential to affect many areas of everyday life in such widely varying areas as medicine, agriculture, science, industrial inspection, and other areas yet to be envisioned. One particularly exciting potential application is in third world countries, where the availability of a relatively inexpensive MRI-like imager that could travel with mobile medical teams could change the way ""bush medicine"" is practiced. The NMI platform and Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI: BIC) research will be housed as a part of the recently formed Center for Innovation Translation. This center allows students to move real-world research projects rapidly to the early prototype stage, thus educating them in early-stage high-tech startup skills, contributing to the overall regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. 

Partners at the inception of the project: University of Florida with the Microfabritech/Center for Innovation Translation, Materials Science and Engineering, Physics, Mathematics, Biomedical Engineering, and Radiology departments participating; Small businesses:  Anitraks (Gainesville, FL),an imaging software development firm;  Synogen (Gainesville, FL), a medical device development firm; and Medical Tool & Technology (Hawthorne, FL), a medical device prototype manufacturer.

All materials have a magnetic response, and thus all will respond to a magnetic field. The magnetic response of the nucleus of atoms is the basis for the MMI developed in this project. By exposing a target to a magnetic field of even a few mT (about 1000 times that of the earth?s magnetic field), the response can be detected as a change in the magnetic field generated in target. The rate at which this induced magnetic moment decays can be monitored by the equilibrium change in the MMI detector. With this information it is possible to differentiate between areas of different atomic composition or structure by differences in their decay time. To form an image, a way to determine the points in space from which the magnetic fields are coming. In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) this is most commonly done by applying a gradient to the magnetic fields applied over the targe. By using directional detector in our MMI technique, no external variation is needed. The positon of the detector itself gives spatial information on the target being examined.  It is for this reason that atomic optical magnetometers have been utilized in this experiment. The detection of these devices is directional and they are very sensitive.  With knowledge of the directionality of the detectors, existing computer tomography technologies, and algorithms newly developed for this project, we have shown that it is possible to recreate a visual representation of the internal structure of even a complex system such as a fruit undergoing FDA inspection or a human brain being examined for signs of trauma. The results are be comparable to an MRI T1 (spin-lattice relaxation) image, with the advantage that the MMI does not require large magnets, expensive cryogenics, or confined spaces.  In addition, the MMI technique is expected to take only seconds to create the images.
This directionality had not been extensively experimentally reported but is key to the operation of this imager. Non-directional (Isotropic) detectors are common, but will not be useful in creating an image since it is not possible to reverse calculate the image effectively (figures 1 &amp; 2)
 
IN addition, atomic magnetometers are much more sensitive that other magnetic detectors, capable of detecting fields about a billion times smaller than the earth?s magnetic field.  This leads to an overall reduction in the strength of the magnetic coils needed to produce some kind of internal imaging. This reduction in strength of the magnetic coils would also lead to a decreasing need for magnetically shielded rooms and safety concerns that are produced by large magnetic fields in the medical environment . Some shielding would, of course, still be needed but it would be to prevent stray fields from impacting the imaging device or washing out the desired signal, not to prevent injury or damage to the apparatus being used.
It is this combination of high sensitivity, small size, and rapid processing that will allow the decay time of even extremely small fields to be detected and used to create a magnetically induced image. 
To be clear, although the aim is to produce images that would provide similar data as an MRI T1 scan would, it is different principles that are being exploited to do so. 
In MMI, the target of examination is given a magnetic pulse by a coil causing the target to develop an induced magnetic moment which varies in space and time. This magnetic moment in the target to me imaged can be detected by the magnetometers.  Using a mathematical model described by the phyics of the detector, we can convert the signals detected by an array of detectors into an image of the target.

A collaboration between the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), Wharton, and the Mack Institute for Innovation, the Y-Prize competition exposes hundreds of students yearly to transformative research and the challenges associated with technology transfer. Unlike in traditional business or technology competitions, Y-Prize teams compete to develop applications for existing technological solutions developed in university research laboratories. Innovation occurs in the problem space instead of the solution space.

The three goals of the Y-Prize competition are: a) Expose a wide range of students within and outside of engineering to emerging technology and to shine the spotlight on the opportunities in research labs on campus; b) Educate university students on the challenges inherent with technology transfer in research laboratories and engage them in technological innovation; and c) Develop and evaluate a new methodology for innovation based on cutting-edge university research which dramatically increases the number of students engaged in technology transfer.

The yearly competition includes lectures, demonstrations, networking events and virtual hangouts. Teams are first exposed to the technology, then provided guidance on the ideation process, and proposal development. Finalist teams are chosen based on the strength of their application proposals by a panel of judges from industry and academia. The finalists are then paired with a technology consultant (graduate student researcher) and a business consultant (Wharton MBA student). The competition culminates in a ""Shark Tank"" like Finale where finalists pitch and defend their applications to the judging panel. The yearly Y-Prize winner receives a monetary prize and a non-exclusive license to the technology.

The inaugural Y-Prize competition focused on aerial, modular and ground robotics technology from the GRASP Lab.  The winning team, Identified Technologies, founded a company and has received significant funding to use aerial robots to map job sites.   In 2014, the competition shifted focus from robotics to nanotechnology and the finalist teams proposed ways to detect fracking fluid in ground water and identify counterfeit prescription drugs. The 2015-16 competition, supported wholly by private funds, kicked off on September 28th, 2015 and addresses challenges in biomedical devices and systems. Since the competitions inception, almost 40 applications have been proposed and over 700 individuals exposed to innovative research and technology.

The Y-Prize competition has not only changed the way university members view the commercialization process but also has had a direct impact on the relationship between researchers and the Center for Technology Transfer (now Penn Center for Innovation). A Penn Center for Innovation staff member serves on the Y-Prize planning committee and provides critical insights during all phases of the competition. By offering winning teams a non-exclusive license to University technology, conversations about technology licensing take place earlier and mutually beneficial connections are formed.  The Y-Prize competition has been integral to shaping the way researchers bring their technology out of the lab and share their knowledge with the greater university community.

These applications will be generated utilizing a new platform technology of nanoparticle ionic materials (NIMs) discovered at Cornell. NIMs consist of inorganic core particles wrapped within a dense layer of organic molecules. Tethering mobile molecules to the tiny particle cores yields a family of nanoscale materials whose properties can be tuned to conduct electrical charge or serve as a lubricant, while not releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) because NIMs are solvent-free. Thus, used as lithium battery electrolytes, NIMs can be designed to provide competitive electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability for high performance, while eliminating the risks of conventional battery electrolytes employing flammable solvents. Likewise, in applications as lubricants, ultra-slippery gel-like NIMs greases and oils can be designed to enhance energy efficiency and longevity of high-performance machine components that present small tolerances and commensurate high contact pressures, yet demand stable lubricant mechanical properties over extended periods of time.

The broader impacts of this project are enhancement of education and entrepreneurship, and an improvement in U.S. economic competitiveness. Since this project will facilitate commercial deployment of new hybrid materials in two high-growth technology sectors: electrical energy storage and high performance machinery (e.g. wind-turbines, heavy-duty trucks, and high-speed rail), significant economic multiplication of the initial funding investment is expected. For education and entrepreneurship, the project will educate engineering researchers in the structure-property-performance relationships of NIMs in partnership with both industrial partners interested in the scaling up of NIMs production and performance and with Johnson School of Business graduate students, who will assist project participants in adapting NIMs for these new applications and in transitioning these technologies to the marketplace. More broadly, interactions of the project participants with K-12, Research Experience for Undergraduates, Research Experience for Teachers, and Women in Engineering programs organized by the Cornell Center for Materials Research and the College of Engineering will significantly expand the educational experiences provided by the project.

In this project we have focused on materials for a) more efficient energy storage devices (batteries) and b) lubricants for energy production (wind turbines) and energy efficiency (industrial gears). The work on electrolytes is motivated by recent interest to develop practical and safe lithium batteries for various portable electronic devices and hybrid electric vehicles. A feature that has become extremely important for automotive and electronic applications is electrolytes with low flammability and toxicity in order to avoid potential fire hazards especially in the event of an accident. Energy efficient synthetic gear lubricants could maximize the energy available to meet ever growing demand. Working with our partners we have demonstrated new hybrid electrolyte and lubricant systems that outperform state-of-art materials that are used currently in the industry.

 Another key program outcome, facilitated by the collaboration between the engineers, the Johnson School of Management students and our industrial partners, is researchers prepared to innovate in industries ranging from small start-ups to global corporations. As such the program has had a significant impact - both in terms of the science and technology innovations and the students? training and education. In addition, the program has established a new model of engagement with industry and catalyzed innovation in a field of significant economic impact. Finally, the program has enabled rapid technology validation and impacted knowledge transfer to industry, which we expect to translate into rapid commercialization and deployment.

The proposed partnership focuses on the design and evaluation of smart grid sensing and control hardware and software that enable demand response programs to offer customer choices for efficient use of electricity at all levels.  This capability is to be built through the development of a platform consisting of optimization- control algorithms and product conceptual designs based on electric utility requirements and customer preferences.  The hardware designs include a smart power management system and wireless sensor-control devices for 240-Volt end-use appliances, which are necessary to implement efficient and flexible electricity demand control programs.  The intellectual merit of this research is the design of advanced control and sensing technologies and algorithms that can serve as the interface between a utility and its customers to enable the implementation of cost-effective demand response programs while providing customer choice.

The broader impacts of this research are (1) a potentially stronger local economy as a result of the innovative design of new alpha-prototype products that could lead to electric energy saving products in the future; (2) a local job creation opportunity through the development of a new line of business for the partner companies and others; and, most important, (3) a viable improvement in the economy at a national level as a result of more efficient operation of the power grid by coordinating supply and demand in an optimal manner.  The proposed platform will allow the electric utility to operate its assets more efficiently, and, at the same time, will allow its customers to manage their power consumption without compromising their lifestyle or way of life.   In addition, this project has received strong support from two public sector organizations in Virginia: the Arlington County government and the Center for Advanced Research and Engineering (CAER).  The County of Arlington is in the process of developing a Community Energy Plan, which is expected to recommend extensive use of energy efficient devices and smart grid technologies to optimize the use of electricity in homes and businesses, thus reducing the county's carbon footprint.  The outcome of this research complements this local need.

The partnership aims to create a platform, which consists of novel optimization-control algorithms and hardware designs, to enable a diverse and smart demand response, and energy conservation applications ranging from households to utility power grids. The platform enables demand response programs that offer customer choices for efficient use of electricity at all levels. 

During the course of the project, the research team developed new optimization-based algorithms and a sensor/control hardware prototype for residential demand response (DR) applications. The optimization-based algorithms consist of two sets of algorithms. The first set of algorithm is a human expert-based approach to perform electrical peak demand management. This approach helps allocate demand curtailments (MW) among distribution substations (DSs) or feeders in an electric utility service area based on requirements of the central load dispatch center. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to model a complex decision-making process in this algorithm. The second set of algorithm developed is an intelligent Home Energy Management (HEM) algorithm for managing high power consumption household appliances, e.g., an electric water heater, an air conditioner, a clothes dryer and an electric vehicle. The hardware prototype designs include a smart power management system and wireless sensor-control devices that can control up to four 240-Volt power intensive loads at the same time. The prototype and its associated HEM algorithm provide an insight into the overall HEM system operation for automated residential DR applications.

The real-world implementation of the developed system is expected to benefit electric power distribution companies by helping them to avoid distribution transformer overloads with the presence of new power-intensive loads, like electric vehicles. Overall, the project has contributed novel algorithms and advanced technologies to realize the customer interface of the smart grid. In addition, from the project initiation in Sept 2011, this project has resulted in five (5) journal papers, and eight (8) conference papers published/accepted. One graduate student completed his M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in the summer of 2014. Two graduate students are expected to take their Ph.D. preliminary exams in the Fall 2014.

The project emphasizes two emerging technologies RNA interference--(RNAi) and nano-structured materials--to function in concert as an antiviral effector molecule and delivery system, respectively.  Infectious diseases caused by viral pathogens account for substantial mortality in farmed Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and result in devastating financial losses.  The aim of this project is to rapidly develop highly specific RNAi-based antiviral molecules to protect individual shrimp from emerging viral infections.  These antiviral molecules will be combined with a nanoparticle substrate so that the antiviral can be delivered orally to individual shrimp during the rearing process.   The goals and predicted outcomes of this project will result in a platform system that can be rapidly adapted to respond to ever-evolving and emerging infectious disease issues in shrimp farming.  Therefore, the project has strong potential for sustained innovation and to transform disease control for this industry. 

The broader impacts of this project, beyond those for the partners, are economic benefits to the U.S., including the following:  1) Stable or even lower consumer prices for a high protein seafood product supplied from an industry that would dramatically increase its supply, if vaccines were available; 2) benefit to U.S. companies that export wheat and soybeans-- the two main ingredients in shrimp feeds--along with U.S. feed companies that export high tech microencapsultated larval feeds to shrimp hatcheries worldwide; 2) producers of breeding stocks of shrimp, 3) sustainable and predictable harvests for domestic shrimp producers, and 4) positioning the U.S. as the leader in the aquaculture biotechnologies needed for shrimp/fish farmers to supply future increases in demand for seafood that the capture fisheries cannot meet. Broader impacts will also be witnessed through training junior scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels in a manner that will advance their capacity to practice science in an environment of entrepreneurialism--balancing bench work and scientific advancement with the demands and timelines of business.  Trainees will benefit from academics and professional development mentoring at the lead institution and from regular interactions and time with the employees and leadership at the associated knowledge-enhancement partner companies.

Farmed shrimp production and sales support an industry that is worth an estimated 9 billion dollars annually.  The U.S. is the primary importer of farmed shrimp; over 500,000 metric tons of shrimp are imported every year for U.S. consumers.  Infectious diseases, particular viral diseases, have a tremendous impact on the industry.  When disease hits a pond of growing shrimp, the grower is forced to prematurely harvest, or can result in complete loss of animals; billions of dollars of production loss are attributed to viral diseases.  Despite the economic importance of this industry, there are no veterinary interventions available to protect or cure shrimp of infections.  We proposed to develop an innovative and flexible approach to shrimp disease control using an antiviral coupled with a nanoparticle delivery system.  The concept for this award was to develop a nanoparticle substrate that associates with and delivers an antiviral molecule to the animals orally in the water. The antiviral molecules for this approach are double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) that function as a vaccine, enhancing the shrimp immune response to breakdown the target virus.  Specific goals outlined to meet the overarching goal are 1) to develop new antiviral molecules for the two most economically important viruses of shrimp, and 2) to optimize nanoparticle substrates for oral delivery of those antiviral molecules.   We envisioned a product that will be delivered to young juvenile shrimp, and a product that can be rapidly adapted to respond to ever-evolving and emerging infectious disease issues in shrimp farming; therefore this project has strong potential for sustained innovation in response to market demand.  Furthermore, approach we?ve taken to this work provides a platform for disease control in shrimp, but could readily be used in disease control for other aquaculture (e.g., finned fish) or agriculture (e.g., honeybees) species of interest. 

We realized tremendous success in the original goals and made significant advancements toward the developing products that control shrimp disease.  New and potent antiviral molecules were developed for both Infectious myonecrosis virus (IMNV) and White spot syndrome virus (WSSV).   Further, we showed that polyanhydride-based nanoparticles can get into, and disseminate through the tissues of shrimp.  Finally, we have shown that these particles deliver antiviral molecules to shrimp tissues and provide protection from disease caused by WSSV and IMNV.  In the process, broader impacts were realized in training a number of young scientists.  Five undergraduate students engaged in research efforts that have expanded their skillsets in animal handling, sterile techniques and molecular biology.  One graduate student focused her efforts on this project, earned her PhD at Iowa State University, and has 4 first author publications pending.  Four postdoctoral scholars engaged in this work and have had opportunity to present their research at national and international scientific meetings.  All of the postdoctoral researchers have authorship on pending publications.  Because of the Partnership for Innovation mechanism of funding, our academic lab at Iowa State University partnered with a local biotechnology company and benefited from interactions with shrimp industry partners; as a result, trainees had a unique opportunity to work toward the goals of the project and understand the drive to develop a product with profound potential economic benefit.   Two intellectual property disclosures have been filed with the PI and two of the trainees mentioned above, to describe the information generated in these projects; one of these is in the patent process.

Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have provided significant insight into how the nervous system receives, processes, and transmits information. With the ability to stimulate and record from cells within the nervous system using MEAs, neuroscientists have been able to probe neural circuitry and examine the underlying spatiotemporal dynamics in health and disease.  The overall goal of this partnership is to develop and productize a microelectrode array platform technology for neuroscience that is in turn capable of successively producing increasingly complex high performance devices.  The vision is a multifunctional MEA platform technology that incorporates: 1) multichannel optical stimulation, using embedded organic light emitting diodes for selective neurostimulation; 2) shape memory polymers to provide a more robust, long-lived interface with the nervous system; 3) embedded microsystems based on thin-film transistors and piezoelectric polymers for on-board signal processing and micro-positioning of electrodes in vivo; and 4) low-cost, disposable fabrication materials and methods for in vitro neuropharmacological assay use. The project team proposes to develop this novel multifunctional MEA platform technology by leveraging advances in flexible display technology and materials science, demonstrating this technology platform in both in vitro and in vivo neuroscience studies.  

The broader impacts of this research will include the resulting technologies that will be productized in various embodiments for use in clinical research and treatment.  Because the proposed MEA platform is based on materials and processes that have been developed for the flexible display industry, a clear path to large volume manufacturing has already been demonstrated.  In addition to the technology to be developed, which will open up whole new areas of research in neuroscience, the graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project will be exposed to a wide array of science and technology, ranging from semiconductor processing to neuroscience.  They will also learn a tremendous amount about systems engineering, because, while the bulk of the project is about microelectrode array development, the arrays have to be compatible with the recording and stimulating electronics and software.  Even more important, the students have the opportunity to work with proven entrepreneurs, such as Harvey Wiggins, the founder of Plexon.  Mr. Wiggins has taken Plexon from a one person operation to the leading manufacturer of neuroscience recording hardware and software in the world.  The students will be involved in the entire innovation process, including product definition, product design, process development, product fabrication and testing and finally marketing.  UT Dallas' High School Comets program will also get local high school students involved in the project.  The ultimate goal of the program is to create a technology platform that will create high paying jobs for students like those involved in this project, and, at the same time, benefit society by providing a new set of tools for neuroscientists to solve the most pressing medical problems.

This in vitro paradigm has served as a successful platform for a wide range of applications including neuropharmacology, assessing biocompatibility of novel materials and basic neural network plasticity.  Compared to other electrophysiological assays or imaging approaches, MEAs offer label-free, non-invasive, and long-term recording capabilities.  A major limitation has been the reliance on expensive recording substrates that have been manufactured with the intent of re-use. Unlike virtually all cell culture dishes and chambers, many of the available MEAs are expected to be re-used where specialized and experienced handling is required. In contrast, by leveraging flexible display fabrication approaches, the process for fabricating UT Dallas MEAs relies on materials common to biomedical applications, such as polycarbonate and parylene C, and can be readily scaled in a cost efficient manner. Based on flexible display fabrication costs, we estimate production costs at nominal volumes to be &lt;$3 per cm2 such that the novel MEA could be fabricated for &lt;$25. We have characterized the UT Dallas planar MEAs fabricated with low cost materials and processes.  We compared the performance of the UT Dallas MEAs, which consist of exposed gold microelectrodes with patterned parylene insulation over traces, with well-established commercially available MEAs using cultured murine cortical networks.  Detailed electrophysiological comparisons show virtually identical performance between MEA types with respect to network metrics including recording yield across the array, network spike rate and burst rate, and identical pharmacological response to neuropharmacological agents, pilocarpine and memantine.

Mitigation of the effects of the oil on the land and wildlife could be achieved if the deposition of the oil onto these substrates could be prevented. In this context, deposition of oil onto substrates is routinely achieved in laundry by the use of polymeric soil anti-redeposition agents. This RAPID project seeks to investigate the propensity of these agents to mitigate the effects of oil deposition on the Gulf Coast. The project will identify effective oil anti-deposition aids that are nontoxic, biodegradable and available commercially in amount large enough to mitigate the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on the Gulf Coastline. These agents are polymers that essentially sterically-stabilize the oil droplets and prevent close approach at which attractive London dispersion forces would operate. However, the Gulf is much larger than a laundry load, the oil in the Gulf is overwhelming the system, and the water is seawater rather than freshwater. These are significant unknown variables. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile exploring the use of oil anti-deposition agents for their possible effect in mitigating this disaster. The most commonly used soil anti-redeposition agents are cellulose ethers, which are available inexpensively in large commercial quantities. Carboxymethylcellulose ethers are listed on the EPA subinventory. These are not likely to accumulate in the food chain due to their water solubility and high molecular weight (bioconcentration potential is low). They are nontoxic to fish and aquatic organisms on an acute basis. They are expected to slowly biodegrade in the aquatic environment. These compounds are already released into the environment in vast quantities as a consequence of their widespread use in laundry detergents. There are also Marine proteins that are by-products of fisheries that will be investigated in the proposed research, for their ability to prevent oil from sticking to coastal substrates. The search for anti-deposition aids normally would be expected to require years of intensive effort. However, as a consequence of the high throughput laboratory and concomitant skill sets that has been built under the aegis of the Partnerships for Innovation program (PFI Award 0917730), the Principal Investigator has considerable knowledge of the science of consumer goods, such as laundry detergents, and he will lead the high throughput screening effort with state-of the art robotic liquid handlers and micro-channel emulsification devices. This study will also provide a basis for the real understanding of the role of adsorbing hydrophilic polymers on seawater substrates for the purposes of anti-deposition.

If successful, the knowledge gained will mitigate the effects of the current catastrophic oil spill and provide materials to tackle future similar disasters. The project will educate the scientific workforce on combinatorial experimentation methods, and in response to crises.",,,"NSF Rapid Project 1047662 was funded with the overall objective to mitigate the deposition of oil on solid coastal surfaces including soil, sand, plant and wild-life. The limitations of the proposed application require that the materials used must be well-known commodities and the technology should be either reduced to practice or show significant promise from its use in other applications.  We proposed to investigate the use of soil anti-redeposition agents, which are commercial products that are currently used in laundry to prevent deposition of oils on fabrics during rinsing when surfactant concentrations drop below the critical levels to keep the oil suspended.

This RAPID project proved the concept that it was possible to conceive of a dispersant for spilled oil having the properties:
 

The dispersant easily dispersed the oil with only minimal agitation.
Once dispersed, the oil did not adhere to bird feathers.The dispersant consisted of food-additive type materials that are abundantly available.In particular, the dispersant comprised lecithin and either hydroxypropylcellulose or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.
Successful formulations adsorbed viscoelastic layers that exhibited more solid-like than liquid-like characteristics.


We hypothesize that the lecithin acts as primary emulsifier and also chaperones the cellulose ether to the oil-water interface.


 The ?non-stick? properties are hypothesized to result from the sterically-stabilizing layer of hydrophilic polymer which is anchored to the oil droplet by the lecithin.
 The concept formulation appears to be cost-effective in comparison with current commercial dispersants. 


Outlook:

This project has now been funded by an NSF Accelerating Innovative Research grant (1127846) that has provided the funding to already successfully develop a working prototype which at the present time has been scaled to pilot scale.

Current low-volume electrode optimization processes, aimed at lowering the need for special chemicals (catalysts) and improving durability, are costly and slow, hindering the commercialization of these important technologies. If successful, the project will enable scaling up the production of a novel catalyst and will establish highly needed scientific understanding of the correlations between catalyst properties, electrode fabrication processes and performance. Therefore, this project is expected to provide clear guidance for the design of novel catalysts and electrodes. The multidisciplinary partnership between academic, industrial and National Renewable Energy Laboratory experts will work towards moving fuel cell and electrolyzers to the next level of high-scale production. Overall, the project is expected to enable the commercialization of clean energy technologies, benefit the environment and the US economy.

The proposed project aims to establish: 1) scale-up approaches to fabricate a novel, internally developed catalyst, with tunable properties and enhanced performance and durability, and 2) structure-property-process-performance (SPPP) correlations applicable to a wide range of catalysts/ink/electrode fabrication methods to enable fast transition to cost-effective scaled-up fabrication of fuel cell and electrolyzer electrodes, bringing these technologies closer to commercialization. Despite large investments and growing interest in these technologies, their commercialization is hindered by high cost and low durability of currently employed catalysts, and by slow and costly low-volume components fabrication. To address these challenges, the project will investigate a number of scalable ink/electrode fabrication approaches using advanced catalyst/ink/electrode characterization methods, providing a large parameter matrix for structure-property-process-performance correlations. The parameter matrix and established correlations will aid future catalyst/ and electrode design and enable fast transition from the current time-consuming and costly incremental low-scale process, to a streamlined and advanced scale-up approach. The anticipated technical results include: 1) delivery of 25g batches of novel catalyst produced at scale; 2) identification of SPPP correlations; 3) validation of team findings by industrial partner for effective technology transfer, and 4) dissemination of recommendations/protocols derived from the project to the community to promote deployment of future innovations.

Currently, a method called X-ray crystallographic analysis is the most important way to determine structure, but it is expensive to operate.  Two devices will be developed - one, to make small vessels to test many types of drug chemistries simultaneously, and another for better studies of the structure. Compared to current technologies, the microfluidic devices will perform better and be easier to operate, at a reduced cost.

The proposed project will lead to commercialization of two microfluidic devices. The first, intended for the high-throughput screening of protein crystallization conditions, will be developed with the following features: (a) ability to screen 400 different conditions per square centimeter using counter-diffusion, (b) no cross-contamination, (c) consumes less than 10 nanoliters protein per condition, (d) low cost to manufacture and operate, and (e) improved performance over existing technologies. The technical innovation of this device is to use passive capillary valves operating with minimal external control to sequence fluid flow and create isolated storage compartments. A second device will be developed to produce crystals optimized for X-ray diffraction using a novel feedback mechanism to separate protein crystal nucleation from growth. The device will be manufactured from a low molecular weight thermoplastic, allowing on-chip serial diffraction from hundreds of identical crystals thereby avoiding expensive and time consuming cryoprotection.

Of the 2.4 million eye injuries yearly in the US, 600,000 are open globe corneal tears, leading to blindness in 50,000 cases. There are 18 million cases of such blindness worldwide. The annual corneal grafting market is 40,000 procedures nationally and an estimated 185,000 worldwide. The proposed product is expected to circumvent the limitations of current surgical approaches and postoperative cost and care in corneal repair. This would result in cost savings for the entire ecosystem, such as patients, insurance companies (including Medicare), and hospitals.  The commercialization potential in the US and world markets can potentially generate job opportunities in research and development, marketing, and manufacturing.  Additional technical teaching and outreach opportunities involving students from underrepresented backgrounds, women, minorities, and people with disabilities are targeted with this project work. 

The proposed project presents a biocompatible and antimicrobial bioadhesive for corneal repair and grafting. Current standards of care include suturing and cyanoacrylate glue, which suffers from additional treatment costs related to astigmatism, secondary infections, cytotoxicity, and retinopathy. The proposed product is expected to mitigate these secondary problems with its biocompatibility, high adhesion, flexibility, and high strength. The adhesive will rapidly integrate corneal cells to facilitate wound sealing, reducing the chances of secondary infection and the associated incremental hospitalization and medication costs.  The material transparency will enable rapid vision restoration. The material is strongly adhesive and antimicrobial, preventing accidental removal and offering excellent stability and high retention. The goals of this project will be accomplished with three main tasks. In the first task, the team will systematically explore the effect of experimental conditions on bioadhesive characteristics, such as tissue adhesion, biocompatibility, flexibility, transparency, and antibacterial properties. In the second task, degradation and retention of the bioadhesive will be determined by investigating the changes when applied to corneal tears. In the third task, the integrative capacity of the bioadhesive in vivo will be assessed by studying its effects on corneal cells, as well as the migration of corneal cells into the bioadhesive over time.

Every year approximately 1.7 million Americans get infected in medical institutions and an estimated 100,000 of them die from complications caused by HAI. Nationally, it causes $35-45 billion financial burden for medical institutions, with implications for insurance companies.  In general, infections spread: a) between hospitals and the neighborhood, and b) between patients' rooms within the same hospital. The room-to-room infections are transferred by medical personnel and by mobile medical devices (scales, bladder scanners, stethoscopes, etc). We will develop a disinfection unit for mobile/portable medical devices that could potentially reduce the HAI rate by ~5%, saving roughly 5,000 American lives annually.  The average annual savings for a hospital implementing our disinfection unit is an estimated $300,000.  

The proposed project describes development of a foldable disinfection station for sterilization of mobile/portable medical devices.  The proliferation of microbes resistant to chemical disinfectant makes the use of high energy ultraviolet light for disinfection very promising; microbes do not develop resistance to deep ultraviolet (DUV) light because it operates at the level of DNA. High-touch surfaces, such as bladder scanners, scales, stethoscopes, touch screens, etc. are prone for contamination with microbes and thus need to be thoroughly disinfected before next use. Current disinfection procedures for mobile equipment rely on wiping them with chemicals but sometimes it is not a good option because: a) liquid disinfectant can short electrical circuits (USB, video, and sensor ports) and b) it is time-consuming to wipe multiple surfaces of instruments. We will engineer a foldable, easily deployable enclosure with a DUV light source as a low-labor, highly effective sterilization unit.

However, existing hardware cannot sustain the rapid growth of data-centric computing.  In particular, fast and energy-efficient AI requires better embedded memory technologies (i.e. data storage devices inside computer chips) that are simultaneously fast to read and write, while delivering high capacities with low cost, along with low power consumption. This project will address this challenge by developing a novel type of on-chip magnetic memory device, focusing on its commercialization in the data storage, AI, communications and networking markets.

MRAM is the leading contender for emerging AI systems due to its low power consumption and high endurance, and is entering volume manufacturing across the semiconductor industry after more than a decade of research and development.  However, its current version suffers from density and speed limitations that limit its ultimate addressable market. This project will develop devices and memory arrays based on new physical principles and materials, which will allow the devices to overcome the physical limitations of existing MRAM, and achieve higher speeds with better scalability to smaller bit dimensions.

This program will address the key bottlenecks in catalyst design and manufacturing to increase their efficiency and durability, while reducing their cost. A broad spectrum of high-tech industries could potentially benefit from commercialization of this technology, including automotive industry, consumer electronics, and fuel cell and battery manufacturers. The proposed technology can potentially have a direct impact on high-tech manufacturing in the United States, paving the way for clean-energy technology ventures and possibly leading to multiple start-up companies.

The existing technology used to reduce pollution, a catalytic converter, contains expensive, rare metals and does not perform well when an engine starts. An aerogel is a special lightweight material with many features that make it an attractive addition to a catalytic converter.  Aerogel-based catalytic converters would provide an economically attractive and sustainable approach to reducing automotive pollution, and thereby have a significant positive economic and environmental impact on the nation.  This project will develop new aerogels to achieve these goals.  In addition, the project will develop a research/entrepreneurship practicum to engage students (including those from traditionally underrepresented groups) in developing entrepreneurial ideas and learning about bringing technology developed through fundamental research to the marketplace. This new model for the undergraduate curriculum will provide students with substantial entrepreneurial experience at precisely the point at which such training could have maximal impact: prior to entering graduate school or the STEM workforce.

The proposed project will develop and test new aerogel catalysts to be used in the development of a superior technology for reducing automotive pollution. One of the primary technical challenges of the current technology, the catalytic converter, is its inability to minimize or eliminate emissions under cold-start conditions. Aerogels offer many features (high temperature stability, large surface area, low mass and tunable chemistry) that make them viable candidates for an alternative technology and they have been shown to be active in reducing exhaust pollution. By tuning their chemistry, aerogels can be made catalytically active and are effective at promoting conversion of exhaust gas pollutants. The proposed project will address several technical challenges associated with developing this potentially transformative alternative technology to reduce cold-start emissions by: (1) developing catalytically active aerogels with alternate chemistries to improve activation characteristics; (2) demonstrating the high-temperature survivability of these materials (3) investigating the potential of the catalytically active aerogels for lowering thermal inertia; (4) incorporating aerogels into conventional washcoating methods; (5) integrating aerogels into a prototype catalytic converter; and (6) developing transferable models of broad-based training and leadership development in innovation and entrepreneurship for undergraduate STEM students.

The broader impacts include benefits to the society, academic-industry collaboration, and entrepreneurship training to students.  FOGs are the number one cause of sewer pipe blockage worldwide and are usually landfilled as a nonhazardous waste. The cleanup is costly and the cost of landfill is also increasing.  An estimated 1 million tons of FOG from WWTPs is currently being landfilled at a cost of $50-100 million per year. Therefore, FOG reuse is critical to municipalities worldwide, which can also recover useful resources and lower carbon footprints of municipalities. This project will promote the adaptation of this environmentally friendly technology to reduce landfill waste disposal and sustainable energy generation. Landfill diversion is a need in most communities, and repurposed energy/materials will promote resource conservation.  This project will develop the knowledge and experience of the graduate student leader and four undergraduate students in the area of technology commercialization. This project will encourage participation of underrepresented groups. 

The proposed project will scale up the FOG separation process by demonstrating performance of a pilot system, which is a significantly stride to commercialization.  The resulting performance data will be then used to design and construct a commercial size system.  The objectives of this demonstration are to (1) establish the variability in composition of WWTP grease over time, (2) to produce sufficient separated yellow grease to test for usability in the production of biofuel, and (3) determine if byproduct solids and water can be reused as solid fuel/digester gas  and industrial water.   The intellectual merit of this technology is that the solvent-free extraction approach can overcome the challenges of FOG emulsion, impurities and high moisture content of the sewer grease, and can result in a low sulfur product that can be sold to downstream biofuel producers for biodiesel production. Other by-products derived from the process, such as water and solids, can also be marketable and offset the process cost. This process is low cost and environmentally friendly. This applied research can reduce start-up risk and facilitate subsequent commercialization.

However, currently available products in the market only offer separate solutions for solar energy generation and storage. They normally consist of a simple addition of a solar cell to a storage device with required wiring and power control systems; therefore, they are not only expensive and bulky, but also missing opportunities to increase performance by being integrated. This portable rechargeable solar battery technology is important since it integrates solar power and electricity storage in a single device and fully eliminates batteries. The proposed technology, if successful, will provide a cost-effective solar energy storage solution, where solar energy will be directly stored in the form of chemical energy without the unnecessary intermediate step such as conversion to electricity. This project can also create greater value to participants (postdocs, graduate students working on this project) and generate a pipeline of well-trained workforce with enhanced practice in the development of entrepreneurship and leadership. 

The proposed project introduces a new design principle for solar energy conversion using redox couples and visible-light-sensitive materials to directly convert and store solar energy into chemical energy at the liquid junction interface. This proposed technology centers on dual-function redox couples as both charge transfer materials and energy storage media in a portable rechargeable solar cell, which simultaneously generates and stores electricity under light illumination, and discharges when needed. In this project, the automatic photocharge and discharge that are regulated by the energetics at the liquid junction interface will be investigated and utilized as a unique controller-free and switch-free feature which is ideal for portable devices.

Examples of how this could be useful include a nature-inspired process for preparing freeze-dried cells so they can be stored at room temperature and rehydrated on demand, which would be useful for both research (cell lines) and medical treatments (red blood cells).

Current methods are not ideal for numerous reasons including low transfection efficiency and toxicity. We plan to develop devices that can be used for the following applications: (1) intracellular delivery of cryoprotectant molecules (such as trehalose) to red blood cells or to cultured cell lines so that cells can be frozen, dehydrated, stored at ambient temperature, and then rehydrated without substantial loss of viability or function; and (2) intracellular delivery of biomolecules (DNA, RNA, or protein) to cultured cells or primary cells for use in research or therapy. Parameters to be optimized include microfluidic designs, flow rate, cryopreservation or transfection solutions, and methods for sonoporating, freezing, drying, and recovery.

Stroke is the leading cause of neurological disability in the United States with approximately 795,000 people suffering a stroke each year. Arm paresis is a primary cause of disability because of the limitations it creates in performing activities of daily living (ADL). Approximately 80% of all stroke survivors suffer from upper limb paresis and only 18% of these individuals gain full motor recovery with conventional treatments in the year following stroke. Thus, rehabilitation of the impaired limb is essential for improving ADLs and quality of life after stroke, yet only 31% of stroke survivors receive outpatient rehabilitation. Brain-controlled robotic devices are excellent candidates for engaging the patients and delivering the repetitive and intensive practice stroke survivors require for rehabilitation. Our innovative robotic rehabilitation solution will offer increased efficiency, lower expenses, and new sensing capabilities to the therapist while reducing the socioeconomic burden of disability. 

The proposed project addresses a pressing need for accessible, safe and effective stroke rehabilitation devices for in-clinic and at-home use for sustainable long-term therapy, a global market size expected to reach $31B by 2021. Unfortunately, current devices fail to engage the patients, are hard to match to their needs, are costly to use and maintain, or are limited to clinical settings. Our patient-in-the-loop system solution consists of our patented noninvasive brain-robot technology that translates the user's brain activity into motor commands to drive powered, assist-as-needed, upper-limb robotics for stroke rehabilitation. Feedback of performance will be provided to both the patient and the clinician, and stored for monitoring and diagnostics, through a user interface that also serves to provide engaging real-time feedback of task and associated completion performance. System validation will occur in a clinical setting and at home. The Intellectual Merits include addressing the challenges of fault-tolerant system integration, low-cost device prototyping, usability, shared-control, acquiring validation data, and accelerating the translation to the patient for a new class of biomedical devices. The deliverable is an accessible, safe and effective brain-controlled therapeutical robot system that is multi-functional with real-time self-monitoring, self-diagnostics and self-correcting capabilities, and that promotes neurorecovery of function.

The market opportunity is tremendous as there are various large transportation hubs in the United States. The solution can also be extended to indoor navigation of other public facilities, such as school buildings, libraries, office buildings, and airports. The project will lead to three important outcomes: live facility models for facility management by transportation agencies, free indoor positioning and navigation apps for end users, and a rich set of multimodal transportation data and tools for researchers and developers. The societal need is significant, especially impactful for people in great need, such as those with visual impairments and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and those with challenges in finding places, particularly persons unfamiliar with metropolitan areas. In the U.S. alone, 6.6 million people have visual impairments, and 1 in 45 people have been diagnosed with ASD. The SAT-Hub will be an exemplar case to extend the reach of their mobility, give them more freedom, allow them to enhance the richness and quality of their lives, and improve their employment opportunities. 

The proposed project integrates an existing surveillance camera system, installed Bluetooth beacons, and a building information model of a transportation or other public facility, with a hybrid solution of a mobile phone localization app (using beacons, on-board sensors, and cameras along with 3D sensors). These will be incorporated with personalized user interfaces to provide a seamless service to the end users, while also providing valuable user information and facility use information to transportation infrastructure stakeholders.  Our solution is a system-engineering approach to a challenging problem in urban transportation that integrates three major components: multilayer live facility modeling tools, hybrid mobile navigation algorithms, and multimodal human-centric interface designs. The technology innovation lies in the integration of smart infrastructure (civil engineering) with accessible services (sensing and computing). The key technological challenges come from two sides: the seamless integration of the system with the main operations of a transportation or other facility base on obtaining information and data (such as surveillance data and 3D model data), and the optimization and personalization of user interfaces to address various user needs.

Janus colloids for consumer products are not commercially available, in part, due to the lack of a scale technology that can i) drive the required translational research needed for fundamental insight and development and ii) be scaled to meet potential industry demand.  The technology presented in this proposal overcomes these major bottlenecks towards the commercialization of Janus colloids that could lead to job growth, as the patents developed from this proposal will be licensed to a newly developed enterprise. Furthermore, fundamental insights into polymer-polymer phase behavior at the nanoscale and structure-property relationships of Janus colloids will be a natural outcome of addressing the bottlenecks towards commercialization. The proposal will facilitate an extensive education and outreach program with one aim of expanding access to science and technology and encouraging entrepreneurship as a career path.

The proposed project addresses fundamental knowledge gaps which require understanding prior to the scale up of Flash NanoPrecipitation for the production and first-to-market commercialization of Janus colloids in consumer products.  The study provides fundamental insights into how combining colloid formation using rapid micro-mixing and kinetically arrested precipitation with polymer phase separation at the nanoscale can lead to the production of Janus colloids. Commercialization requires connecting processing parameters of Flash NanoPrecipitation with the molecular parameters of the polymers from which the Janus colloids are assembled: process-structure relationship studies. The second-level of structure and property relationship is the connection between the geometry and properties of Janus colloids, as amphiphiles to the desired properties for formulations in personal- and health-care products.  In particular, this proposal aims to develop the rules of biocompatible Janus colloid production by understanding how polymer-polymer interactions, interfacial properties, and molecular characteristics, e.g., molecular weight and glass transition, influence the structure of Janus colloids.  Structure will be evaluated using state-of-the art three-dimensional microscopy tools.  Furthermore, the work aims to reveal how Janus colloids stabilize emulsions and foams with respect to different formulations and process parameters including stability against centrifugal fields, temperature and polarity which will lead to enhanced formulation properties.

The proposed technology will allow customers to effectively and reliably control process-induced defects during production, reducing rates of part rejection or rework, production costs, and cycle times, while increasing manufacturing efficiency and robustness. Moreover, the materials manufactured with the proposed technology will provide a viable solution for in-field repair of composites, replacing problematic legacy methods and disrupting an area poised for growth. Educationally, the project will provide opportunities to train participants in technology advancement and commercialization, and will foster cooperation between academic and industry participants. Scientifically, the project will contribute to a deeper and broader understanding of engineering science and technology associated with composite materials and production processes. Societally, the project will increase U.S. technical competitiveness in composites, advanced materials, and advanced manufacturing across multiple sectors of national interest, create jobs, and contribute to economic growth and long-term prosperity.

The proposed project will develop material and process technologies that address long-standing efficiency and robustness challenges associated with manufacturing of composite structures. Many sectors, including aerospace, seek to utilize low-pressure out-of-autoclave (OoA) processing to improve production rates and reduce costs. However, commercial OoA prepreg materials (fibers impregnated with liquid resin) possess a sub-optimal design that results in unacceptable defects in non-ideal manufacturing conditions. This project will develop methods for producing advanced prepregs with an optimized format by combining partial impregnation and a discontinuous resin distribution. The project team will (1) develop industrially-scalable production methods, (2) create prototype materials for two applications with strong market needs (aerospace structure fabrication, and in-field repair), and (3) perform scale-up trials in realistic conditions for validation and demonstration. These activities require knowledge, use, and control of complex physical processes, including deformation of multi-scale fiber beds, multi-phase fluid flow, and microstructural defect formation. Technical work will advance knowledge in advanced manufacturing, materials science, and composites processing, and lead to viable methods for producing innovative prepregs. Overall, the project will derive intellectual merit from leveraging and applying fundamental insights, developing new science-based materials and systems, and providing a technical basis for further advancement.

In the recent years, wind hazards have caused significant building repair costs, placing tremendous burden on their owners and insurance companies. To reduce the vulnerability of buildings to extreme wind events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, a holistic platform is required to (1) estimate the risk of failure of a building under the expected intensity and frequency of occurrence of windstorms in a given region; and (2) inform the involved entities, including design consultants, contractors, stakeholders, and insurance companies, on how to avoid the risk of failure through innovative design and mitigation strategies. While the former aspect has been studied to some extent by the involved agencies and companies, the latter aspect has remained largely unexplored, due to technical complexities, budget constraints, and the absence of supporting guides and tools. This has motivated the development of the very first wind performance-based risk assessment and mitigation tool.


The proposed project will result in a multi-purpose tool to transform the analysis and design of buildings subjected to wind hazards. This is a unique innovation, as it employs, for the first time, the concepts of risk assessment and mitigation together to maximize the safety and performance of buildings in high-wind areas. For assessment purposes, this tool relies on a performance-based philosophy, which offers versatile capabilities to optimize the design in such a way that the cost is minimized, while the target performance objectives are achieved. On the other hand, for mitigation purposes, a decision-making algorithm is implemented to consider multiple strategies and identify the best solution based on a range of performance, cost, and risk metrics. This will be an important step forward to address the challenges that have prevented the building sector from ensuring the safety and comfort of buildings against wind loads. The innovation of the proposed tool, however, will not be limited to its simulation capabilities, data-driven algorithms, and predictive models, as it will deliver a platform that greatly facilitates the communication and collaboration among various entities involved in the finance, design, maintenance, and insurance of buildings.

The same technology can serve other applications where large DC loads are present, including the data centers, which already make up 1.8% of total US power consumption. 


The proposed project will advance technologies developed under the FREEDM ERC, by solving a number of important challenges in the area of medium voltage power conversion. We will prove that our recently discovered, provisional patent protected, single stage power converter can reduce system costs and improve system efficiency. The team will analytically derive the conditions that allow for switching device soft-switching transitions that result in minimal system losses. We will develop analytical models to determine the optimal switching trajectories that consider phase shift, switching frequency and non-linear saturable inductor elements as independent variables. With an analytical representation of the optimal modulation schemes for the proposed controller, the team will develop a design space exploration tool to systematically trade off converter design parameters against multiple performance criteria, namely cost, efficiency, power density and reliability.

IVF is currently the most effective treatment for infertility, but success rates for IVF remain low, with only ~30% of cycles resulting in live birth which, in turn, leads to high financial and emotional costs. Improving the success rate of IVF would help IVF patients and the approximately 10% of couples who suffer from infertility, and would lead to broad societal and economic benefit. The proposed work makes use of advanced imaging and computational image analysis, and has a tight integration between biology, physics, engineering, clinical medicine, and commercialization. Undergraduate, graduate students, and postdocs, will benefit from this interdisciplinary environment and training. This effort will help increase the involvement of women and underrepresented minorities in science, innovation, and technological commercialization.


The proposed project tests and develops the use of metabolic imaging as a means to non-invasively measure oocyte quality. Metabolic imaging of oocytes holds great promise for improving IVF success rates: the current inability to determine oocyte quality is one of the major impediments to better IVF treatment, and oocyte quality is believed to be determined by oocyte metabolism. Previous and preliminary data demonstrated that metabolic imaging does not harm mouse oocytes and that it can be used to measure biologically meaningful metabolic differences between different mouse oocytes. The proposed project will expand on that work to investigate the safety and utility of the technology on in vitro matured human oocytes (clinically useless, otherwise discarded material). It is necessary to perform such safety tests before attempting to use metabolic imaging in a clinical setting. This work will also provide information on the metabolism of human oocytes, which is of fundamental import, with broad application for development, infertility, and birth defects. Furthermore, a clinical instrument must be robust and integrate into the clinical workflow. A key challenge is image and data analysis. Thus, this project also seeks to develop and validate fully automated image and data analysis procedures.

One of the most significant reason for these low success rates are limitations to current approaches for selecting high quality oocytes and corresponding embryos for transfer. The current standard method is a morphological examination with conventional transmitted light microscopy. Prior studies have demonstrated that mitochondria are crucial for oocytes and embryos, and defects in mitochondrial metabolism are associated with a reduction in viability. The present project sought to further the development of metabolic imaging, via two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, as a quantitative, non-invasive approach to improve clinical IVF treatment. The work furthered the improvement of the technology regarding safety, reproducibility, and usability. During this project, students and postdocs were trained in interdisciplinary work that entailed a tight integration between biology, physics, engineering, clinical medicine, and commercialization. The completed work advanced the commercialize effort, with the ultimate goal of bringing novel technology to clinic to aid IVF patients and the 10% of couples who suffer from infertility.

Cortisol is a biomarker used for stress evaluation in human subjects. Increased cortisol levels have been linked to stress-related diseases, including chronic fatigue syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Therefore accurate measurement of cortisol in saliva, and sweat, is gaining increasing clinical significance to predict multiple physical and mental diseases. While existing laboratory techniques, such as ELISA and FIA, can provide precise cortisol measurements, they are generally too slow, where a rapid response or intervention is needed. The proposed technology overcomes significant limitations such as the necessity of having specified sample volume to perform a test, total testing time, and expensive optical detection unit. The substantial advantage of the proposed technology is to produce cortisol results within few minutes and can replace tedious laboratory-based techniques. This technology will create personalized behavioral intervention to regulate cortisol levels and prevent stress-related health problems for at-risk clinical populations. The proposed cortisol sensing technology will provide solutions to hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, and pharmaceutical industries, which increasingly rely on fast, sensitive, reproducible and fully automated technologies.


The proposed project aims to translate a sensor technology, developed under a previously funded NSF grant, into a low-cost, handheld sensing device to monitor the salivary cortisol levels in point-of-care (POC) monitoring. The FIU team has engineered recognition site of cortisol sensor using antibody- mimic, robust and easily industrially scalable electroactive imprinted polymers that allow to miniaturize device in easily deployable and portable format. In order to translate the sensor into the market, the project will be consolidated into two goals: (i) sensor stability and measurement repeatability, and (ii) reducing cost and size. To accomplish these goals FIU team will 1) develop of high-affinity and reagent-less MIP sensor for Cortisol using novel electroactive monomers and 2) Constructing a low-cost handheld/portable prototype for field use. The proposed cortisol sensor will be capable of sending real-time data from the sensor to the virtual server via a smartphone app. The real-time data will be populated and processed on the virtual machines and will be archived by the user on their personal computer or smartphone app. The project will fortify a cross-university collaboration between the areas of health science and engineering; resulting in interdisciplinary biomedical research training for students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty.

Machinery malfunctions have significant negative effects on the manufacturing industry, including: unscheduled downtime leading to the under-utilization of equipment and staff; the production of off-spec products leading to waste of finished product and raw materials; as well as costly-repairs and inefficient maintenance schedules. All these effects increase the cost of manufacturing and can result in loss of revenue, directly affecting the margin of profitability, and thus the competitiveness, for these companies. By improving machine condition monitoring and enabling the widespread adoption of predictive maintenance, we believe our solutions can contribute to the growth of the US manufacturing sector, with all the significant ancillary benefits that entails. Better prediction of machine failures could also potentially affect energy efficiency, environmental impact and workplace safety in manufacturing operations. 


The proposed project will develop an integrated, Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) solution to continuous condition monitoring of manufacturing machinery. Our solution is centered around a network of low-cost, high quality, remote acoustic sensing devices with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) for sound recognition, that can automatically detect and diagnose the early signs of machine failure. Our novel focus on acoustic emissions, both in the audible and ultrasonic range, means that our sensors are non-contact and thus easy to install, capable of monitoring multiple parts per sensor, and able to produce earlier warnings than those possible with existing solutions. Furthermore, our use of AI for sound recognition results in fast and scalable analytics in real-time with minimal expertise required. We provide a unified cyber-infrastructure integrating edge computing, cloud data storage and an easy-to-use dashboard to facilitate navigation, retrieval and operation. This combination has the potential to result in a disruptive and transformative product that improves machine condition monitoring while significantly lowering the cost of deployment and operation.

This Partnership for Innovation Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) collaborative project tackles the impending threats to humanity of illiteracy and faltering education heads-on by creating a new smart-service human-computer interface (HCI) neurotechnology platform as a highly effective, user-friendly, and fun-to-use tool aiding learning and stimulating cognitive development at home and in the classroom.  The immersive HCI neurotechnology will allow directly measuring progress at the cognitive level and providing real-time feedback to guide the user in learning to read more effectively.  The project is highly Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) intensive both in its activities and in the targeted benefits of the developed technology, which extends directly to learning science and mathematics by probing cognitive performance of children while they solve puzzles.  The development of unobtrusive neurotechnology further addresses a critical need for practical integrated and modular brain-computer interface (BCI) solutions in HCI promoting widespread consumer and clinical use in the marketplace.  The partnership provides opportunities for students to gain practical experience in innovation in the marketplace through internships with the industrial partners.

The central aim is to develop and leverage new HCI technology as a learning coach and personal cognitive development assistant that facilitates learning to read and acquiring other critical skills in cognitive development.  The immersive yet unobtrusive HCI technology testbed will comprise a dry-electrode electroencephalography (EEG) BCI, a tablet with touchscreen and integrated camera, and a suite of signal processing algorithms running in the cloud, for monitoring brain and gaze activity in children learning to read, and providing real-time neurofeedback on progress in cognitive performance to promote enhanced learning.  The partnership will transition scientific advances of a previous NSF-sponsored UCSD project (NSF EFRI-M3C, ENG-1137279) in studying the distributed dynamics of human motor control, to development of neurofeedback training paradigms for learning enhancement, and to practical deployment on the unobtrusive immersive testbed implemented using Cognionics dry-electrode EEG wireless BCI neurotechnology and Syntrogi real-time cloud-based signal processing software pipelines.  The potential for human empowerment by the technology will be demonstrated by evaluating effectiveness in enhancing learning capabilities and cognitive performance in simulated classroom settings and other targeted learning environments.

Low cost, high performance portable neutron detectors will have applications ranging from homeland security to medical treatment.  First responders will be able to continuously monitor for the presence of special nuclear materials, providing a distributed, networked array of detectors covering the entire country, making it nearly impossible to move special nuclear materials without being detected.  Medical physicists will be able to monitor the production of neutrons during heavy ion cancer treatment to collect data on the long term impact of secondary neutrons. 

The technology is based on research that resulted in detectors that have shown >13% intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency. Currently, most portable neutron detectors are based on 3He-filled tubes.  While these detectors have been the workhorse of the nuclear industry for many years, they require high voltage and they are fragile, bulky, and too expensive to be widely distributed.  There is a need for high efficiency neutron detectors that are rugged, low cost, low power and that can be networked together. This PFI program involves the University of Texas at Dallas working closely with Texas Instruments to develop the electronics to tile many small solid state neutron detectors together into an array that will provide performance similar to commercially available 3He detectors at a greatly reduced cost.
 
This project addresses several technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery?toward commercial application. For example, this program will couple highly efficient neutron detector elements with high performance signal processing electronics made from state-of-the-art silicon CMOS, based on an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) that has at least 25 channels of pre-amplification and pulse shaping circuitry, with one channel coupled to each 1 cm2 detector element. This will allow the demonstration of a 25 cm2 solid state neutron detector array with performance equivalent to a conventional 3He detector.  Simulations show that the high performance, low noise electronics should enable 20% intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency.  Because all of the electronics are combined in one ASIC, the cost of the electronics can be reduced from approximately $1200 using discreet components for each channel, to <$10 for the entire array.  Because of the greatly reduced cost, portable neutron detectors would be available for applications never before possible. This project will support two graduate students who will be trained in the area of radiation detectors and nuclear electronics.  This is quickly becoming a lost skill set and there is a need for the next generation of engineers and scientists that understand radiation detectors and the associated electronics.  The students will also have the opportunity to work with engineers and scientists at Texas Instruments, the leader in the field of analog and mixed signal electronics.  This is an opportunity to which few students have access.",,,"The team continue to develop with Texas Instruments INC a rugged, efficient and portable system for thermal neutron detection to allow the deployment of a large number of networked detectors for every law enforcement and first responder professional in charge of public safety. The low-cost and the compatibility of this system with smartphones make it suitable to be used as an add-on, making the charged particle and radiation detection available not only for Homeland Security, but also as an indispensable tool to monitor nuclear plants, laboratories and every place handling radioactive materials. If successful, this system will replace current He-3 tube technologies that are the standard in commercial neutron detection systems.  

Two students continue to be heavily engaged with Texas Instruments in the circuit design. We have identified anew scheme for signal amplification that heavily reduce constrains for diode integration. Furthermore, the cost is reduced by 10X. The system cost is now calculated to be around &lt; 25 dollars / cm2 of detection area. These costs are for prototype development and with scaled manufacturing the cost is expected to be reduced substantially.   

We have also demonstrated a new way to fabricate 3D Si-diodes and a new way to fill the diodes with 10-boron for increased efficiency demonstrated. We have demonstrated diode efficiencies of ~ 13% for nominal simulated efficiency of 15%.

The SWEET-AC concept is important because it will deliver an energy efficient and environmentally friendly cooling technology. Continuous increases in median global temperatures, hikes in energy prices, widespread water shortages, and climate change issues all will lead to a demand for higher energy efficiency products. Compared to conventional vapor compressor-based air conditioners, the SWEET-ACs will have an enhanced cooling efficiency while producing a minimal carbon footprint in order to meet market demands and societal needs. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery?toward commercial application. Conventional vapor compression air-conditioning systems consume a large amount of electrical energy and have a detrimental impact on the environment. Direct and indirect evaporative cooling technologies can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the conventional ACs. However, current evaporative coolers are far from reaching their potential in energy efficiency and the hurdle is the lack of optimized heat exchangers. This project will directly address this key issue by developing a scalable and high performance heat exchanger material for evaporative coolers. In contrast to conventional evaporation materials, the proposed superwicking surfaces do not require water pump to constantly wet the heat exchangers. They will have a water contact angle of < 5 degrees, a surface saturation of 90%, a minimum wicking speed of 1 cm/sec, and a minimum unit area cooling power of 0.2 W/cm2 for an air velocity of 4 m/sec at 40 C.  In addition, this AIR: TT project will train graduate and undergraduate students, and postdoctoral researchers with commercialization and entrepreneurship skills in additional to their research. 

The project will engage air conditioner companies to?guide the team in industrial requirements and commercialization aspects?in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.","Garcell, E and Guo, C.~Polarization-Controlled Microchannel Arrays Induced by Femtosecond Laser Pulses~Journal of applied physics~123~2018~~~~10060357~213103~10060357~OSTI~14/06/2018 09:01:47.666000000, Yong, Jiale and Singh, Subhash C. and Zhan, Zhibing and Chen, Feng and Guo, Chunlei~How To Obtain Six Different Superwettabilities on a Same Microstructured Pattern: Relationship between Various Superwettabilities in Different Solid/Liquid/Gas Systems~Langmuir~35~2019~~~10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b03726~10084714~921 to 927~10084714~OSTI~01/02/2019 21:01:45.430000000, Zhan, Zhibing and Li, Zihao and Yu, Zhi and Singh, Subhash and Guo, Chunlei~Superhydrophobic Al Surfaces with Properties of Anticorrosion and Reparability~ACS Omega~3~2018~~~10.1021/acsomega.8b02631~10084717~p. 17425-17429~10081608~OSTI~01/02/2019 21:01:45.543000000, Singh, Subhash C. and Li, Huiyan and Yao, Chaonan and Zhan, Z. and Yu, Weili and Yu, Zhi and Guo, Chunlei~Structural and compositional control in copper selenide nanocrystals for light-induced self-repairable electrodes~Nano Energy~51~2018~~~10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.07.020~10084716~774 to 785~10084716~OSTI~01/02/2019 21:01:46.296000000, Garcell, Erik M. and Lam, Billy and Guo, Chunlei~Femtosecond laser-induced herringbone patterns~Applied Physics A~124~2018~~~10.1007/s00339-018-1822-z~10060358~ ~10060358~OSTI~14/06/2018 09:01:47.363000000, Garcell, Erik M. and Guo, Chunlei~Polarization-controlled microgroove arrays induced by femtosecond laser pulses~Journal of Applied Physics~123~2018~~~10.1063/1.5028197~10060359~213103~10060359~OSTI~14/06/2018 09:01:47.333000000",,"This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project was focused on translating on research discoveries of laser-produced superwicking/superhydrophilic surfaces to large-scale production of heat exchangers, the most critical component in evaporative coolers and subsequently to create a new class of Super-Wicking Efficient Evaporative Technology based Air Conditioners (SWEET-ACs).  We used we used superwicking Al and superwicking polymer for the fabrication of an energy efficient, pump-less, and compressor less space cooling solutions to reduced grid electricity consumption and carbon emission. Coolers developed under this project consumes 8-10 operates only on a fan but delivers cooling power similar to a compressor-based air conditioner, thus saves about 7-10 time lower electrical energy.  The outcome of this project will deliver energy efficient and environmental friendly cooling technology at an unprecedented lower cost to make a comfortable life for the citizens of all communities. The developed cooling solution will be a gift not only for the poor country but it will also provide a smart device for developed countries to cut their promised carbon emissions. The continuous increase in the global average temperature, hikes in the energy prices, water crisis and climate change issues all provide our proposed SWEET-ACs a strong market, large demands, and urgent societal need for energy efficient, environmentally friendly, and low water consuming cooling systems. Under this project, we used our superwicking heat exchangers for the fabrication of direct, indirect, and indirect-direct evaporative coolers. Developed coolers operate at low electrical energy, consume less water, and can operate on water and saline water, thus solves energy, water and environmental issues. Since superwicking materials get dried quickly, when it is not in contact with water, therefore avoids biofouling and reduce maintenance cost.

The sensor technology is important because it will have a broad impact to human health in terms of providing a method for the general population to measure air-contamination indicator volatile organic compounds (VOCs) levels and associated risks at home and in the environment.  This project provides a large-scale and green route toward the low-cost synthesis of nanoparticles as printable nanomaterials that are used for manufacturing the sensors.  It provides the advantage of lower cost manufacturing of the sensing nanomaterials in comparison with existing methods. Existing methods are mostly based on laboratory small quantity synthesis involving large amount of organic solvents, which not only adds a high cost for the manufacturing along with toxic wastes to the environment, but also diminish the viability of commercial scale manufacturing of the nanoparticles.  The proposed nanoparticle-structured air-quality sensors will have several unique features such as tunable sensing structure and increased sensor stability, and are anticipated to enable high sensitivity, high selectivity, and low detection limit. 

This project addresses an important technology gap, as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application, between low-cost sensor manufacturing and scalable nanomaterials preparation by establishing a large-scale and green synthesis route for manufacturing copper-gold alloy nanoparticles as printable micorelectrodes and sensitive scaffolds.  The proposed approach to synthesizing the alloy nanoparticles of different compositions by controlling aggregative nucleation and aggregative growth in aqueous solutions of highly-concentrated metal precursors will be tested. If successful, this will reduce the cost of the nanomaterials and create a green pathway that eliminates the use of large amounts of organic solvents as used in most of the existing synthesis protocols.  This synthesis scale up features a number of unique attributes, including tunable surface composition compatible to gold-based surface chemistry needed for the sensing film structure, increased stability in comparison with pure copper nanoparticles, and lower cost of the nanoparticles in comparison with pure gold nanoparticles without sacrificing the desired performance.  The combination of low-cost manufacturing, high sensitivity, and multiplexing capability of the sensors for detecting multiple VOCs is expected to be competitive in the sensor market in comparison with existing sensor products in the market manufactured by traditional microfabrication processes.  

Personnel involved in this project, including two graduate and two undergraduate student researchers, will receive training in terms of entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through active collaborations with industrial partners towards commercialization of the technology in the sensor market for environmental monitoring.  The project engages several industrial partners who have entrepreneurship experiences and are interested in licensing the nanoparticle and sensor technologies to test and evaluate the nanomaterials and sensor performances in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.","Cheng, Han-Wen and Wu, Zhi-Peng and Yan, Shan and Li, Jing and Shan, Shiyao and Wang, Lichang and Porter, Marc D. and Zhong, Chuan-Jian~A simple vaporous probe with atomic-scale sensitivity to structural ordering and orientation of molecular assembly~Chemical Science~10~2019~~~10.1039/C9SC01656B~10120486~7104 to 7110~10120486~OSTI~05/10/2019 17:02:21.970000000, Skeete, Zakiya and Cheng, Han-Wen and Li, Jing and Salazar, Christian and Sun, Winny and Ngo, Quang Minh and Lin, Liqin and Luo, Jin and Zhong, Chuan-Jian~Assessing Interparticle Spatial Characteristics of DNA-Linked Core?Shell Nanoparticles with or without Magnetic Cores in Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering~The Journal of Physical Chemistry C~121~2017~~~10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b03948~10074131~15767 to 15776~10074131~OSTI~02/09/2018 13:01:45.280000000, Cheng, Han-Wen and Yan, Shan and Han, Li and Chen, Yong and Kang, Ning and Skeete, Zakiya and Luo, Jin and Zhong, Chuan-Jian~Chemiresistive properties regulated by nanoscale curvature in molecularly-linked nanoparticle composite assembly~Nanoscale~9~2017~~~10.1039/C6NR09315A~10026237~4013 to 4023~10026237~OSTI~23/06/2017 01:02:39.230000000, Cheng, Han-Wen and Wang, Jie and Li, Yong-Jun and Li, Jing and Yan, Shan and Shan, Shiyao and Wang, Lingyan and Skeete, Zakiya and Zhong, Chuan-Jian~Nanoscale Lacing by Electrons~Small~14~2018~~~10.1002/smll.201800598~10074137~Article No. 1800598~10056781~OSTI~02/09/2018 13:01:44.646000000, Cheng, Han-Wen and Li, Jing and Wong, Season and Zhong, Chuan-Jian~Assessment of aggregative growth of MnZn ferrite nanoparticles~Nanoscale~8~2016~~~10.1039/C6NR06819G~10026238~19359 to 19367~10026238~OSTI~23/06/2017 01:02:39.440000000, Lombardi, Jack and Poliks, Mark D. and Zhao, Wei and Yan, Shan and Kang, Ning and Li, Jing and Luo, Jin and Zhong, Chuan-Jian and Pan, Ziang and Almihdhar, Mihdhar and Hsiao, Benjamin S. and Zabran, Madina L. and Mittal, Sandeep S. and Ghose, Kanad~Nanoparticle Based Printed Sensors on Paper for Detecting Chemical Species~2017 IEEE 67th Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)~~2017~~~10.1109/ECTC.2017.320~10074130~764 to 771~10074130~OSTI~02/09/2018 13:01:45.353000000, Cheng, Han-Wen and Yan, Shan and Li, Jing and Wang, Jie and Wang, Lingyan and Skeete, Zakiya and Shan, Shiyao and Zhong, Chuan-Jian~Electron Dose-Controlled Formation, Growth, and Assembly of Nanoclusters and Nanoparticles from Aurophilic Au(I)?Thiolate Ensemble on Surfaces~ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces~10~2018~~~10.1021/acsami.8b17941~10120487~40348 to 40357~10120487~OSTI~05/10/2019 17:02:23.86000000, Yan, Shan and Liu, Xin and Skeete, Zakiya and He, Ning and Xie, Zhi-Hui and Zhao, Wei and Lombardi, III, Jack P. and Liu, Kai and Kang, Ning and Luo, Jin and Hsiao, Benjamin S. and Poliks, Mark and Gitsov, Ivan and Zhong, Chuan-Jian~Decoration of Nanofibrous Paper Chemiresistors with Dendronized Nanoparticles toward Structurally Tunable Negative-Going Response Characteristics to Human Breathing and Sweating~Advanced Materials Interfaces~4~2017~~~10.1002/admi.201700380~10074134~1700380~10042031~OSTI~02/09/2018 13:01:45.160000000, Kang, Ning and Lin, Fang and Zhao, Wei and Lombardi, Jack P. and Almihdhar, Mihdhar and Liu, Kai and Yan, Shan and Kim, Juhee and Luo, Jin and Hsiao, Benjamin S. and Poliks, Mark and Zhong, Chuan-Jian~Nanoparticle?Nanofibrous Membranes as Scaffolds for Flexible Sweat Sensors~ACS Sensors~1~2016~~~10.1021/acssensors.6b00414~10026239~1060 to 1069~10026239~OSTI~23/06/2017 01:02:39.383000000",,"The goal of this PFI-AIR Technology Translation project is to translate a patented nanoparticle-structured sensor technology to potential commercialization by addressing the need for a large-scale and green route towards low-cost synthesis of nanoparticles as printable nanomaterials for manufacturing the sensors.

This product would fill an existing need to monitor and assess the conditions of aging US infrastructures. No existing product on the market offers real-time continuous operational fatigue prognosis and remaining life predictions, thus creating a market niche for the FHP. Full development, licensing, and commercialization of the FHP is vital as the US infrastructure ages, deteriorates and is thus increasingly ""load-posted"" (not recommended for transportation of materials and goods using heavier trucks). Load posting of bridges has major societal and commercial impact on the US market and economy and results in enormous costs of maintenance, retrofit, and replacement of the US highway bridges. An intelligent decision-oriented methodology can exploit real-time measured data and analysis, resulting in a more effective use of such information for infrastructure health monitoring and management. It will support a paradigm shift in the fatigue assessment profession to enable a data-driven and decision-oriented tool that can evolve as more structural response data is collected.

The target market for this methodology is bridge managers and owners concerned with limited service life due to fatigue of steel elements. The broader target market is any structural engineer interested in data-driven intelligent decision-making with respect to fatigue assessment of in-service structures, such as transmission towers or amusement park rides. Under this project, two full-scale bridges and one other structural type will be the case studies for validation of the proposed methodologies, allowing refinement of the analytical methods and experimental techniques to address challenges of commercialization. The project will result in a FHP prototype software package with proof-of-concept that meets the need for improved decision-making in infrastructure asset management. It will integrate structural health monitoring concepts, analytical fatigue life prediction, and advanced nonparametric statistical methods to enable real-time fatigue assessment and prognosis to be used for decision-making and asset management. This project addresses the following technology gaps for real-time decision-making: (1) efficient and reliable wireless sensors, data acquisition, cloud computing, and data communications, (2) nonparametric decision-oriented probabilistic operational methods for infrastructure fatigue assessments, and (3) prognosis and prediction of remaining infrastructure fatigue life. 

The FHP has the following unique features: variable fatigue stress ranges, operational measured strains, unknown vehicle information, hypothesis testing for damage assessment, and use of an alert system that improves system safety. These features provide the following advantages: real-time structural fatigue life assessment using real-time measured strains, and use of efficient computational methodologies, which are cost effective when compared to the leading competing products and technology in this market space. This research collaboration, which involves three departments (Civil Engineering, Computer Science, and Economics) at two universities (Tufts University and University of New Hampshire), will strive to include underrepresented groups at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school level (students and teachers). In addition, personnel involved in this project will receive innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation experiences through product development, proof of concept, capstone projects, and licensing process of the IP. The academic and industrial partners of this project are looking forward to working together to transform research discoveries into market-ready products.

The lead institution is Tufts University with its departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, and Economics.

Advanced permanent magnets underlie operation of myriad devices and machines, including hybrid/electric vehicles, direct-drive wind turbines, motors and generators and thus are technologically and industrially important.  At present, advanced permanent magnets require rare-earth metals that are in limited supply in the current situation of the global supply chain. Equiatomic FeNi with the chemically ordered tetragonal structure, known as tetrataenite, is found naturally only in selected meteorites subjected to extraordinarily long cooling periods and has been confirmed to exhibit excellent permanent magnetic properties. This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project will deliver enabling proof-of-concept synthesis and processing protocols, based on existing industrial metallurgical techniques, to greatly accelerate the formation of tetrataenite to industrially-relevant timescales. The end-stage magnets made from the synthesized tetratenite will not only feature maximum theoretical energy products that approach 66% of those characterizing the best rare-earth-based magnets, but are also anticipated to exhibit high-temperature performance exceeding that of the best neodymium (Nd) based magnets. In addition, complementing clear advantages in cost and supply chain availability, such magnets would exhibit superior corrosion resistance and associated extended technological lifetimes.  

This project will provide enabling insight into the conditions and processes necessary to favor the formation of tetrataenite, as well as inform microstructural aspects of this material as it transitions from the research lab to commercial production and application. In particular, techniques to simultaneously apply controlled processing parameters, such as temperature, strain and magnetic field, will be designed and implemented. Parallel development of transport measurement protocols to identify the earliest stages of desired phase formation from the parent alloy will be conducted. In addition, personnel involved in this project (one post-doctoral associate, one graduate student and undergraduate cooperative education internship students) will receive experiences in the science, engineering and technology of permanent magnetic materials, including industrial and global supply chain perspectives.

This project engages Rogers Corporation at the Rogers Innovation Center in Burlington, Mass. and at Rogers Headquarters in Rogers, Conn., to build closer linkages between academic research at Northeastern University, industry know-how, and commercialization of research. In this manner materials solutions to address global challenges for clean energy and safety and security will be pursued, facilitating and accelerating translation from research discovery toward commercial reality.",,,"The major goal of this project was to accelerate the formation of the tetragonal L10phase of equiatomic FeNi (tetrataenite) while creating a tailored (quasi mono-variant) microstructure in laboratory timescales. This material has proven potential as an excellent permanent magnet that is free of critical elements, but its formation is so extraordinarily slow that it is only found in Nature in the slowest-cooled meteorites. Intellectual Merit: In this work, the simultaneous application of external forces (stress, saturating magnetic field) during heat treatment of selected ferromagnetic L10-type alloys has been confirmed to stabilize tetragonality/uniaxiality in these samples, as well as deliver a smaller unit cell volume than that of the as-received, unprocessed material. These results were obtained from samples processed using a MultiDriver Furnace designed, built and implemented during this project. Additionally, design and construction of a variable-temperature electron transport apparatus was conducted, allowing assessment of phase transformations during heating. This apparatus was validated by investigation of phase transitions in MnAl alloys. Broader Impacts: Two REU undergraduate students (one URM) in addition to 2 volunteer undergraduate engineering students, 2 Ph.D. students and 2 post-doctoral scholars were mentored under the auspices of this project. One invention disclosure was prepared and submitted. Five students were trained in operation of synchrotron-based high energy X-ray diffraction as well as in analysis of data from these experiments.

Cells grown in vitro are critically useful tools in biomedical research and development. Recent research in the area of in vitro cell growth has led to a number of important discoveries with regards to how cells behave and respond to their environment. These discoveries have significantly altered the way that researchers think about how cells grow; however, few commercial products reflecting this knowledge exist, possibly causing bottlenecks in applications ranging from in vitro fertilization (IVF) to disease model development for pharmaceutical testing. The project will result in a family of cell culture substrate prototypes designed to improve cell growth and development over the traditional flat polystyrene surfaces currently used in the industry today.  The prototypes will be designed for high-volume manufacturing to ensure commercial usefulness and cost-effectiveness in the biomedical sector. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  First, traditional silicon tooling for multi-scale molding at the micro/nanoscale is cost-prohibitive.  Second, the high-volume manufacturing of injection-molded polymeric devices that possess features at the low micro to nanoscale is currently limited by factors such as tooling life and manufacturing robustness.  Third, a robust in vitro cell response to such products is required for future commercialization.  To address these technology gaps, the team will employ designs inspired by native cell environments, using a well-established in vitro cell growth assay for mouse embryos. Molds for high volume manufacturing will be produced using bulk metallic glass tooling, on which mold robustness will be analyzed.  Polymer rheology will be controlled in a variety of ways to ensure feature consistency and reproducibility.  Costs associated with mold production and other tooling will be built into the current working financial model to determine the next phase of the commercialization effort.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a graduate student and a team of undergraduate/high school students will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experience by developing the designs, talking to potential customers, and aiding with the development of a commercialization plan for the technology.","Ali Rajhi, Israd Jaafar, John P.

The objective of the work was to develop multi-scale polymeric products with critical surface features inspired by biology.  These surfaces were designed to enhance cell division by providing topographical features (Figure 1) that were consistent with feature sizes found in human tissues. These features were designed to be produced using high throughput manufacturing strategies, primarily using injection molding (Figure 2). The researchers aimed to fill a technological gap between traditional, flat-bottomed petri dishes using in cell culture and the expansive knowledge about cell-surface interactions and how these interactions contribute to robust cell growth. The following major outcomes were realized: 

1)    The team identified 8 different surface designs and produced mold tooling for these designs.

2)    The engineered surface topography was shown to influence cell division dynamics. Mesenchymal stem cells were used as the cell model, due to their potential use in tissue engineering, and the challenges associated with scaling ex vivo growth of these cells (Figures 3-5)

3)    The team was able to produce large scale batches of surfaces prior to mold failure.

4)    The team has advanced the capability of using bulk metallic glass to extend tooling lifetime for multi-scale injection molding technology.

There are a number of future technologies (both within and outside of biomedical consumables) that could be enabled as a result of this commercialization effort.  We anticipate translating the ability to produce industrially relevant batches of multi-scaled products for industrial sectors ranging from biomedicine to energy.

Advanced resilient microgrid technology provides continuous electric service to support critical services to people displaced during extreme disasters; and provides electric service to support recovery crews working to restore services. In an emergency, the microgrid is an electrical ""island"", idependent of the main power grid and serves these critical loads through local power generation. This project will focus on the human-machine operational impacts of the microgrid both during normal operations as well as during disaster response. The development of ""smart scheduler"" technology  will enable the microgrid  operator  and  the  local  disaster  response  team  to  maximize  the  microgrid's performance during the disaster recovery. The microgrid must operate successfully disconnected from the grid for two weeks or more in catastrophic situations where the level of damage is unanticipated and the microgrid itself has experienced reduced capability. Human-machine capability will be developed to respond to rapidly changing community needs with a minimum of human effort.

The project will complement ongoing projects to plan and design a resilient underground microgrid in Potsdam, New York. The Potsdam microgrid features a unique partnership of generator owners, local government, regulated utility, and critical load entities. This diverse set of microgrid partners is key to providing the resilience required of the microgrid. At the same time, designing, building, and operating the microgrid as a unit with its diverse set of owners presents a range of challenges. Developing the capability to schedule and control the microgrid in both normal and emergency events is a critical element of this project. Equally important is the development of a microgrid design that provides this service at a minimum cost, by maximizing the benefit of the microgrid assets during the normal operation.

The lead institution is Clarkson University (Coulter School of Engineering, School of Business, and School of Arts and Sciences). The primary industrial partner on the project is National Grid USA (Waltham, MA), the electric service provider for a large part of New York and New England, including Potsdam, NY. National Grid would own the underground distribution network  that  is  the  backbone  of  the  microgrid.  The  Electric  Power  Research Institute, Knoxville, TN, is the broader context partner on the project. In Potsdam, NY, Clarkson University, SUNY Potsdam, the Village of Potsdam, and Canton-Potsdam Hospital are among the entities that would participate in the microgrid and are potential generation owners on the microgrid.","Yikui Liu, Jie Li, Lei Wu, and Tom Ortmeyer~Chordal Relaxation Based ACOPF for Unbalanced Three-Phase Distribution Systems with Voltage Regulation Transformers and DERs~IEEE Transactions on Power Systems~33~2018~970~~0885-8950~0~ ~0~ ~04/09/2018 14:08:37.20000000, Bird, Stephen, and Chelsea Hotaling~Multi-Stakeholder Microgrids for Resilience and Sustainability~Environmental Hazards~16~2017~116~~10.1080/17477891.2016.1263181~0~ ~0~ ~04/09/2018 14:08:36.973000000, Lei Wu, Jie Li, Melike Erol Kantarci, and Burak Kantarci~An Integrated Reconfigurable Control and Self-Organizing Communication Framework for Community Resilience Microgrids~The Electricity Journal~30~2017~27~~~0~ ~0~ ~15/07/2017 08:41:17.613000000, Yikui Liu, Jie Li, and Lei Wu~State Estimation of Three-Phase Four-Conductor Distribution Systems with Real-Time Data from Selective Smart Meters~IEEE Transactions on Power Systems~34~2019~2632~~10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2892726~0~ ~0~ ~14/11/2019 14:54:36.896000000, Shengyi Wang, Jie Li, and Lei Wu~An Integrated Distributed Economic Dispatch-Droop Control Architecture for Distribution System Operation~IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting 2018.~~2018~~~~0~ ~0~ ~04/09/2018 14:08:36.980000000, Shouxing Wang, Leijiao Ge, Shengxia Cai, and Lei Wu~Hybrid interval AHP-entropy method for electricity user evaluation in smart electricity utilization~Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy~6~2018~701~~2196-5625~0~ ~0~ ~04/09/2018 14:08:36.983000000, Yikui Liu, Jie Li, Lei Wu, Qinzhen Liu~Ex-Post Real-Time Distribution LMP Based on State Estimation~IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting 2016~~2016~~~1944-9933~0~ ~0~ ~15/07/2017 08:41:17.646000000, Wei Wei, Jianhui Wang, and Lei Wu~Distribution Optimal Power Flow with Real-time Price Elasticity~IEEE Transactions on Power Systems~33~2018~1097~~2196-5625~0~ ~0~ ~04/09/2018 14:08:36.990000000, T.

These extended outages could result from extreme weather events, human action, or system failure.  Developing the capability to provide reliable electric power for critical services during these extreme events will have a significant positive benefits for the communities facing the extended loss of electric service.

The successful development of resilient community microgrid technology, however, faces significant challenges.  This project focusses on the development of smart scheduler technology and the advancement of human factors issues that stand in the way in the sucessful development of these microgrids.

Smart Scheduler Thrust

In this project, we developed a restructuring strategy and market clearing framework for both normal and islanded operation of the microgrid.  It is essential to recover as much of the microgrid cost as possible during normal conditions when connected to the bulk power system.  During the rare instances of stand alone operation in response to extreme events, it is equally essential to provide the available electric power to the most critical services.  The microgrid must have sufficient flexibility to recognize and respond to the loss of key components of the microgrid that may be damaged by the event, and unavailable.  In this project, we developed a reconfiguration model and market clearing framework to accomplish these tasks.  We also developed microgrid specific economic dispatch and droop control methods for the microgrids, including those with significant renewable energy resources. 

Human Factors Thrust

HMI Development  The Human Factors Engineering team focused on developing methods that improve situational awareness for microgrid operators.  While grid operators have the single task of maintaining grid performance, microgrid operators will have many and diverse tasks, particularly during extreme events.  In this project, two competing human-machine operator interfaces were developed, along with a real time microgrid simulator. Tests were conducted on the HMI?s for their effectiveness. 
 
 
Policy and Governance. Community microgrid governance can be a major issue developing these projects.  In the study case used in this project, partners included the franchise holding utility, a hospital, a state university, the local high school, the village, a private university, and several commercial firms.  In this study case, we determined that it is much preferable to partner with the utility than to create an entity that would hold power delivery rights superimposed on the franchise area.  A key factor was that the utility has significant expertise in operating and maintaining system components that none of the other stakeholders has.  This also avoids a major regulatory barrier in overriding the franchise holder?s rights.  We identified regulatory and institutional barriers due to the differing federal and state regulations that are applied to the hospital, universities, village, and school.  
 
 On this and related projects, we developed a consortium model for microgrid governance, with a tiered recovery system.  The consortium would be charged with operating and maintaining the microgrid, apportioning costs, managing revenues and paying bills.  It would be governed by a board of local stakeholders including the franchise holder.  In the tiered recovery system, customers connected to the microgrid would pay the largest share of the wires expenses, those served by village services but not on the microgrid would be at the next level of costs, and so on out to the full hospital service territory&mdash;with those whose benefit is only due to the hospital paying the least.  Tiered recovery would recover costs due to the wires and controller.  A group or groups would also need to step forward and add the needed generation, and recover those costs through selling their energy and other services during both blue sky and emergency conditions.   


 

In the final phase of the project, the effort was spent focusing on the development of a survey of residential consumers to determine willingness to pay (WTP) for various services powered by a microgrid. This survey explores a variety of factors that may influence a community?s acceptance of Microgrid Services, and also analyzes different potential associated resiliency services that a Microgrid could provide during extended outages. Extensive time was spent developing the experimental design and building the bank of questions to elicit personality, economic, and other factors that may be correlated with a consumer's WTP.  The results showed a significant willingness to pay for residential consumers, in order to ensure the availability of the critical services that would be available as a result of the microgrid?s presence.

Since buildings consume a large fraction of society's total energy usage, even modest improvements in building energy efficiency have the potential to yield significant benefits.  In recent years, utilities have deployed tens of millions of smart electric meters that record building energy usage over short intervals (e.g., every few minutes).  While the original purpose of smart meters was to support basic utility operations (e.g., automated meter reading), this project uses them as the foundation for developing a new class of smart energy service systems.  Specifically, the project focuses on analyzing the vast amount of data available from utility smart meters and other networked sensors to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and the electric grid.  The research is utility-driven, since utilities have i) access to massive amounts of customer energy data, ii) a way to deliver the results of analytics to customers, and iii) strong incentives to improve customer energy efficiency (e.g., by reducing peak demand to reduce their own operational costs).  The approach is scalable, since it leverages already available building smart meter data, rather than requiring the installation of new smart devices and control systems. 

The project will develop utility-driven smart energy services to improve grid energy efficiency, encourage energy conservation, and promote the local renewable energy sources, such as rooftop solar. The research methodology includes developing new energy analytic techniques for smart meter data, combining these in novel ways to create specific applications that improve energy efficiency, packaging those applications as cloud-based web services that are accessible to end users, and evaluating their impact on user behavior and energy efficiency.  In particular, the project will develop three specific smart energy service systems:  i) iProgram to determine optimal thermostat schedules by analyzing smart meter data, ii) Green Demand Response (Green-DR) to opportunistically schedule elastic loads to align with renewable energy generation, and iii) PowerTrip to provide real-time energy event notifications and suggested conservation actions to users.  The project will implement a prototype of each system and evaluate them on real-world data (rendered anonymous) from 18,000 smart meters.  The research follows a human-in-the-loop model that integrates technical and user behavioral research in the design and implementation of smart energy services. Thus, the project includes user studies to assess each service's behavioral impact on users.

Broader impacts stem from the project's industrial partnerships with a local utility, a premier research lab (Microsoft Research), a small startup company (Budderfly), and an environmentally-conscious non-profit (WattTime.org).  These partnerships will expose students to industry perspectives on addressing real-world energy-efficiency problems, and interdisciplinary research that spans technical and behavioral disciplines.  The project will enable sustainability-aware curriculum, undergraduate REU projects, and sustainability-focused outreach efforts to local K-12 students through the newly established Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center.

Every year, millions of dollars are lost due to red tides and HABs throughout the US and the world. Losses can be direct, such as human illnesses and deaths from the consumption of contaminated food or the mortality of fish and shellfish resources, or indirect, such as the avoidance of all seafood products during red tides, even products that are safe. Management of areas threatened by HAB toxins currently involves monitoring programs that rely on weekly flesh-testing of shellfish collected from many locations along a coast.  These programs are expensive, slow, providing protection through conservative harvesting closure policies that have not changed for decades. Red tide management can be greatly improved through the use of technological advances such as the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP), a submersible, self-contained ""laboratory-in-a-can"" that collects water samples and identifies molecules or genes that indicate the presence of hazardous species of algae. ESPs operate autonomously for months and transmit data, including environmental conditions, to shore. The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate ESPnet, a system that will utilize these novel biosensors to provide environmental awareness and decision support capabilities for resource managers charged with protecting public health and the viability of fisheries industries and tourism from toxic HABs. This system is transformational, as it applies a new sensor technology to a major resource management problem that is currently addressed through monitoring programs that are expensive, slow, and outdated. No other service system of this type currently exists for managing HABs, microbial pathogens, or other water-borne diseases or problems.

ESPnet will be based on a network of ESPs that will supply real-time, high-frequency HAB surveillance information through a web portal complete with automated data analysis and visualization tools, allowing managers to view the coastal environment with unprecedented detail so they can act decisively and effectively. The three-year project will include field deployments of multiple ESPs at key locations along the Gulf of Maine (GOM) coast. The project team will work with their industry partner, McLane Research Laboratories, to modify ESP hardware and software to reduce power consumption and extend deployments to fully sample the HAB season in the GOM.  Meeting the overall goal of this project requires a development effort to fully automate ESP data analysis and to merge that with geospatially rendered environmental measurements; this system must be tailored to non-experts and available via a user-friendly data portal. Human factors will be addressed through identification of user groups and characterization of receptivities to the new system, optimization of the manner in which system information is supplied to users, characterization of feedback among user groups, and estimation of economic costs and benefits from the ESPnet technology. 

This project addresses fundamental issues underlying management of the most widespread of all HAB poisoning syndromes--paralytic shellfish poisoning or PSP. Project activities thus have important societal benefits.  The ESPnet concept can be applied to PSP problems elsewhere in the U.S., as well as to other HAB poisoning syndromes, and to a host of non-HAB problems that affect water quality, such as viruses and microbial pathogens. This project therefore satisfies the criterion ""fostering connections between discoveries and their use in the service of society"".  This project has extensive undergraduate and graduate training, as multiple students and interns will be involved. Project results will be broadly disseminated through scientific papers, workshop and conference presentations, and discussions with the media. This project thus meets NSF's Broader Impact Criterion II through ""advancing discovery in understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning"".

The INPHAMIS technique is a breakthrough technology in that it provides unprecedented, centimeter resolution to map submerged objects in shallow waters, seamlessly identifies land-to-water transitions, obtains high precision water depth measurements, and provides precise description of bottom surface topography, all from remote distances above the water. Submerged objects are the number one cause of insurance claims in watercraft and the ability to detect them in advance would take care of both a human safety concern and an economic concern. Market research indicates this type of lidar system would contribute to growing markets in the mapping of lakes, shallow glacial melt-ponds, mosquito habitat, coastal erosion, and flood basins, and provide navigation information through inlets and channels that is crucial in these ever evolving environments.  The end commercial goal is to develop a mobile lidar bathymetric unit to be used for local surveys either by boat, handheld, or possibly on dirigibles or unmanned aerial systems.

The INPHAMIS technique has the following unique features: 1-cm resolution in resolving objects in shallow waters, simple lidar components, noninvasive/non-contact, remote sensing technique based on a differential measurement, continuous observing over land-water transitions, and scalability to support several types of observing platforms. INPHAMIS is a disruptive technology in that it achieves high resolution subsurface mapping in water while reducing complexity and cost. Other remote sensing techniques are limited to waters deeper than a meter or more, leaving a large portion of near-shore waters unmapped. Existing lidar bathymetry systems are all quite similar in terms of intended use and capabilities and all involve large, expensive airborne systems. The INPHAMIS technique's unique features provide advantages in performance, costs, mass, power, volume, and adaptability that opens a new market in shallow-water water bathymetry by enabling the near-future development of a hand-held system for underwater mapping and subsurface target identification.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) interactions of laser light with different surface water conditions, submerged objects, and bottom surface types; 2) performance factors and definition of system and measurement specifications; 3) trade analysis of critical lidar components. A lab demonstrator of the technique will be advanced to evaluate laser light interactions with water bodies and objects in real environmental shallow-water conditions. This will also provide data on establishing performance factors and component testing. A faculty member, graduate student, and an undergraduate student will be involved providing a unique learning environment in entrepreneurship and technology translation, with support from industry partner, ASTRA LLC, and their staff and engineers.

The project engages industry partner, ASTRA LLC, which will contribute engineering experience and perform commercialization and marketing studies to assess market space, competitive environment, explore licensing opportunities and further commercialization of the technology. This strong partnership is poised to move this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.","Barton-Grimley, R. A., J. P. Thayer, and M.

A future embodiment of this technology was to build a low-cost, high-precision water-depth measuring device that delivers extreme accuracy in a compact package. To achieve this goal required particular knowledge gaps to be addressed. These knowledge gaps cover three topical areas: 1) fundamental interactions of polarized light with different surface water conditions and bottom surface types; 2) performance factors and definition of system and measurement specifications that will lead to a future prototype design; 3) trade analysis including costs of critical lidar components to establish a market price point.
Intellectual Merit:
All milestones and goals were met and we have successfully advanced the lidar capability to be commercially viable. A summary of research outcomes include: 1) performed lab tests and developed simulation tools to evaluate lidar performance with surface-waves. The lidar measurements of underwater objects were distorted by a few centimeters due to the variability in water surface slope and amplitude, 2) reduced the size, power and mass of the lidar unit to less than 5 kg making it able to fly on a drone, 3) performed outside  measurement tests from bridges over local waterways and was able to map the underwater bathymetry, 4) gained flight experience by deploying the instrument on the NCAR GV research aircraft by leveraging the NSF grant through the NCAR ARISTO program, 5) performed a live demonstration of the unique lidar capability over a rushing indoor river flume at the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) facility, 6) advanced data analysis to provide real-time visualization capability of the lidar measurements, 7) delivered a custom unit to USACE, 8) carried out an extensive business and marketing plan, 9) wrote small business proposals to seek additional funds for product advancement to commercialization, 10) filed additional provisional patents, and 11) developed the first lidar product called Edge? LiDAR by ASTRALiTe.
Broader Impacts:
In February 2019, ASTRALiTe released their first lidar product, Edge? LiDAR by ASTRALiTe at the annual International Lidar Mapping Forum ? see image. Edge? is the world's first small-scale topographic and bathymetric scanning LiDAR that can detect small underwater objects, measure shallow water depth, and survey critical underwater infrastructure from a small UAV platform. CU?s patented 2-in-1 topo-bathy LiDAR overcomes the limitations of traditional bathymetric LiDAR, measuring underwater features at centimeter-level depth resolution. From coastal mapping and surveying, to infrastructure inspection and military logistics, the applications of AstraLiTe?s LiDAR are numerous and widespread.
The project included training of students and professional development. An REU student, Mr. Bryce Garby, was supported which eventually led to him earning a Masters degree in Aerospace Engineering from CU based on the research related to this grant. CU Aerospace Engineering junior, Mr. Dawson Beatty, worked on the lidar data retrieved from the NCAR GV flight during the ARISTO ?17 campaign. Dawson?s DLA project involved georeferencing and noise filtering of airborne lidar data from the NCAR GV lidar measurements. CU Aerospace Engineering PhD student, Rory Barton-Grimley, was supported by the grant which accelerated his understanding of designing, building, testing and verifying a novel instrument. He advanced the INPHAMIS system by analyzing its performance characteristics and has been instrumental in carrying out experiments to test and evaluate the system, in addition to performing all hardware fabrication needed for the field deployment experiments. He was lead on the NCAR GV deployment and flew on all flights. This experience has reinforced Rory?s commitment to instrument development for application to the geosciences and is now employed at NASA Langley to work on airborne lidar systems. ASTRALiTe lidar research engineer, Andy Gisler, has been the liaison between CU and ASTRALiTe. Andy is a former Masters student of Prof. Thayer?s and was hired by ASTRALiTe to work on lidar technologies. Andy is very familiar with the INPHAMIS technique and has contributed significantly to making strides in advancing the technology to a commercial reality. The NSF AIR funding has enabled Andy to take a lead role in the commercial aspects of demonstrating and evolving the instrument for future applications.
The advancements made over the course of this project are a testament to the IIP Acceleration Innovation Research - Technology Translation project purpose of overcoming technology barriers or knowledge gaps in the transformation of fundamental science and engineering discoveries into market-valued solutions. The CU / ASTRALiTe team has worked fervently to engage commercial sectors through marketing and customer engagement activities, advance software visualization capabilities, improve lidar system components, and demonstrate the capabilities of the technology.

The technology has the following market-valued features: the Allomatrix family of polymers uses raw materials from renewable resources, and is a potential replacement of halobutyl rubber, which is used to make the gas-barrier inner liner of car tires and pharmaceutical stoppers. It also has the potential to be used as a rubbery biomaterial that can be processed as plastic and can be recycled, with better combination of properties than silicone rubber. These features provide the following advantages: the performance of commercial halobutyl rubber without the presence of harmful halogens, and an improved cost-effective manufacturing process with a smaller carbon footprint. The Allomatrix technology is important because it uses raw materials from renewable resources, is expected to reduce the carbon footprint of current butyl and halobutyl manufacturing processes (600,000 tons/year), may lead to improved pharmaceutical stoppers and provide improved rubbery biomaterials for saving lives. If successful, this project has the potential to bring back high value-added manufacturing to the USA, creating jobs in the STEM disciplines.  
  The innovative ecosystem that will be created includes partners such as Honeywell, Parker Hannifin, Bridgestone/Firestone, a small biotech company (Innovia), and LG Hausys.  Third party investors include the Rubber Division of the American Chemical Society by creating the International Center of Advanced Elastomers for Healthcare, and the Breast Cancer Innovation Foundation supporting the research if integrating breast reconstruction with cancer diagnosis and treatment. The potential economic impact is expected to be significant, creating new jobs in high value added manufacturing, new commercial products and students well-trained for the created jobs in the next 2-10 years   Students (high-school, undergraduate and graduate) will gain entrepreneurial and technology translation experience through the transfer of the Allomatix technology into commercial products. Students will be motivated and challenged to develop novel ideas, and to defend the feasibility of their ideas in front of industrial partners.  
  This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: to produce halogen-free rubber on a commercial scale that can compete with current halobutyl rubber; reduce the carbon footprint of the manufacturing process; produce thermoplastic biocompatible rubber with a much cheaper and simpler process. The proposed objectives in the PFI:AIR are based on the Allomatrix technology. This new family of materials is the basis for all objectives, thus the first step is to scale up the polymerization and to produce sufficient material for product development and testing. In objective II we aim to develop an optimized sulfur curing system for tire applications, and non-sulfur curing systems for biomedical and other applications. In objective III new application development will be implemented with various partners based on the favorable properties of Allomatrix family of polymers. In objective IV the potential of the reduction of the carbon footprint of the polymerization system is examined. This objective is based on the insight of the polymerization system that was acquired during the development and optimization stages of the CenTiRe project. Lastly, objective V focuses on the examination of the feasibility of the material to be used in biomedical applications, such as investigation of cytotoxicity, material stability under physiological conditions and other aspects.","Zhao, Y.R.; Arriola, D.J.; Puskas, J.E.; McAuley, K.B.~Applying Multidimensional Method of Moments for Modeling and Estimating Parameters for Arborescent Polyisobutylene Production in Batch Reactor~Macromol.

The project will result in a proof-of-concept, optical-fiber-based light source for spectroscopy applications. This miniature light source has the following unique features: the device is fabricated directly on an optical fiber; the material system is highly efficient; and the light spectrum of the system can be tuned to a desirable output. These features provide advantages of smaller size, lower power consumption and less heat generation when compared to the leading competing spectroscopy light sources in this market space. This project addresses important technology gaps in the translation from research discovery toward commercial application.  These gaps include: the demonstration that newly discovered carbon nanotube-based materials can significantly improve lighting efficiency in an electroluminescent device structure; that the new device structure can be integrated directly onto optical fiber; and that the resulting device meets the requirements of a light source for battery-powered spectroscopy.

The project engages Duke University, Wake Forest University and Zenalux Biomedical, Inc. to build the devices and carry out application-specific testing in this effort to translate a new technology from research discovery toward commercial reality.  This new miniature light source is important due to the need for light sources in numerous medical diagnostic applications such as the detection of cancer cells. In addition, it is ultimately expected to have even broader impact because all the requirements being addressed in the project are directly applicable to developing cheaper, more efficient and more adaptable lighting for everyday household needs.",,,"The goal of this project was to create a fiber-optic light source for use in the Zenalux Zenascope, which is a spectrometer-based cancer diagnostic device that specializes in the detection of cervical cancer. Eventually, Zenalux would like to reduce the size and cost of the Zenascope so that it is feasible to use in developing countries.
 
The first step in this process is to reduce the size and cost of the light source, which is currently a halogen lamp. Through this NSF:PFI grant, we were able to develop a fiber-optic based light guide with a surface mounted field-induced polymer electroluminescent (FIPEL) thin-film light source. Although the FIPEL light source itself is not novel, this is the first time that it has been integrated with a fiber-optic based light guide.
 
After developing the fiber-optic light source, the device was integrated as the light source for the Zenascope. Unfortunately, due to losses and poor coupling, we were unable to obtain an accurate spectroscopic scan. However, this integration served as a proof of concept that a fiber-optic based light could potentially serve as the source for a mobile spectrometer, while reducing the overall size of the device.         
 
In addition to integration with the Zenascope, the geometry of this cylindrical FIPEL light source also makes it a candidate for other applications. The surface-mounted geometry of this device allows for greater emissive surface area, which could be useful in larger scale lighting solutions such as office troffers. Increased active surface area means that large illumination panels could potentially be fabricated with smaller lighting units, reducing the overall size and cost of the panel.

The collective goal is to produce a commercially viable path to the next generation of Li-ion batteries (LIB) and a new generation of thermal Li-Sulfur (TLS) batteries.  The translated science and technology of UNCD-based LIB and TLS have the following unique features: i) high performance anodes based on electrically conductive UNCD-coated metal anodes to increase the battery lifetime by at least 10x with respect to current technologies, ii) UNCD-based membranes for Li+ ions transport with at least 10x higher resistance to battery environmental and chemical attacks than for current batteries, and iii) UNCD films as extremely chemically resistant coatings for the battery inner walls case to substantially lower the cost, extend cells' life-cycle, and improve the economic viability of the end product. Currently, much more expensive metals would be required to survive the targeted x10 longer life time (given exposure to the harsh environment of the LIB and TLS batteries). This PFI AIR project intends to deliver a TLS battery that has a potential volumetric energy density of 2,600 Wh/l with a theoretical specific energy density of 2,500 Wh/kg, which is at least x10 superior performance to current battery technologies. The state-of-the-art for cathodes and anodes (two critical components) for this couple currently features a theoretical volumetric energy density of 2,125 Wh/l and a theoretical specific energy density of 597 Wh/kg. The resulting TLS approach will provide 22% improvement in volumetric energy density and ~400% improvement in specific energy density over existing secondary LIB technologies, when compared to the leading competing LIB science/technology from manufacturers in this market space.  
The project accomplishes its objectives by developing: i)  boron-doped UNCD (B-UNCD) and nitrogen-grain boundary incorporated (N-UNCD) coated metallic electrodes (e.g, tungsten (W), titanium (Ti), or W-coated Cu) to determine which is the best anode material to insert in the new generation of LIB and TLS batteries, ii) the best approach between a patented chemical etching processes from Advanced Diamond Technologies (ADT) and UNCD-coated Si-based or anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes used as templates to produce 10x more chemically robust UNCD-based membranes than current battery membranes, and iii) chemically resistant UNCD coating for the inner walls of the battery metal case to make it possible to use a less expensive metal material as opposed to currently used  molybdenum that is both expensive and chemically less resistant. A prototype coin-type battery will be demonstrated as a proof-of-concept of the novel UNCD-based LIB and TLS battery technologies for defibrillators/pacemakers, cell phones, and computers. The new UNCD-based battery technology will be scalable to produce larger batteries for larger systems such as car batteries. 
The partnership engages researchers from the University of Texas at Dallas (Materials Science and Engineering Department), who will provide N-UNCD coatings for the battery anodes and UNCD-coated membranes based on the Si and AAO templates. The industrial and commercialization partner is Advanced Diamond Technologies (ADT), a company currently expanding the commercial application of thin smooth diamond. ADT will provide the expertise for developing the B-UNCD films as alternative electrically conductive coatings for battery anodes, as described above. In addition, ADT will provide expertise on customer identification, engagement and commercialization, as well as manage production of the diamond coated battery components (pre-integration) and public introduction of the first LIB/TLS batteries in the market. The infrastructure is already in place in ADT facilities to translate the UNCD coating science/technology along a path that will result in a competitive commercial reality for a new generation of LIB and TLS batteries with potentially 10x better performance than current batteries.  
The potential economic impact includes domestic production of high energy density cells expected to become viable in the next five years, and will re-engage the US as a competitive fixture in the batteries market space with key, targeted market segments in medical devices/systems, mobile communication devices, computers and many other systems requiring long life low cost batteries.   The societal impact, long term, will be in the form of i) at least 10x smaller/longer life for medical implants (i.e., defibrillators/pacemakers), which will impact positively the quality of life of people requiring these devices, and ii) longer life/smaller batteries to power more efficient cell phones, portable computers, and other electronic devices.",,,"NSF PFI Award # 1343461 Outcomes

 

The outcomes of the PFI/AIR Technology Translation project, titled ""Ultrananocrystalline Diamond (UNCD) Coating Technology for Integrated Electrode-Membrane-Inner Wall Coating of Case for Robust/Reliable Commercial Li-Sulfur Batteries"" were the following:

Development of a unique corrosion resistant electrically conductive coating of diamond, named nitrogen incorporated ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD), in the form of a film with grain sizes of 5-10 nm (0.0000003-5 cm), and nitrogen incorporated into the gain boundaries and providing electrons for conduction. The N-UNCD films were grown on natural graphite/copper anodes (electrode supplying power from the battery to the device to which the battery is connected) (see Fig. 1 attached in the outcomes section) used in commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs). The UNCD coating protects the NG/Cu anodes from corrosion, enabling an order of magnitude longer life of the LIBs with appropriate energy capacity (see Fig. 2A attached in the outcomes section), due to elimination of chemical attack and degradation induced by the Li environment (see Fig. 2B attached in the outcomes section). The N-UNCD films were grown using a microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition technique featuring insertion of a mixture of argon (Ar), methane (CH4), nitrogen (N2) gases into a chamber where air was evacuated with appropriate pumps to make vacuum. Microwave power (similar to the microcowave power used in the microwave oven used to cook food) crack the CH4 molecule producing C-based molecules (C2 dimers and CHx (x=1,2,3), which  move toward the solid anode exposed to the plasma. The C-based molecules landing on the surface of the anode, heated to temperature in the range 500-700 ?C, induce the growth of the N-UNCD coating on the anode surface.
Development of corrosion resistant UNCD coatings, using hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD), to cover the inner surface of stainless steel (SS) metal used for fabrication of cases that contain the Li-ion batteries components. The HFCVD process involves inserting a mixture of (Ar), methane (CH4), and hydrogen (H2) gases into a chamber where air was evacuated with appropriate pumps to make vacuum. The CH4 molecules break upon impacting on an array of tungsten filaments heated to about 2000 ?C by passing a current though them as in the light bulbs. A unique outcome for this part of the project was the discovery that by coating the SS surface with an oxide film (only 30 nm thick), extensively used in the microelectronic industry, we were able to suppress diffusion of hydrogen, from the UNCD growth process, into the SS bulk, which make the metal brittle due to reaction of hydrogen atoms with SS atoms, which induced hydride formation that produce the brittleness, thus breaking of the metal. Therefore, UNCD can be grown on SS metal for LIBs cases, using the novel oxide interface layer to keep the SS metal flexible after coating with UNCD (see Fig. 3 attached in the outcomes section). A patent is being submitted.
Development of corrosion resistant metal membranes for Li-ion batteries coated with UNCD. The process involves coating with UNCD films flexible tungsten (W) membranes fabricated using photolithography and reactive ion etching (RIE) processes. The coating enables to close the opening of the W membrane holes to the appropriate dimensions for Li ions filtration. 


The novel N-UNCD-coated anodes  and cathodes, UNCD coated metal-based membranes and inner walls of battery cases (see Fig. 4 attached in the outcomes section) may enable the next generation of batteries with &ge; 10x longer life and much smaller dimensions than current LIBs and future TLSs.

This new Carbon Footprint Metric (CFM) system will mesh seamlessly with existing design and construction management tools that are widely used by architects, engineers and builders.  The system will provide dynamic, real-time, 'on the-fly' carbon footprint measurements, all the way from the building concept stage through to construction and building completion and operation.

The broader impacts of this research begin with the opportunity to help reduce the environmental footprint of buildings and the built environment, which currently produce about 50% of total U.S. GHG emissions.  A key element to changing behavior on the part of both building professionals and consumers are better environmental impact measurements. The availability of easily used yet rigorous and standardized tools for quantifying GHG metrics can dramatically change architectural and construction best practices.   Once validated for each class of building, the CFM system will permit architects and construction practitioners to evaluate and alter building design in order to reduce energy use and GHG emissions over the life cycle of the building.  Moreover, constructors can better evaluate construction methods and materials and building managers can exploit improved efficiencies to reduce GHGs. This will help the competitiveness and performance of the many small businesses that are among the pioneers in the ""green"" building industry.  The system could further serve as a platform for urban planners and environmental managers to evaluate and plan improvements in a given built environment which encompasses many buildings and building types.   The research and product development also have the potential to help transform the education and training of the next generation of architects, engineers, and product designers, who will be called upon to help build a more sustainable urban environment.


Partners at the inception of the project are Colorado State University, with participants from four Colleges (Agricultural Sciences, Health and Human Sciences, Engineering, and Natural Sciences), along with three small business partners: 1) Living Homes (Santa Monica, CA) that has as its mission the design and creation of homes and communities which set a standard for the positive impact on soil, water, energy and health;  2) The Neenan Company (Fort Collins, CO) that has as its mission the design and building of highly sustainable commercial buildings, schools, and hospitals; and 3) Nemetschek Vectorworks (Columbia, MD) that has as its mission the production of versatile, intuitive, and affordable Building Information Modeling (BIM) software for professional design solutions to the architecture, engineering, and construction industries.  Other partner: The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is a non-business partner that has as its mission research and development of alternative clean energy technology.   Supporting institutions, which are leaders in advancing a more sustainable built environment, include the following: the American Institute of Architects, the U.S. Green Building Council, the National Institute for Building Science, Architecture 2030, and the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI).",,,"We developed the CFM (Carbon Footprint Metric) software tool which integrates with the exiting computer-aided design tools that architects routinely use.  The CFM tool will allow architects and designers to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with a new building, during the conception and design phase, before it is built  The CFM tool is structured to quantify GHG emissions for the entire life-cycle of the building including calculations for the materials used in the building, emissions from the construction of the building, emissions associated with landscaping and the external environment, and with the operation and maintenance of the building.  Thus this technology will allow architects and builders to explore different design and materials options and get an immediate estimate of the impacts on energy consumption and GHG emissions for each option.  Since the built environment currently accounts for about one-half of all GHG emissions in the United States, improving the efficiency and environmental sustainability of our buildings is a crucial part of any strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The CFM tool is currently configured as a plug-in to the widely used Sketch-UpTM drawing and design tool and is suitable for use in designing residential and small to medium-sized commercial buildings.  To help support the development of the CFM tool we conducted detailed, on-site measurements of energy use and GHG emitting activities for two case-study building projects: a modular, low emission residential house and a moderate size university research laboratory.  Focus groups and surveys of architects were also conducted to assess their needs for and interest in software tools to improve their access to reliable sustainability metrics.  Three graduate students, one PhD and two MSc, were trained during the course of the project and the graduate students contributed much of the work that supported the development of the CFM tool.

The final goal is to demonstrate a major polytype of silicon carbide (4H-SiC) metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect-transistor (that is, a 4H-SiC MOSFET)-based operational amplifier, operating at 250?C or higher. 4H-SiC is a wide-band gap semiconductor with a high critical breakdown field, high thermal conductivity, good bulk electron mobility, high chemical inertness, and mechanical hardness. These properties make 4H-SiC an extremely attractive material for electronics operating in harsh environments and at temperatures higher than 250?C, conditions under which conventional silicon-based electronics are very inefficient. In addition, the ability of SiC to oxidize to silicon dioxide, an insulator, naturally makes for MOSFETs. MOSFETs are voltage controlled electronic switches that are preferred over other devices as they offer a great deal of flexibility for circuit design. An efficient 4H-SiC MOSFET-based integrated circuit (IC) technology operating at high temperature will have a positive socio-economic impact in a variety of industrial and military applications. A limitation for employing 4H-SiC MOSFETs for this purpose is the low mobility of electrons in the conducting channel. This is primarily associated with a high density of traps at the oxide-SiC interface that results in carrier trapping and reduction of channel mobility. Recently, the Auburn group has demonstrated an advanced interface passivation process by incorporating phosphorus at and near the oxide-4H-SiC interface. This process results in a significantly reduced trap densities compared to the industry standard processes and accordingly results in at least a factor of two higher electron channel mobility compared to the state-of-the-art. The higher mobility is expected to result in significantly superior SiC operational-amplifiers. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the transfer of a fundamental materials science discovery to advanced applications taking future commercialization issues into consideration.

The broader impacts of this research are increasing U.S. technological competitiveness, increasing the business viability of small business partners, and developing students capable of contributing to the semiconductor industry. A high performance 4H-SiC IC technology has the potential to open a variety of new applications areas and markets. Some notable application areas are sensing and control circuits for geothermal, automotive and aeronautical sectors. Such technologies will have significant positive impact on U.S. competitiveness. The increased innovation capacity of the small business partners resulting from the success of this program would set the stage for building commercial prototypes to penetrate niche markets, increasing their business viability, and thus a future role in the nascent silicon carbide semiconductor industry. The success of such a technology would also create new possibilities for other end-user application-oriented businesses. An important aspect of the program is related to the education of graduate students. Students involved in this project will be exposed to the ""food chain of semiconductor technology"", ranging from basic semiconductor materials science to technology development and applications during their master's or doctoral research. Hands-on training related to a wide range of scientific and engineering problems will result in the development of young, highly trained scientists for the U.S. semiconductor industry. Additionally, the program will include workshops for high school students and teachers. Finally, existing close interactions with Tuskegee University, a local historically black university will be consolidated in this program.

Such systems can be used for the speed control of electric motors in vehicles, industrial machinery or gigantic pipeline pumps, the regulation of volatile electric energy sources such as wind, solar and other variable renewable energies.

Commercial SiC technology made its baby steps at the turn of the century concentrating on power electronics. Since then, with the maturation of the material growth and process technology, other niche applications taking advantage of SiC?s resistance to heat, radiations and chemicals are now feasible. This opens the door for more complex devices than power switches such as signal amplifiers, microprocessors, oscillators, which would benefit from the physical properties of SiC cited above. The MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) technology and specially its variant CMOS (Complementary MOS) technology using Silicon are responsible for the explosion of electronics which brought about the digital age. The same can be harnessed using SiC, leading to future electronics for harsh ambient conditions. In addition to cost factors, there are various technical issues that need to be understood in detail, prior to seeing widespread adoption of such technology.

In this project we set out to transfer knowledge from University to industry (as well from the industry to the University) relevant to important technological issues related to the industrial manufacturing of SiC devices integrated circuits. The possibilities are endless but the choice was set on making an operational amplifier as these are ubiquitous devices used in many systems and offered a progression of difficulty from single transistors to multi stage amplifier working at high temperature. In the absence of an established CMOS technology for SiC a simpler NMOS technology was chosen. This blended well with the capacity of this group formed by 2 industrial concerns partnering with a University. The three entities involved were:

Coolcad inc.      producing software for the SiC industry as well as optical sensors, some      based on SiC. 
USCi is      a SiC power device manufacturer exploring an opportunity to grow its      business capabilities and diversify its products.
Auburn University with a long history of studying SiC MOS devices and for which this was an      opportunity to implement one of its latest discoveries and explore the      field of SiC integrated circuits.


Transistors (unit components of integrated circuits) of various size and shapes were fabricated following Auburn University?s processes. Their various device characteristics were measured, all this repeated at several temperatures ranging from ambient to 200oC. The transistors were then modeled and NMOS SiC op-amp circuits were simulated using Coolspice (a Coolcad Software). From this systematic study emerged a better understanding of the role of Sb in the surface counter doping of SiC MOS devices (an Auburn discovery). Coolcad then developed a design of integrated amplifiers that was fabricated at Auburn University. From this first implementation, a second design was developed with higher amplification gain. This second design was fabricated in a commercial foundry in an effort lead by USCi..Although the final device did not perform as expected, all three entities involved have acquired valuable knowledge about NMOS SiC IC processing and design, and have identified weak or missing links for establishing a robust SiC IC technology.

 

Part of this project involved reaching out to the community around Auburn University. In that regard there was an annual day long workshop termed ?Semiconductor day? involving middle and High School student of Auburn University neighborhood. Several schools were from small localities with little access to mainstream STEM facilities. During the semiconductor day these high School kids visit the Physics department, the semiconductor labs and talk to University professors and most of all Graduate students. They get to learn physics through fun experiments and immerse themselves into hands on activities in the semiconductor labs and get souvenirs in the guise of whatever they made. In an informal discussion with the University faculties and Graduate students they have the opportunity to present and talk about their own science projects and other STEM related activities and competitions. In addition, as a part of this project several formal research interactions between faculty at the Physics department in Auburn and that from Tuskegee University, a local historically black college and university (HBCU) were conducted during the duration of the project.

Probably the most significant outcome of the project is that Coolcad Inc is now working on an actual product prototype of integrated amplified UV detector for high temperature applications. Key findings from the PFI:BIC project have helped to initiate this undertaking. Currently with the support of US NASA. Auburn University and Coolcad Inc are developing a SiC CMOS technology which will address some of the technical difficulties encountered in this project which was n-MOS based.

These HWE derived bioproducts will replace similar products which are made from less sustainable and by less efficient means both in the U.S. and abroad. The wood fiber (and its constituent asset elements that will be the focus of this project) is currently primarily being burned for energy. In addition to the production advantages of HWE technology, the production of these products within the forested economic regions where industry needs them will reduce transportation costs and environmental impacts. 

The broader impacts of this project will accelerate the building of capacity and skill to strategically locate, engineer, design, fabricate equipment, and build facilities to efficiently and cost-effectively make products from existing raw materials; frequently on existing underutilized sites. Further, the partners will gain significant technical expertise and market advantage in understanding how to enhance the HWE process for these carbohydrate and chemical products.

            This project has four major research components, each with its relevant outcomes.  The first component resulted in the development of a Hot Water Extraction (HWE) followed by an Acetone, Water, and Oxygen (AWO) delignification procedure producing a high quality lignin for commercial applications.  The lignin does not have any added sulfur, making it preferable to currently available lignin from commercial processes.  This procedure was also demonstrated to be able to produce a substrate useful for laboratory production of Nano-Cellulose materials. The second component uses lignin recovered from HWE to produce resin that has competitive strength properties (98% of the tensile strength) with those of a widely used commercial Phenol Formaldehyde (PF) resin.  The resin produced in this work uses the recovered lignin mixed with furfural, which can also be recovered from HWE, and processing conditions comparable to those used for commercial PF resin.  The third component prepared Nano Fibrillated Cellulose (NFC) from softwood bleached pulp and Nano Crystalline Cellulose from HWE-AWO prepared material.  The NFC was shown to significantly increase the water retention value and to have significant effect on strength in tests of blends with a hydrophilic plastic (PVA).  The fourth component developed a potentially useful, at a commercial scale, process for producing furfural from the five carbon sugars (over 90% xylose) extracted during Hot Water Extraction of hardwood chips.  The process has selectivity over 80% (xylose to furfural) with conversion of over 95% of the xylose.  This work used pure xylose solutions and will need to be extended to mixed sugar mixtures to continue development of this novel process for commercial use in Biorefineries.  An additional outcome of this work is that initial funding ($3.5M) has been secured towards a $16M scale up facility to be built at a site in New York State.  This facility will scale up the HWO process and provide much larger samples for resin production and product testing of a wide range of intended Biorefinery products.  The facility is designed to be a continuous processing system with a capacity of 5+ Metric tons per day and involves the three Knowledge Enhancement Partners from this project.

Three target markets will be pursued: 1) development of processes to efficiently turn 'waste' heat into useful electricity; 2) finding new environmentally benign ways to deposit hard metal coatings on metal surfaces; and 3) developing improved 'ultracapacitors' (devices that store electrical energy and can be charged and discharged rapidly over millions of times).  Each application will utilize an IL, defined as a pure salt that is liquid around room temperature. ILs are relatively newly discovered compounds that have many unique properties not found in conventional liquids, such as virtually no vapor pressure, inherent electrical conductivity, high thermal stability, and large electrochemical windows. These properties will be exploited in this project to develop new products and processes that address large market needs. 

The broader impacts of this research are that it will address issues across multiple cross-sections of society that are of critical importance to the U.S. and world economy.  It will provide hands-on technology design and implementation opportunities in the area of ionic liquids.  In the long term, there will be opportunities to optimize candidate ionic liquids for several production-scale applications while at the same time reducing volume manufacturing costs. The project will allow two small, Innovation Park Notre Dame-based businesses to help South Bend, Indiana, a traditional Midwestern manufacturing city, re-invent itself. 

Partners at the inception of this project are the University of Notre Dame (lead institution, Notre Dame, IN). Small businesses: Echogen Power Systems Inc. (Akron, OH); Ionic Research Technologies LLC (South Bend, IN); Neo Industries LLC (Portage, IN). Large businesses: Maxwell Technologies, Inc.

Ionic liquids are a relatively new type of material that Notre Dame researchers have been studying on a fundamental level for many years. Ionic liquids are pure salts that, unlike table salt, are actually a liquid at room temperature. In this project, we wanted to take some of the fundamental knowledge that had been obtained from prior research and work with small companies to develop technologies that exploit the unique properties of ionic liquids, thereby creating new products and processes with commercial value.

 

The broader impacts of the project included the development of new technologies that could improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental pollution. The project was also designed to stimulate technology transfer between the academic team at Notre Dame and one or more small businesses based at Notre Dame?s Innovation Park research incubator. Such activities are essential to improving the economic prospects of South Bend, Indiana, which Newsweek magazine ranked number eight on its January 21, 2011 list of ""Dying Cities"".

 

During the course of the project, the team discovered that the greatest prospects of success involved the electrodeposition of chrome using ionic liquids, and so after down selecting to this technology, the team focused its efforts on this technical application. Electroplated chrome (Cr) coatings are essential for many industries, including automotive, aerospace, metal fabrication and electronics, due to their high corrosion resistance and hardness. Current methods for electroplating Cr utilize a hazardous and toxic form of chrome known as Cr(VI) (or ""hexavalent chromium"" or simply ""chrome 6""). European regulations (REACH) have established a sunset date of September, 2017 for Cr(VI), and so industry needs environmentally friendly alternatives for Cr plating. In this project, we demonstrated that ionic liquids could be used to enable Cr deposition on various metal surfaces using a much more benign form of Cr called Cr(IIII) (or trivalent chromium, of simply ""chrome 3""). The technology was developed jointly by Notre Dame researchers as part of this PFI project along with knowledge enhancing partners Neo Industries, LLC and Ionic Research Technologies (both based at Innovation Park). Joint IP was filed as a result of the work, and a new company was formed called Trion Coatings, LLC. Trion is a joint venture between Neo Industries and Ionic Liquid Solutions, LLC (the new name of Ionic Research Technologies). Trion now employs two PhD researchers and one business manager, and continues commercialization efforts of this technology. 

The figure included here shows a scanning electron microscopy image of Cr files deposited on brass (top two images) and zinc (lower two images) coated stainless steel. The ""trench"" etched out on the two rightmost images shows the thickness of the films to be about twenty microns thick.

AKI occurs in 5 - 7% of hospitalized patients and results in a mortality rate of about 50%. The financial costs of AKI are estimated to be 8 billion dollars per year, or about $130,000 per life-year saved. It is unlikely that this high mortality and associated cost will be reduced until there are better tools for the early diagnosis of renal injury. This project translates a quartz resonator based thermal biosensor concept into a biomedical instrumentation system for continuous monitoring of kidney function. The project will focus on prototype engineering, instrumentation, and extensive benchmarking with the aim to provide accurate and automated measurements of urine creatinine. Coupled with in-line urine flow, and periodic serum creatinine concentration measurements, a system for near-continuous creatinine clearance measurement in AKI patients will be developed. The unmatched stability, sensitivity, and reproducibility of this system will allow for collection of such data for clinical analysis and early detection of conditions such as sepsis. The sensor design based on enzyme immobilized alginate beads placed in a Kapton? tubing, as an easy to swap disposable cartridge represents a promising clinical diagnostic prototype demonstration with a viable business model.

This project will develop a calorimetric biosensor prototype based upon differential measurement as a way to compensate for background thermal effects. Development of a differential sensor is expected to improve both the sensitivity and the precision of measurement. The reproducibility, accuracy, and stability of the measurement system will be critically evaluated using urine samples. Intra-assay and inter-assay variability will be experimentally determined by repeated measurements and statistical methods. Accuracy will be determined by comparison of the creatinine concentrations determined by HPLC (the gold standard) and the quartz resonator. Agreement between the two methods will be determined by Bland-Altman analysis. Stability of the system will be determined by measuring the creatinine concentration of known creatinine test solutions at regular intervals over a period of 48 hours. The plot of measured concentration vs time will be used to determine the time to failure. In addition, personnel involved in this project, one graduate and one undergraduate student, will receive regulatory compliance experiences through collaboration with our partner company focused on improving patient outcomes through the successful implementation of innovative technology into medical devices.

The enzymes can be used in an aqueous solution that can be applied to food during cleaning and processing to remove biofilm-forming microbes. The use of a safe and green enzyme-based disinfectant is important because of the rising frequency of food-borne illness and associated outbreaks linked to microbial contamination from pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella. In addition, these enzymes offer an opportunity to replace harsh chemical cleaning agents with biocompatible, safe and green alternatives.??

This project will result in a?family of cleaning products formulated for a wide range of uses in cleaning of produce and other packaged foods. The uniqueness of the enzyme-based cleaning products are (1) ability to engineer specificity and target a broad range of microbial biofilms, (2) ability to select enzymes that retain activity under actual cleaning conditions, (3) ability to discriminate between pathogen and non-pathogen microbial biofilms, (4) demonstrated methods for high-yield production and (5) providing a safe, biocompatible alternative to current chemical cleaning agents. Collectively these features provide a new, green and targeted alternative to current industry standard chemical disinfectants such as peracetic acid in this market space. ?

This project addresses key gaps in knowledge required to translate this technology to the marketplace. Chemical disinfectants and mechanical disruption often have limited efficacy against microbial biofilms, allowing potential pathogens to persist in processing environments despite cleaning and cause foodborne illness. Furthemore, biofilm chemical structure is often complex and heterogeneous due to the presence of multiple microbes present within a biofilm community. This technology addresses both of these gaps by engineering enzymes that can degrade chemically heterogeneous biofilms, and can act synergistically with other cleaning methods or alone to enhance removal of microbial pathogens present during food processing. In particular, the project utilizes some leading industry partners such as Highland Fresh Technologies who will assist in designing and simulating actual process conditions under which application testing can be performed to determine amount per use and method of application. Also, production costs during scale-up will be calculated to identify critical costs associated with the final product. Additionally, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students working on this project will receive?technology translation expertise, working to answer critical questions necessary to identify production costs, business plan development as well as direct exposure to key industry partners to design and execute key testing of products.","Eckersley, Evan and Berger, Bryan W.~An engineered polysaccharide lyase to combat harmful algal blooms~Biochemical Engineering Journal~132~2018~~~10.1016/j.bej.2018.01.005~10061744~225 to 232~10061744~OSTI~26/06/2018 17:01:47.900000000, Wong, Sook and Eckersley, Evan L. and Berger, Bryan and Klauda, Jeffery B.~Probing the pH Effects on Sugar Binding to a Polysaccharide Lyase~The Journal of Physical Chemistry B~123~2019~~~10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b04672~10129814~7123 to 7136~10129814~OSTI~06/01/2020 21:01:49.900000000",,"The focus of this work was to pursue commercialization of enzymatic disinfectants to remove microbial contamination from packaged produce. Recent major outbreaks of E. coli linked to Romaine lettuce the past 3 years (2017-2019) have raised the visibility and importance of this topic in terms of food safety, as well as highlighted the many outstanding challenges that remain in addressing risks to food safety both pre- and post-harvest.

 

The major outcomes of this project were the development, benchmarking and commercialization of enzymatic disinfectants to eliminate microbial pathogens that contribute to pre- and post-harvest food spoilage as well as pose a major risk to human health. Specifically, we have (1) identified and developed multiple enzymatic disinfectants in the laboratory, including efficacy testing against a wide range of bacterial (E. coli, Salmonella, Listeria) and fungal (Botrytis, Aspergillus) pathogens (2) benchmarked efficacy in partnership with major food packagers and processers using actual pilot-scale processes and (3) successfully launched a start-up company (Lytos Technologies) to bring these technologies to market. Our first product we will bring to market is a green, organic biopesticide which outperforms chemical pesticides in field trials, with additional products targeting bacterial pathogens currently in development. At Lytos, we seek to empower growers with effective, organic alternatives to crop protection while ensuring consumers can enjoy products the way they were meant to be enjoyed: safe, green and chemical free.

 

The broader impacts of this work have led to job creation in the growing biotech industry in Charlottesville; Lytos currently employs multiple full-time scientists and technical staff, and is growing in terms of manufacturing and distribution. Wine is a major industry in Virginia, contributing over $1 Bil USD in revenue to the state annually; through direct engagement and partnerships with local wineries, we are supporting growers who seek green, organic alternatives to chemical pesticides. This grant has also provided valuable educational opportunities for students to learn customer discovery and business model development. In particularl Lytos is co-founded/led by a former student (Eckersley) that trained in the PIs (Berger) laboratory, as well as internship opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students to learn more about the start-up process and contribute to the growth and success of an early-stage biotech. The PI (Berger) has also integrated key concepts (manufacturing, customer discovery, business model development, product registration, scale-up, regulatory considerations, product life cycle) into the introduction to biotechnology course (CHE 2246) offered at UVA to educate students on how to pursue commercialization of biotechnologies.

Approximately 15 million bone fractures occur each year in the United States, of which an estimated 10-20% result in delayed or no healing (non-union) under normal conditions. If the bone fractures occur in complex trauma cases or in patients that are elderly or sick, this percentage rises to almost 50%.  Based on a conservative estimate, over $24 billion in additional medical care is required to treat these patients with poor healing. An underlying problem with treating fracture patients is that there are currently no standardized methods for accurately measuring healing. Physicians make decisions about treatment based on subjective physical examinations, patient's pain, and radiographic techniques (X-rays) that can only detect bone formation late in the healing process. Consequently, physicians typically wait 6-9 months to diagnose non-unions, at which point patients require reoperation. There exists a need for a quantitative, reliable method to monitor fracture healing and particularly to distinguish between the phases of early stage healing. This project will incorporate sensors into standard fracture plates that are used to surgically stabilize broken bones. The sensors will take electrical measurements related to the biology of the fracture and wirelessly transmit them to external monitors. Accurate monitoring of fracture healing using these smart fracture plates will inform clinical decisions of when to begin weight-bearing and enable earlier intervention of high-risk fractures, which together both improve patient quality of life and offer a substantial cost savings to the healthcare system. 

This project involves developing the electronic components to validate smart implant technology that quantifies tissue composition in the fracture callus based on electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).  Proof-of-concept studies have been completed in ex vivo and murine models of fracture repair; this project will scale the EIS technology into the rabbit model. Scaling-up to this larger pre-clinical model allows the project to address technology gaps related to development of the sensor and wireless detection system, while working with commercially available Orthopaedic implants. A key feature that will make the technology competitive is a custom algorithm designed to analyze and characterize electronic signatures to distinguish the various stages of fracture healing. Current competitors are focused on mechanical measurements. However, electrical measurements could provide a more sensitive tool to detect early changes, as the load bearing to load sharing transition (detected by strain gauges) occurs after hard callus begins to form only in the last stage of fracture healing.

The molecular artificial retina is important because over a million Americans suffer from advanced vision loss and this research has the potential to restore some level of vision in these patients, significantly improving quality of life. 

The project will confirm efficacy of the lead molecules based on ruthenium nanophotoswitches, evaluate their toxicity and optimize the scale up of the top candidates for pre-clinical and clinical trials of the molecular artificial retina. The nanophotoswitches (NPS) have the following unique features: it is a small molecule that is easily delivered (through injectable solutions or implants) to the eye, where it embeds in the membrane and ambient light activates neurons. The mechanism is universally applicable, both for any type of retinal degenerative disease and for any patient suffering from retinal degeneration. This is important, because many retinal degenerative diseases have multiple genetic components, making gene therapy complex and difficult. The class of molecules currently being investigated for a molecular artificial retina may be catalytic, therefore requiring only small, infrequent doses, and inexpensive, due to the simplicity of the system. These features provide the following advantages restoring vision with infrequent injections when compared to AREDs, a daily dose of vitamins that potentially delays the progression of the disease, the only FDA approved treatment in this market space.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial applications: Determine the biosafety of the lead NPS molecules and identify NPSs with low toxicity/ immunogenicity, evaluate therapeutic potential of the lead NPS, scale up the production of NPS to meet the market demand in quantity, and develop the polymer implant for sustained intraocular release of the NPS. In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate students and postdoctoral scholars, will receive entrepreneurship and pharmaceutical/drug development experiences through customer discovery and collaborations with ophthalmologists conducting pre-clinical and clinical trials.",,,"Some patients suffer blindness, because the light-sensing cells of the eye have been lost. With the aim to restore vision in these patients, we previously synthesized a class of light-activated molecules that we call nanophotoswitches or NPSs. As we reported, the NPSs can be applied to nerve cells and nerve tissue of the rat eyes to catch light, triggering the necessary cellular electrical activity needed for vision. Our hope is to commercialize this new technology, as there are no current treatments for certain types of vision loss.


In this NSF grant, we synthesized new candidate molecules for testing, and we examined whether the NPSs are toxic to eye tissue. At their active centers, the NPSs contain transition metals, some of which are known by themselves to be toxic. However, the transition metals in the NPSs are so tightly bound to other atoms that their toxicity may be alleviated. Indeed, when we injected the NPSs in the eyes of mice, we found no evidence of toxicity up to a month after the injection, based on a study of microscopic tissue sections. We are continuing to test for toxicity with more stringent tests, looking for evidence of more subtle cellular damage. Furthermore, we continue to test the newer candidate molecules for both their ability to trigger light-stimulated nerve cell activity and toxicity.

This technology will reduce the incidence of false identifications that can seriously impact the lives and families of innocent individuals.? The combination of new indicators, a cell phone enabled reader, and a dedicated analysis app is important because it improves the accuracy of the identification and limits the waste of public law enforcement resources. 

The project will result in a beta system consisting of a test, a reader, and an app suitable for deployment in volunteer departments. This low-cost, easy-to-use identification system has the advantages of improved accuracy, data management, and evidence preservation when compared to the leading competing?presumptive chemical?tests in this market space. It is also more cost effective than current field deployable instrumentation, which will facilitate wider adoption. 

This project addresses technology gaps in utility, scope and user safety as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The team has very preliminary data on the identification of illicit substances.  Although these results are promising, this data set must be improved.  By working with crime labs and academic forensic labs with access to these substances, as well as ""street"" drugs, the team will improve the quality of the substance identification database to make it an effective tool.  Critical to producing a useable database is the ability to identify a wide range of substances.  The current drug-indicator works best for compounds with cyclic amines like cocaine, PCP, and fentanyl.  Relatively simple amines such as methamphetamine, MDMA, JWH-synthetic cannabinoids, LSD, and DMT require a different indicator.  There are several candidates and the team will assess them while improving their dataset for scheduled substances that contain cyclic amines.  

There is also the possibility of unwanted exposure to the substance under test. The ability to identify a wide range of substances does not, in itself, reduce the exposure risk. Currently users must handle the unknown by applying a small sample onto a test strip. The team will work with volunteer departments to produce a new sampling device that will allow substance sampling with reduced exposure risk to the user.  

In addition, the post-doctoral scholar in this project will receive technology translation and managerial experiences through beta testing with volunteer law enforcement agencies and the direction of software development.	

The project engages IDem Systems to guide commercialization aspects and Softechnologies Corporation to improve the mobile app usability in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality. This effort will also rely on partnerships with crime labs in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Texas, Virginia, and California.",,,"The United States is in a decades-long battle against the abuse of illegal and controlled substances. Massive amounts of public funds and resources have been spent in this struggle.  Impacts are at the federal, state and local levels, at a time when public spending budgets are under extreme pressure. The results of this battle are not encouraging, with overdose deaths exceeding those from firearm and motor vehicles in every year since 2008.  Additionally, emerging substances of abuse such as fentanyl and its derivatives are increasing risk for public and governmental employees through casual contact.

            Methods for screening suspected controlled substances include the use of color tests, which when used properly and performed alongside other confirmatory testing methods can provide positive identification of suspected controlled substances. When applied in the field, by law enforcement personnel lacking the expertise and training to obtain consistent results, it could lead to false positives. This project and now continuing with the start-up IDem Systems, LLC produced a new method for identification of suspected controlled substances. This solution is a modernized system for law enforcement to identify drugs in the field.

            This effort produced a portable drug testing system that consists of a handheld fluorescence spectrometer and a mobile app with access to a reference database for drugs.  The final product of this project represents a significant improvement over traditional color test and a more cost-effective option compared to other solutions on the market.  Importantly, this effort developed a sampling system that significantly reduces the risk of contact for an individual performing such tests.  The low cost and improved safety will enable adoption by a larger number of law enforcement organizations. When commercialized, the system will provide law enforcement officers with a simple, accurate, adaptable, and affordable testing method for field drug identification.

            Legal actions based on flawed presumptive evidence as a consequence of false positive results from current field drug test kits wastes not only the time, effort and resources of law enforcement, but that of the judicial process as well. In addition, the impacts on the lives and families of innocent individuals caught up in this process are profound. Both law enforcement and the public need a field drug test system that is simple, rapid, accurate, definitive, safe and affordable, so that their enforcement efforts are efficient and effective.

In 2008, with the signing of the American Recovery Act, a $328M investment was made for the installation of high speed sensors called synchrophasors. These generalized power sensors provided, for the very first time, a system potentially capable of wide area situational awareness for the grid. By developing algorithms that interrogate these existing sensor arrays, combining them with real-time predictions of GICs in the power grid determined from real-time geomagnetic field data that is input to information on 3-D ground (crust and mantle) electrical conductivity structure obtained from the NSF EarthScope Magnetotelluric Program, a ""Smart Service System"" will be developed that will be capable of predicting impact severity on individual power grid transformers. This project will provide an important new tool for mitigating the impact of GICs on the power grid, improving the reliability of electric power service, potentially reducing the possibility of catastrophic blackouts, and reducing costs to power utilities and consumers by extending the service life of key components of the grid.

The NSF EarthScope Magnetotelluric Program has systematically measured the electromagnetic impedance of the ground at a temporary grid of stations that currently encompasses more than half of the continental US. The impedance, a frequency dependent tensor sensitive to the 3-D electrical conductivity structure of the Earth?s crust and mantle projects the ground magnetic fields into electric fields at that location. We will apply real-time streams of data from magnetic observatories to determine real-time magnetic fields at the sites of previously occupied EarthScope stations, and by projecting these through the impedance tensors and interpolating the predicted ground electric fields onto power transmission line paths, voltages that drive GICs in power grid transformers can be estimated in real-time and used as input to improved grid power flow simulations that will be developed under project support. This will be integrated with power flow information from mining synchrophasor sensor networks, and with satellite space weather data and NOAA geomagnetic activity forecasts.

There are 2 million Americans living with an amputation and the majority of those amputations are of the lower limbs. Although current powered prostheses can accommodate walking, and in some cases running, basic functions like walking on various non-rigid or dynamic terrains are requirements that have yet to be met. The goal of this project is to develop and test a smart powered ankle-foot prosthesis that supports increased mobility for real-life activities. This smart service system will be able to identify and adapt to dynamic walking environment. Based on on-board sensing and the activations of the amputee's residual muscles, it will adapt its characteristics to allow for walking among different environments (e.g. concrete, asphalt, grass, gravel, loose sand) providing robust walking and balance to the amputee. The benefits of the acquired scientific and technological understanding from this project can extend beyond prostheses, to machines that interact with humans in cases of assistance and rehabilitation. The partnership's multidisciplinary expertise including engineering design, controls and human factors engineering, provides a unique environment for training of the students involved, and fosters an innovation culture in the next generation of researchers. 

State-of-the-art lower limb prostheses provide reasonable solutions for walking over constant terrain; however, studies show that walking on variable and dynamic terrain may account for a very significant part of real-life functions. The ability to adapt performance at a level of intelligence seen in human walking is necessary to advance the current state-of-the art of lower limb prosthetic devices. This collaborative proposal aims to study the hierarchical processes contributing to the adaptive intelligence inherent in human walking, and to use that knowledge to develop a transformative state-of-the-art ankle-foot prosthesis. By analyzing the anticipatory and reactive mechanisms of the ankle dynamics when stepping on surfaces of different compliance, via the electromyographic signals of the involved lower limb muscles, this research is  expected to enhance the scientific understanding of the control of ankle dynamics. Moreover, by incorporating these principles into the design of a hierarchical controller for a smart ankle-foot prosthesis, this program will enhance the technological understanding of advanced powered ankle-foot prosthesis that enables adaptation to the environment, currently not possible by the state-of-the-art prostheses.","Yumbla, Emiliano Q and Obeng, Ruby A and Ward, Jeffrey and Sugar, Thomas and Artemiadis, Panagiotis~Anticipatory muscle responses in transitions from rigid to compliant surfaces: towards smart ankle-foot prostheses~IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics~~2019~~~~10098856~ ~10098856~OSTI~21/06/2019 23:43:21.933000000",,,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

One in eight people in America struggle with hunger. Food banks try to connect excess food to these families in need but face many challenges. The true need is uncertain; donated food has a limited shelf life; warehouse networks and receiving agencies have capacity constraints; and the donated food supply is unpredictable in timing, quantity, and quality. These challenges are becoming increasingly complex as food banks must distribute food equitably to those in need, efficiently maximize donated supply, minimize waste and distribute food in a cost effective manner. The existing tools used by food banks provide information to facilitate all levels of decision making but are limited in their ability to (i) provide a comprehensive picture; (ii) recommend improvements; and (iii) learn from and respond to the highly dynamic and uncertain environment. FEEED will synthesize data from various sources to automatically predict, visualize, learn from decision maker?s actions, and identify strategies to advance operational effectiveness of food collection, distribution, and resource management and fundamentally transform the way food banks operate.

FEEED advances the management of complex dynamic distribution systems that require intelligence to effectively utilize data to improve decision making. This research project will involve the exploration and development of: (1) a novel, stochastic modeling framework to adapt to the dynamically changing objectives of the human decision maker, thus enabling the system to learn over time and more effectively recommend solutions tailored to the decision maker's preferences; (2) an intelligent operational guidance engine and knowledge base that help food bank staff operationalize complex modeling into their daily processes; (3) a framework for synthesizing and managing big data in the humanitarian relief sector; and (4) human/machine communication modalities that facilitate user understanding and visualization of smart system analysis, predictions and recommendations. This research addresses the critical intersection of humanitarian relief, engineering, computer science and industry by linking donations management and food distribution to supply chain management and forges a relationship necessary to address this significant global challenge.

This project advances and integrates the investigators' novel concepts of operations and core algorithms into an intelligent UAS Traffic Management system (UTM). This UTM system would also break market feasibility barriers for new UAS applications such as urban on-demand air transportation and UAS cargo delivery. Finally, the insights gained during the development of the proposed UTM could have profound impact on design and implementation of other human-centered smart service systems and cyber-physical systems that support civil aviation, e.g., air traffic infrastructures, operator ground support systems, communication, navigation and surveillance devices, and vehicle technologies. 
This research proposes an intelligent UTM system integrating big data architecture and computation power that will coordinate pre-departure UAS flight plans, detect potential collisions in real time, generate recommendations to resolve potential conflictions, proactively control any risk to people and objects on the ground during an emergency landing, and identify the cause of collisions. The aim of these capabilities is to minimize the number of collisions and mitigate the impact of each accident. This will be achieved using large-scale optimization, aircraft guidance and control, predictive modeling, system verification and validation, and advanced visualization techniques for information presentation and decision support. The proposed system has a pre-departure flight plan coordination module that queries the approved flight plan database and performs conformance checking for every newly requested flight plan to achieve conflict-free pre-departure traffic coordination. An en route traffic monitoring and alerting module receives real-time aircraft position data and active flight plans, performs automated prediction for potential collision, and generate recommendations to resolve collisions. An emergency landing and contingency management module queries multiple databases such as terrain maps, obstacle data, airspace data, public safety data and real-time aircraft position data to suggest emergency landing site and calculate the corresponding landing path to minimize the impact risk to people and objects on the ground. Finally, the advanced human machine interface will provide information visualization and decision support in an intuitive way to reduce cognitive inefficiencies and maximize human-in-the-loop performance to augment UAS traffic controller capabilities. The proposed system will serve as a complementary component of an ongoing NASA UTM.

This is especially important in the aeronautics, automotive, medical, and space segments of the semiconductor industry because these products must achieve lifetimes well beyond those for which the technology used for their manufacturing was designed.  The reliability simulation software will lower the cost and time-to-market of high reliability semiconductor products by mitigating the risk of circuit failures of accelerated lifetime tests, which are performed immediately prior to releasing a product to market.  When a circuit fails accelerated lifetime tests, it must be re-designed and re-manufactured prior to release to the marketplace, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. 

This project will result in a minimum viable product, which is software for a lifetime check for semiconductor circuits.  This semiconductor reliability simulation technology has the following unique features:  the software works at the system level, covers both front-of-line and back-of-line wearout mechanisms, and can incorporate customer-defined use scenarios.  These features provide a more complete solution to the wearout simulation problem when compared with the leading competing reliability simulation software in the market space (covering only device-level aging incorporated in device models).

	This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The work incorporates three tasks, a comparison with standard industrial methodologies, calibration techniques for adjusting models to experimental data, and refinement of the simulation methodologies to enable scalability to large industrial designs.  Approaches include the use of accelerated tests for circuits, where test conditions are selected to isolate each wearout mechanism, so that failures due to a wide variety of wearout mechanisms can be observed, unlike industrial standard practice.  Scalability to large-scale designs will be demonstrated after development of methods to incorporate steps in the existing design flow and automation.  The goal is to demonstrate a reasonable computational cost and minimal impact on time-to-tapeout.  In addition, personnel involved in this project (Ph.D. students) will receive innovation/entrepreneurship/technology translation training through working with the project's business mentor, Jonathan Goldman.

Despite their potential, existing wearable devices are only able to measure a few parameters (e.g., heart rate, breathing, temperature or blood pressure). In parallel to these efforts, nanotechnology is enabling the development of miniature sensors that can detect different types of human health events at the nanoscale with unprecedented accuracy. In-vivo nanosensing systems, which can operate inside the human body in real time, have been proposed as a way to provide faster and more accurate disease diagnosis over traditional technologies. Despite the potential of this technology, there are several limitations in the current systems, such as the cost and bulkiness of existing portable systems, which limit its real-world impact. The objective of this project is to develop a smart service system for advanced health monitoring and disease diagnosis based on wearable nano-biosensing networks. The system consists of three elements: 1) a nanoplasmonic biochip, to be implanted under the skin and designed to react to lung cancer biomarkers; 2) a wearable smart band, integrated by nanophotonic devices for excitation and measurement of the implant; and 3) a software platform to process the measured signals, extract the information, and formulate a diagnosis. This technology will significantly boost the applications of wearable devices, by providing the means to detect different types of diseases and, in particular, cancer. By partnering with two industry leaders and pioneers in the fields of solid-state electronics and advanced biomedical devices, this project is expected to enable cancer progression monitoring systems, with a broad societal impact. Importantly, integrating research and industry with education is a priority in this interdisciplinary effort, which will train the next generation of student scientists (6 doctoral students supported). 

The project encompasses four intertwined research thrusts. The first thrust is focused on the development of the nanoplasmonic biosensing technology at the basis of this smart health system. This includes an implantable nanoplasmonic biochip composed of multiplexed sensor arrays for lung cancer detection from biomarkers in blood, as well as the optical nano-sources and nano-photodetectors needed to respectively excite and measure the biosensing signals through reflection, both integrated in a wearable device. The second thrust is focused on the development of the software algorithms to dynamically calibrate and operate the nano-sources, collect and post-process the measured signals at the nano-photodetectors by considering the intra-body wireless channel, extract the diagnose information and securely share the collected data with the healthcare provider. The third thrust is focused on the human factors that impact the design of the entire system, including the study of the impact and optimization of the nanoplasmonic biochip in biological tissues, the development of biochip regeneration techniques for continued operation of the implant, the investigation of the photothermal effects introduced by the nanophotonic excitation platform and the implant, and the processing and distribution of sensitive data related to the users' health. Finally, the fourth thrust will create an integrated testbed for the entire proposed system, involving in-vitro testing of the biochips with blood samples of lung cancer patients, ex-vivo testing with biochips implanted in tissue-equivalent phantoms with blood microcirculation networks, and testing in cadaver specimens.

The project is led by an interdisciplinary team of researchers at the University at Buffalo with participation of the Departments of Electrical Engineering, Chemical and Biomedical Engineering and Orthopedics. Two industry partners contribute and support the development of this project, Intel Labs (Hillsboro, Oregon, large business partner) and Garwood Medical Devices (Buffalo, NY, start-up partner).

DNA-modified collagen dressings are an important development because they will address two key shortcomings inhibiting success of existing treatments for chronic wound management - insufficient bioactivity/stability and high growth factor dosing - that lead to incomplete healing and serious side effects. This project will result in a proof-of-concept DNA-modified collagen dressing with the potential to fill a significant market need in advanced wound care, a growing segment in which the global market is projected to approach $15B by the year 2020. 

Specifically, the project uses a unique approach to create gel-based dressings employing collagen-mimetic ""peptide"" (CMP) molecules to integrate growth factor-encoding DNA into collagen gel ""scaffolds"" (CMPGs). This method for incorporating gene constructs into collagen scaffolds allows the gene constructs to remain localized and protected within the wound bed over extended time frames, yet as healing initiates, the gene constructs are released readily to stimulate further healing activity. Competing advanced wound dressings, which are largely based on collagen matrices or topical growth factor (PDGF-BB), have continued to show wound closure rates of ca. 50%, with concerns over growth factor toxicity. In contrast, the CMPG-based technology has shown (i) complete healing of 3D model wounds, requiring only 1/10 the growth factor necessary as compared with commercial approaches and (ii) sustained activity in a mouse wound model over periods of multiple weeks. These features indicating its definitive potential to offer patients improved wound healing with significantly fewer administrations, lower growth factor dosing, and fewer side effects.

The CMPG design strategy addresses several important technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Specifically, multiple reports delineate the clear synergies in wound repair between insoluble (matrix) and soluble signaling factors, suggesting that dual optimization of CMPG gene delivery and matrix composition is needed to maximize healing potential. At the same time, the matrix composition also has clear implications for clinical usage, as it will impact the ease with which CMPG gel solutions can be deployed, and the stability of the resulting gels after application. Hence, new intellectual merit will be generated by evaluating how nanostructure incorporation affects gel properties, and in turn, by elucidating how gel properties and cellular gene regulation can synergistically enhance tissue repair, leading to new materials and therapeutic strategies for a clinically difficult problem in chronic wound repair. 

The postdoctoral fellow involved in this project will receive training in intellectual property, regulatory issues, and market need through participation in formal University of Delaware courses (e.g. ""High Technology Entrepreneurship"") as well as short-courses (e.g. via SBE2 IGERT), which will afford a team well positioned to transition this technology into the commercial environment. 

The project engages?the University of Delaware's Office of Economic Innovation and Partnerships (OEIP), as well as partnerships with specific healthcare companies to enable further intellectual property development and large-scale market analysis, while also positioning the CMPG technology to fill specific needs in wound care technologies.","Palmese, LL and Thapa, RK and Sullivan, MO and Kiick, KL~Hybrid Hydrogels for Biomedical Applications~Current opinion in chemical engineering~~2019~~~10.1016/j.coche.2019.02010~10099514~ ~10099514~OSTI~26/06/2019 13:01:58.463000000, Thapa, Raj Kumar and Kiick, Kristi L. and Sullivan, Millicent O.~Encapsulation of collagen mimetic peptide-tethered vancomycin liposomes in collagen-based scaffolds for infection control in wounds~Acta Biomaterialia~103~2020~~~10.1016/j.actbio.2019.12.014~10147331~115 to 128~10147331~OSTI~30/04/2020 17:01:51.973000000, Thapa, Raj Kumar and Sullivan, Millicent O.~Gene delivery by peptide-assisted transport~Current Opinion in Biomedical Engineering~7~2018~~~10.1016/j.cobme.2018.10.002~10099511~71 to 82~10099511~OSTI~26/06/2019 13:01:59.746000000",,"We developed and new, injectable wound dressings and demonstrated that these wound dressings improve the rate and integrity of healing in preclinical, murine wound models. Our basic design strategy for these dressings involved the attachment of gene-encoding DNA nanoparticles to collagen-based gels by using a peptide tether called a collagen-mimetic peptide (CMP). CMPs are amino acid polymers whose composition is similar to native collagen molecules, and CMPs bind strongly and specifically to collagen. When CMPs are attached to DNA nanoparticles, they enable the nanoparticles to bind to collagen gels without falling off. Furthermore, binding DNA nanoparticles to collagen protects the DNA from degradation by enzymes in the human body. When collagen mimetic peptide and therapeutic gene-linked collagen dressings (COATs) are applied to wound sites, cells in the tissue surrounding the wound migrate into the COAT. These cells use enzymes to release the DNA nanoparticles, and the cells are then able to ?express? the genes encoded by the DNA to produce the therapeutic protein.

We had two primary objectives in this project. The first objective was to test whether the COATs could stimulate improved healing in murine wounds by delivering genes encoding the healing factor PDGF. The second objective was to create injectable formulations of the COATs that would fill the wound site, gel quickly, and remain intact within the wound following application.

Our results showed that the COATs stimulated PDGF expression by cells within the wound site. The amount of CMP peptide used within the COAT formulation could be changed to alter the duration over which the PDGF was produced by the cells. This spatiotemporal control over the production of PDGF (Fig. 1A), in turn, resulted in scarless healing of the murine wounds with faster rates of re-epithelialization and improved properties in the newly healed tissue (Fig. 1B) (Thapa et al., ACS Appl Bio Materials, in press). Moreover, using COATs reduced the necessary dose of PDGF to ~10% of the amount of PDGF required in topical PDGF formulations similar to those used clinically. The COAT formulations also demonstrated the ability to provide sustained release of the antibiotic vancomycin in a murine infected wound model, which reduced bacterial populations by 1000x as compared to controls. Antibiotic delivery was effective even against repeated inoculation of bacterial populations. The COAT hydrogel was more effective than topical solutions of vancomycin (Thapa et al., Acta Biomaterialia, 2020).

The intellectual merits of our work are the new understanding it provided regarding how gene expression can be controlled by incorporation DNA nanoparticles into a dressing, as well as how this new level of control over expression of healing factors results in improved healing in skin. Additionally, this project uncovered new information regarding how DNA nanoparticle incorporation affects the injectability, gelation, and durability in dressings such as COATs.

The broad impacts of these studies include important clinical consequences, in that the COATs would accelerate wound closure for diabetic patients, reduce side effects, and significantly reduce mortality rates. As topical creams and gels are a familiar therapy, clinical implementation should be facile.

This Accelerating Innovation Technology Translation project investigated the use of a smart biomaterial for the repair of cartilage. An estimated 49 million Americans suffer from cartilage damage as a result of injury, or wear and tear with aging. These lesions can significantly affect a person?s quality of life and can progress to widespread cartilage destruction and disabling arthritis. At present, current repair techniques are unable to restore a normal ""hyaline"" cartilaginous surface, resulting in fibrous ""scars"" that do not return the joint to normal function. The ElectroActive ScaffoldTM (EAS) has been developed, which is a synthetic material that has electromechanical properties similar to the native extracellular matrix (ECM) present during early cartilage development. Piezoelectric materials are capable of converting mechanical strain into electrical output and have largely been unexplored for cartilage repair. A previous prototype of the EAS, funded through a NSF research grant, consisted of a piezoelectric polyvinylidine fluoride copolymer (a biocompatible non-degradable material used commonly as sutures). However, through customer discovery from the NSF I-Corps Program (Award #1355718), we pivoted and realized the minimum viable product (MVP) as a biodegradable implant to avoid concerns about long-term biocompatibility. The outcomes of this grant were to fabricate a prototype scaffold for implantation and determine whether the degradable piezoelectric material can regenerate functional cartilage tissue over a 6-month period in vivo. We demonstrated that the implant was biocompatible and cartilage tissue formation occurred within the implant in a rabbit osteochondral defect model, demonstrating proof-of-concept in a small animal model.

 

Intellectual Merit

This project developed a bifunctional smart material for cartilage repair. Zinc oxide (ZnO), which possesses both piezoelectric and biological growth factor properties, was examined. A piezoelectric material acts as a highly sensitive mechanoelectrical transducer that generates charges in response to minute mechanical deformations. This scaffold can achieve a local electric field similar to the natural extracellular matrix observed during development and regeneration. This natural extracellular matrix is also rich in growth factors so the bifunctional property of zinc will provide a synergistic benefit to cells to promote repair. A flexible, piezoelectric fibrous composite scaffold consisting of ZnO and polycaprolactone (PCL) was fabricated into a prototype device and characterized. Proof of concept studies were performed in a rabbit osteochondral defect model demonstrating biocompatibility and cartilage tissue formation. Many individuals suffer from osteoarthritis or cartilage damage. Innovative technologies are needed.  This work integrates smart materials and regenerative medicine fields.

 

Broader Impacts

The proposed work had a significant impact on the fields of smart materials and tissue regeneration.  The research efforts and entrepreneurial and innovation activities were also disseminated in teaching, training, and education.  Of particular interest was the inclusion of underrepresented minorities and women in the scope of its impact.  The principal investigator?s laboratory was actively involved in the training of underrepresented minority and female students starting at the junior high school level through various community and university programs, with attention to underrepresented minority and female recruitment, training and mentorship.

Lignin is one of the world's most abundant biopolymers (second only to cellulose), but is unique because of its aromatic nature, giving it special properties. With the invention of the Aqueous Lignin Purification with Hot Acids (ALPHA) process, lignins with very low levels of impurities and of controlled molecular weight (i.e., ""ultra pure"") can now be recovered from biomass by-product streams, such as the black liquor from paper mills. These ultrapure lignins have the potential to replace petroleum-derived, nonrenewable polymers in a wide variety of applications, including foams, coatings, and carbon fibers. Today, the so-called Kraft lignins available on the market have over 100 times the metals content of ultrapure lignins (i.e., 10,000 vs 100 ppm), with little or no control of molecular weight.  In this project, ALPHA will be integrated with the Sequential Liquid-Lignin Recovery and Purification (SLRP) process of Lignin Enterprises to convert black liquor to Kraft lignin and then to ultrapure lignin.  Both processes use renewable aqueous acetic acid (SLRP as an acidification reagent and ALPHA as an extractive solvent) and both are continuous processes, so overall costs will be minimized compared to the current batch technologies.

This project addresses several technology gaps so as to translate ALPHA from discovery towards commercial application.  First, the fundamentals of the conversion of the hydrated liquid-liquid phase formed in the SLRP process to raw Kraft lignin via aqueous acetic acid needs to be better understood, so that operating conditions can be optimized for integration with ALPHA. Second, the liquid-liquid extraction, mixing-and-settling setup for the ALPHA prototype needs to be designed and constructed so as to obtain the desired purities and molecular weights of ultrapure lignin in 2-3 stages. Third, the technical difficulties of integrating the ALPHA prototype with the existing prototype SLRP unit need to be addressed, the final objective for this project being the production of 10-20 kg/day of ultrapure lignin from a typical softwood or hardwood black liquor. 

Undergraduate, graduate and post-doc students will receive experience in both technology translation and the successful start-up of a small company through their interaction with Lignin Enterprises.","Temples, Spencer C. and Gathmann, Sallye R. and Ding, Junhuan and Thies, Mark C.~Liquid?Liquid Equilibrium Compositions and Global Phase Behavior for Lignin?Acetone?Water Ternary at 25, 45, and 65 ?C~Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research~58~2019~~~10.1021/acs.iecr.9b03522~10179380~22619 to 22625~10179380~OSTI~01/08/2020 05:15:54.346000000",,,CLEMSON UNIVERSITY

This application is important because it allows the removal of carbon dioxide as it builds up in the air due to human respiration in enclosed spaces such as submarines, space cabins (International Space Station), and commercial airliners. The build-up of CO2 in these environments must be mitigated to avoid health issues such as cognitive impairment, drowsiness, increased heart rate, dizziness, and shortness of breath.  The principle innovation to be exploited in this work is the controlled and tunable synthesis of carbide-derived carbons (CDCs).  These porous materials have been found to act as efficient ""molecular sponges"", capable of ""soaking up"" toxic chemicals such as ammonia, formaldehyde, and other chemical agents.  The materials are also amenable to various chemical treatments such as acid/base washes and functionalization, which extends their applicability to a variety of target separations. 

CDCs have the potential for high impact in the air purification and gas separations fields, but there are major knowledge gaps in scale-up of the materials and integration at the device level, which are both essential for commercializing these materials. The researchers in this project will develop the methods necessary to scale-up the synthesis of carbide-derived carbons to the 20-gram scale.  The procedures for producing CDCs beyond simple lab scale are currently unknown and are expected to have a significant impact on the use of CDCs in industry. Further, the project will focus on the development of a prototype test bed, where the performance of a proof-of-concept adsorption cycle can be demonstrated. Ultimately, the project will provide the synthesis means and performance data to create an adsorption unit capable of controlling CO2 concentrations in confined spaces to specified levels (< 1000ppm). The expected output of this work will fall into three major categories: (i) materials scale-up procedures; (ii) prototype/test bed design and construction; (iii) demonstration of CO2 removal performance under realistic conditions.

This training will provide the student and postdoc with a unique experience that includes customer discovery practices and exposure to fast-paced research of a more applied nature. 

The project engages?NASA Johnson Space Center for testing of the prototype. Such device-level testing is too large for lab scale, but still too small to adapt for larger industry testing.  Thus, the NASA partners will provide a critical bridge across the performance gap to move this innovation from the lab to commercial scale.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Although the distributed sensemaking approach can be tremendously useful in accelerating a person's knowledge of a new domain and improving their decision-making, a fundamental barrier to this approach being adopted in the real world is that without enough initial users and the processing they provide, using the system is perceived as less valuable than just starting from scratch. This proposal aims to develop a new platform that will be useful to individuals themselves in managing complex searches, while simultaneously capturing the rich sensemaking they do while searching. In the short term, this platform will help people find, manage, and synthesize information for themselves from multiple web pages and for multiple tasks on a variety of devices ranging from smartphones to desktops.

This project conducted customer discovery interviews and surveys with several hundred potential users, and developed, deployed, and evaluated several iterations of platforms to support online sensemaking:


Bento, a novel iOS web browser which supported complex sensemaking on mobile devices. Bento solved the problem of tab overload by transforming search results pages into project-focused mutable workspaces which kept track of users? progress and notes. Deployment of Bento demonstrated a strong validation of its utility, but also challenges for sustained growth for a mobile-only solution.


Fuse, a desktop Chrome extension that enabled users to clip any type of information (e.g., snippets, images, videos, text) into a visually organized sidebar.  Similar to Bento, Fuse helps users not only collect but also organize information into projects and clusters. Deployment revealed strong evidence of use but a high learning curve and investment needed for perceived payoff. To reduce these costs and increase payoff, additional customer discovery with several dozen users led to the development of two new systems:


Meta, a system which cross-references a user?s open tabs to collate the mentions of items across those tabs (e.g., which are the most popular robot vacuums as mentioned by Wirecutter, CNET, Consumer Reports, etc.). Initial studies with Meta indicate that it reduces the costs for cross-referencing information across sources by more than 2-10x, and helps users more accurately judge the credibility of those sources.


Weaver, a system which helps people build personalized comparison tables by mining online reviews for user-driven criteria. Lab and deployment studies demonstrated that Weaver reduces costs for evidence-based decision making by 10x or more, with continue real-world usage.


Overall, this project has developed novel technology and explored product market fit for complex sensemaking platforms that can capture the work that people engage in every day and make it useful for others.  These results, culminating in the Meta and Weaver systems, illuminate a promising future for a revolutionary approach for how people will interact with online information and lay a foundation for a sustainable business capturing the value of these advances.

The project focuses on translating prior science and technology research that produced the first Intelligent Science Station, called EarthShake.  EarthShake is a mixed-reality educational game in which children discover physical properties of balance by running experiments with block towers on a simulated earthquake table. This project has the potential to have substantial societal, commercial and educational impacts. It aims to impact millions of children and families that spend time in Children's and Science Museums, libraries, schools, and indoor play spaces. It will transform traditional hands-on exhibits and play spaces into intelligent learning environments that foster children's curiosity and improve their learning in an engaging and collaborative way. It will also help to transform the traditional educational system in schools, introducing an interactive, engaging, mixed-reality system that can help students understand the underlying evidence for scientific principles, not just memorize them.  With over 270 Children's and Science Museums in the US alone, over 800 malls with play spaces for children, 100s of indoor play/learning spaces, over 4,000 clubs and after-school programs, 119,487 libraries, 36,767 private and charter elementary schools and 103,460 elementary schools, this project can have a commercial impact in addition to societal and educational benefit.

The system uses computer vision to follow children's progress and provide intelligent guidance in a predict-observe-explain scientific inquiry process. Experiments demonstrate that grades K to 3 children learn much more from EarthShake than from an otherwise identical flatscreen tablet or laptop implementation showing as much as a 5 times greater pre to post increase on tests of prediction, explanation, and stable tower building.  The initial prototype will be translated into a reusable platform for Intelligent Science Stations and demonstrated in scalable development of multiple instances of three games, EarthShake, RaceCars, and BalloonScale. The technical challenges are to generalize the vision algorithm to work across the variety of objects and configurations in these games and create modular hardware components that provide for scale in development, distribution, and new products. This project draws on technical expertise in computer vision/AI, mechatronics, tangible interfaces, physical computing, human/child-computer interaction, and educational technology.

Intelligent Science Stations bridge the advantages of physical and virtual worlds to improve children's science and inquiry learning in an enjoyable and collaborative way and can be commercialized to do so in various settings, indoor play spaces, museums, libraries, and schools. The project contributes to the general robotics challenge by creating an automated intelligent tutoring system operating in the physical 3D world, incorporating sensors and perceptual algorithms to track what learners are doing, actuators to manipulate the scientific apparatus, and an intelligent dialogue system to orchestrate interaction.  It addresses technical challenges of creating a generalizable vision algorithm and a modular physical hardware platform that allows customers to easily switch between different applications. It will create new knowledge about how to develop a general and reusable mixed-reality platform that integrates scientific apparatus including mechatronic components (e.g,. sensors, actuators, servo motors, physical experimental set-up) with an intelligent tracking system (including hardware and software components with an AI vision algorithm).","Yannier, Nesra and Hudson, Scott E. and Koedinger, Kenneth R.~Active Learning is About More Than Hands-On: A Mixed-Reality AI System to Support STEM Education~International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education~30~2020~~~10.1007/s40593-020-00194-3~10151045~74 to 96~10151045~OSTI~14/05/2020 17:01:52.600000000",,,CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY

RFB have advantages for electrical grid-scale energy storage options, including peak leveling and frequency regulation, which would reduce overall energy consumption when linked with an electrical grid. RFBs are inherently well-suited for large applications such as these because they scale more cost effectively (power and energy capacities are decoupled) than most battery technologies.

This project investigates non-aqueous RFBs containing organic electro-active species. This proposed type of RFB has the following unique features relative to other RFB designs: higher operating voltages, non-corrosive electrolytes, smaller size, and use of scalable organic active materials (more environmentally friendly and potentially lower cost). The potential customer benefit would stem from more affordable options for stationary energy storage, enabling a greater reliance on renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, and improving energy efficiency of the electric grid, which together can reduce the anthropogenic generation of carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel combustion.

Under this project, a prototype full-cell RFB with high concentrations of promising organic electro-active materials will be built and tested. To date, the lack of a demonstration of a high-concentration full cell has prevented an analysis of the performance and identification of the potential advantages and limitations of electro-active organic compounds. Moreover, performance-limiting factors associated with cell design or component failure are difficult to distinguish for active material decay. Full cell testing, at near practical conditions, is required to complete a thorough performance assessment. This project will address these knowledge gaps and complete the analytical suite through the following tasks: effective synthesis of electro-active organic materials will be performed at the requisite scale and purity for use in electrochemical systems, membranes will be screened and selected, a prototype will be fabricated, then high-concentration testing will be performed in a full cell prototype.

In addition to the technical plans described, the postdoctoral researcher supported by this program will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through accelerator programs at the University of Kentucky, such as the Entrepreneurs Bootcamp. The postdoctoral researcher will also be guided in customer interviews and continue work on defining key value propositions towards the creation of a commercial product. In addition, the project partners with MIT, and the MIT student on the project will work with the UK postdoctoral researcher and both will spend time at Argonne National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory for further training in flow cell design and characterization.

While materials stability and solubility are contributors to these metrics, the lack of suitable membranes for non-aqueous electrolytes limits both aspects of cell performance. Using soluble, stable materials, we sought to compare the best performance that could be achieved with commercially available separators and membranes. The incredible stability and solubility of these species enabled us to compare the performance of full cells without having to deconvolute capacity fade due to crossover and/or cell imbalance from materials degradation, because the latter was not observed. Here we report cycling metrics with a ceramic separator and an anion-selective membrane. Our findings show that non-selective separators are better for achieving stable performance versus time, but they suffer from low coulombic efficiencies due to cross-over during charge/discharge cycling. When an ion-selection membrane is utilized, coulombic efficiencies are high, but cells with separated negative and positive active materials electrolytes lose capacity as materials cross over with time; further, in cells containing pre-mixed electrolytes, although efficiencies remain high, capacity is lost due to cell imbalance, which can be recovered by electrolyte rebalancing. Through mid- and post-cycling electrolyte analysis, we confirmed that performance limitations are solely due to problems with crossover and/or imbalance and are not due to decomposition. The results of these studies highlight the severe limitations in cell performance that result from the lack of suitable membranes to pair with nonaqueous electrolytes.

This will reduce the costs of recipe development by over 65% and shorten time to market for the products of semiconductor tool and chip makers.  A single semiconductor chip requires over 50 etching steps. Each of these etch steps is a unique chemical process that requires specifications of an exact process condition or recipe (e.g., pressure, temperature, chemical ingredients and amounts, and time in the etch or deposition tool).   The underlying patent-pending methodology and software implementation for this project, Recipe Optimization for Deposition and Etching (RODEo), uses kinetic process models and statistical analysis to reduce the time and cost of process development by a factor of three as compared with current industrial standards.  Greater than $1.2B is spent on etch and deposition process development per year. This cost is projected to grow as new technologies and smaller features require new materials and greater numbers of etch and deposition steps. By reducing the number of experiments necessary to create a recipe by a factor of three, RODEo can reduce this by $800M.  

Development of plasma-based semiconductor processes is extremely costly and time consuming, severely slowing technology growth and constraining semiconductor equipment and chip sales. This project addresses this technology gap as it translates the RODEo methodology from research discovery toward commercial application.   RODEo uses Bayesian statistics to uniquely combine the physics-based models and experiments and the expert or so-called tribal knowledge of etch engineers to accelerate the process of recipe development.   Elements to be created for commercial translation of the research code include: 1) 3D profile simulator to couple with the existing plasma model; 2) Database of etch chemistry models and kinetic parameters for ease of use; 3) Optimized code for increased computational speed; 4) User interface; and 5) Industry demo of RODEo recipe development for sidewall control for etch of a high aspect ratio trench, against methods used by one of our industrial partners.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, including undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, will receive experiences in technology translation through interactions  and user feedback from our partners and future customers, which include Lam Research, Intel, and Tokyo Electron.

The chips in computers, tablets, and smart phones are manufactured over the course of hundreds of steps involving patterning, etch and deposition.  The recipes for etch and deposition are determined through costly and time consuming trial and error experimentation.  The microelectronics industry spends over $1.2 billion per year creating etch and deposition recipes.    The results of this project help reduce the time and cost this vital process.

To accelerate the identification of etch and deposition recipes, physics-based models of the processes are used to help guide the engineers by choosing the best experiments to quickly find the optimal recipes.  Computer programs were created that simulate etch and deposition processes.  Using these simulations and some initial experimental data, new experiments are suggested.  This cycle continues until the optimal recipe is determined.  Results of this study and other works indicate that this model based experimental design can be identify the optimal recipes three times faster and at one-third the cost compared to current methods.

The development of these materials is important because bio-based nylons with tunable chemical and mechanical properties are highly desired in the automotive and packaging industries. 

The project will result in a prototype polyamide material for which the desired properties will be introduced through the use of 3-hexenedioic acid (3HDA), a bio-derived unsaturated diacid monomer. This material has the following unique features: elevated modulus, impact strength, flexibility, increased solvent resistance, and tunable hydrophobicity. These features provide advantages such as a larger window of operation and access to new properties when compared to the leading polyamides in the market place.

Nylons are broadly used in the Automotive, Electrical and Electronics, Machinery, Consumer Goods, Packaging, Textiles, and Films and Coatings industries. In all these applications, polyamides are valued for their high strength, toughness, excellent wear properties and chemical resistance. However, dimensional stability is a major weakness of some nylons, because they easily absorb moisture from air, which results in reduction in tensile strength and stiffness while increasing elongation by acting as a plasticizer. For example, the Young?s modulus values for Nylon&#8209;6,6 and Nylon-6 decrease by about 40% with the absorption of 2% moisture. Nylons with longer monomers are less moisture-sensitive and find use in under-the-hood automotive applications. Conventional polyamides with longer chain consist in co-polymerizing hexamethylenediamine (HMDA) with azelaic acid (Nylon-6,9), sebacic acid (Nylon-6,10), and dodecanedioic acid (Nylon-6,12). However, the longer chain has undesired consequences on mechanical properties. For example, Nylon-6,12 has a lower Young?s modulus, higher elongation, lower strength, lower thermal distortion temperature, lower hardness, and lower melting point than Nylon-6,6 under dry conditions. Polyamides with longer chains present advantages over Nylon-6,6 only when water uptake is an issue. Therefore, there are unmet needs for moisture insensitive polyamides with similar or superior properties to (dry) Nylon-6,6.

This project investigated the introduction of biobased trans-3-hexenedioic acid (t3HDA) as a substitute to adipic acid in conventional Nylon-6,6 and its functionalization to access performance-advantaged Nylon with tailored functional properties. Specifically, this project focused on the synthesis of novel alkyl-modified t3HDA monomers, their copolymerization with adipic acid and HMDA, and the evaluation of the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of the synthesized polymers. We have demonstrated that the substitution of 5-20% of adipic acid by a novel alkyl-modified t3HDA monomer significantly reduces moisture absorption without compromising on any of Nylon-6,6?s desired properties.

In addition to advancing the synthesis and application of bioadvantaged chemicals, this project served as a platform to train graduate and undergraduate students in technology transfer, intellectual property, and entrepreneurship.

Usually, the cell tests are performed in a static culture dish, which is far from mimicking the physiological flow conditions in vivo. Besides high cost and long period for animal tests, one big challenge is that human cells might respond differently than animal cells, leading to clinical failure for many drugs that pass pre-clinical animal testing, in turn wasting a lot of time and money. Therefore, we have developed a novel bi-layer platform to evaluate drug carrier delivery in an inexpensive manner while still maintaining conditions presented within the human body.

 

The developed bio-mimetic blood vessel platform consists of an upper and lower microfluidic channel separated by a semi-permeable membrane. The channel design and dimensions can be tuned to match the specific blood vessel geometry, cell line, flow condition, and disease foci under study. ECs and pericytes/smooth muscle cells can be grown separately on the apical and basal side of the semi-permeable membrane. As a benchmark case, this biomimetic platform has been first used to study the influence of lipid nanoparticle surface coating on binding performance under various physiologically relevant shear conditions.

 

To further validate the application of this platform, we performed a benchmark study using inflammation/permeability as the pathological prototype. In this benchmark test, we cultured the endothelial cells in apical channel, which mimicked blood vessel, and cancer cell line in basal channel, which mimicked tumor tissue. This test demonstrates that exposure of endothelial cells to cancerous cells resulted in a compromised disease model of permeability/inflammation.  Subsequent administration of chemotherapy drugs, paclitaxel and doxorubicin, resulted in the death of cancerous cells within the model and the slow recovery of the EC monolayers.  This data verifies that the biomimetic system functions as a suitable platform for the analysis of therapeutic performance when considering cancer microenvironments.  The system as a whole allowed for successful quantification of drug/dye binding, uptake and transport in the controlled environment of a section of microvasculature.  Further toxicity data regarding therapeutic effect on both endothelial and cancer cells was made possible via the systems capability to allow for direct cell imaging. As an effort to better mimic the tumor microenvironment, which plays an essential role in drug resistance, an expedited tumor spheroids culture method was developed. By integrating this method to the current drug testing platform, the more reliable drug effect can be obtained.

 

To make it commercially more attractive, this platform was redesigned in order to allow for high throughput drug screening capabilities.  For this aim, a well plate based system was designed and fabricated using 3D printing technologies to produce a microfluidic system which consists of serval individual testing channels.  The well plate design of the prototype allowed for the use of the system with common plate reader units to allow for further therapeutic analysis optimization via automation of scanning and data collection.

 

Overall, a successful biomimetic drug test platform has been developed which can be used for therapeutic analysis under various disease models.  The expanded capabilities of the system for high throughput testing will allow such analysis capabilities to be realized on a larger scale needed for drug discovery applications. Besides scientific research, this project has provided research training for 3 PhD students and several undergraduate students.  In addition, the advances made possible with this funding have allowed for increased public awareness related to pharmaceutical testing through news reports, conferences, industrial collaborations and community events.

This is important because optical examination of pathological slides is a primary approach for disease diagnosis and peer consultations. Whole slide imaging that can capture the entire slide with high optical resolutions has been proven effective to advance an understanding of genetics, proteomics, genomics, and cellomics, which has greatly improved clinical outcomes. However, the prohibitive cost and limited availability of whole slide imaging (WSI) equipment have set a huge barrier for wide adoption of this technology. This project will address the unmet market need for affordable digital pathology equipment by developing a personal WSI device that allows pathologists to acquire and share pathological slides using their smartphones or tablet computers.

To do this, the project will translate prior research results on?an adaptive liquid lenses technology using a composite elastomer-liquid zoom lens with one single actuation unit, which will reduce the system dimension and process complexity of whole slide imaging. It can change the zoom ratio with only one actuation input without compromising the optical resolution and miniaturization nature of the adaptive imaging system. It also eliminates the need for displacing or replacing solid optical elements for changing the optical magnification. The project will result in a prototype of personal whole slide imaging device with a composite elastomer-liquid zoom lens. 

This personal whole slide imaging device has the following unique features: the two liquid lenses within the composite zoom lens can be actuated simultaneously and synchronously; only one actuation unit is needed for driving the composite zoom lens; and the dimension of the device is substantially smaller than the currently used imaging systems in digital pathology.?These features provide the advantages?of making digital pathology affordable, accessible and easy-to-operate when compared to the leading competing?digital pathology systems and other whole imaging devices using solid optical elements?in this market space.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery?toward commercial application. The use of composite elastomer-liquid zoom lens greatly simplifies the optical configuration and the overall size of the imaging system. This makes it possible to have the imaging device be portable and work smoothly with mobile personal devices (smartphones and tablets). To ensure that sufficient optical resolution can be reached, the thickness profiles of the vari-thickness elastomer membranes to be used in the liquid lenses will be investigated through iterative optomechanical simulation and experimental validation. This will generate new knowledge to advance the use of elastomer-liquid lenses for many high quality imaging applications. Besides the optical performance, the device also leverages the mobile devices' unparalleled capability of instant sharing for efficient transmission of whole slide pathological images. Given the prevalence of mobile devices, their increasing processing and transmission speeds, and the versatility of mobile apps, the personal whole slide imaging device with liquid lenses is expected to serve as a valuable solution of digital pathology for enhancing research and clinical outcomes.

The project will create ""Dibble,"" an innovative learning platform and mobile app that engages learners in the processes of scientific investigation (e.g., posing questions, exploring resources, collecting evidence to address questions, and making conclusions based on evidence). Dibble is grounded in the philosophy that scientific thinking, problem solving, and use of evidence are critical for our country's economic success and for our citizens to live healthy, participatory, and successful lives.  Dibble will engage users in the scientific process at multiple entry points, allowing participation through asking questions, collecting data, visualizing data, interpreting data, and soliciting ideas and feedback from peers, educators, and content experts. 

This project will take on key challenges related to sustaining user engagement; effectively supporting learners' creation and interpretation of shared data products; and identifying and creating intuitive and usable design features in learning environments. Dibble will seek the right balance between user-directed navigation- to ensure users are motivated and confident in their activity- and built-in features to guide and support engagement to support Dibble's underlying purpose of participation in scientific practices.

This project created a usable, visually appealing MVP (minimal viable product) app called ?Dibble.? Dibble is designed for a wide range of users including teachers, informal educators, organization leaders, and individuals. Dibble empowers users to create ?Projects? that use crowd-sourced data collection, analysis and collaboration to answer questions the users ask or solve problems they identify. Dibble is designed to be intuitive, engaging and adaptable to a variety of contexts and settings in support of the position that learning happens 24/7, in formal, informal and completely unstructured contexts.

A ?dibble? is a tool used in gardening to make space in the soil to plant seeds. The product Dibble, in the form of a web-based platform and app, aims to similarly plant the seeds of interest, empowerment, and critical thinking. It does so by supporting learners of all ages?in and out of school?in asking their own questions and collecting and visualizing data to answer those questions. It also facilitates educator-generated, peer-generated, and collaborator-generated discussions about the data and associated findings.

Dibble is designed to put learning in the hands of the users ? teachers, informal educators, organization leaders, and individuals ? as they create ?projects? that grow from their interests and ideas. While other crowd-sourcing apps focus on already-specified topics, Dibble empowers individuals to create data-driven projects of their own. While engaging with Dibble, users can come to understand that they have the agency to answer their own questions about the natural and manmade world, address issues of concern, and explore other topics of interest and places they care about in a way that can help them take action.

Intellectual Merit:
Whether young people use Dibble with facilitation from an adult, or older learners embrace Dibble on their own, it enables users to learn that collecting and analyzing data to answer questions is an important, systematic and often collaborative process. From a formal education perspective, Dibble can guide users through some of the practices of scientific investigation highlighted in the Next Generation Science Standards. In particular, asking questions that lend themselves to empirical investigation; planning and carrying out investigations (selecting appropriate variables and data sources); and obtaining, evaluating and communicating information through real-time analytics. From an informal education and unstructured education perspective, Dibble enables users to create investigations from beginning to end with a low barrier to entry. Dibble takes advantage of and contributes to the growing capabilities of digital technology, social networking, and mobile devices to explore new avenues for reaching learners of all ages. Dibble is now ready for research to further determine the extent to which it results in learning, brings about attitudinal shifts about the value of systematic data-based work, and supports social-emotional learning by facilitating collaboration and data-based discussions with others.

Broader Impacts:
Developing an understanding of the power of data collection and data-based conclusions is more important than ever. Dibble creates opportunities for users to see the value of systematic data collection and analysis as an essential part of their own critical thinking processes. Designed to appeal to learners with a variety of interests (not only science, for example), Dibble is flexible and can be used in formal, informal and unstructured learning settings.

In formal settings, Dibble will solve problems for educators who have to introduce several different tools to their learners so that those learners can create data-based projects, collect data and do analyses. Further, it will help the educators themselves, who have to use multiple tools to keep track of their learners? collaborations, engagement and findings. In informal settings, Dibble can be used by informal institution educators as a way to engage learners and potential visitors in learning inside and outside of their brick-and-mortar locations. In unstructured settings, Dibble can be used by organizations, clubs or individuals to collect data and generate products and findings to support their interests. With its flexibility, Dibble can bridge learning across settings 24/7.

 While existing apps are customized for specific Citizen Science topics and interest areas, Dibble is designed to be open-ended so that users can create projects that they are invested in and that engage others for collaborative work and a shared purpose. There are also apps that enable data visualization. However, these apps aren?t integrated with user-created projects. By making Dibble easy to use and accessible, we envision a time when, in the face of new questions or problems to solve, users will decide to ?Dibble it? by creating Dibble projects and engaging collaborators to achieve their objectives.

Achromatic focusing allows different wavelengths of light, for example red and blue, to be brought into focus at the same focal length, enabling a clearer image.  It is useful for a wide range of optics applications, from microscopy to photography to hyperspectral imaging.?Previous achromatic lenses have been limited in their wavelength range, whereas other broadband achromatic lenses use materials and production techniques that are expensive. The product to be developed in this project offers a combination of materials that are not only affordable but also production friendly, resulting in the fabrication of a relatively inexpensive optic with superior achromatic properties.

The light guiding properties of modern lenses are very advanced, making it possible to form images that are virtually free of aberrations. Such aberration-corrected lens systems are, however, optimized for a relatively narrow region of the optical spectrum. Beyond this range, characterized by optical wavelengths between 400 nm and 650 nm, the performance of most lens systems is significantly worse. Although this may not be a problem for taking regular photographs, it is a problem for a host of other imaging technologies, including optical microscopy, hyperspectral imaging and surveillance imaging, to name just a few. These technologies make use of regions of the spectrum that go much beyond what the human eye can see, thus requiring dedicated lens systems.

 

An important spectral region is the mid-infrared (MIR). Many molecular materials absorb light at characteristic wavelengths in this range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The MIR range can thus be used for identifying molecular compounds, a principle that is used extensively for material-selective spectroscopy and imaging. Designing an imaging system for the MIR part of the spectrum, however, often implies that the system cannot be used for visible wavelengths. This is because commercial lenses are not designed to handle both visible and MIR wavelengths. In many cases, a MIR lens simply does not transmit visible light, and vice versa. Even if the lens transmits all wavelengths from the visible to the MIR, it will not be able to focus the dissimilar wavelengths to the same focal spots. This latter phenomenon is known as chromatic aberration. There are currently no affordable lenses available that can from an image both in the visible and the MIR free of chromatic aberration. 

 

Given the exciting recent developments in MIR laser light sources and broadband detector technology, there is a need for lens systems that perform aberration free over an extended wavelength range, from the visible to the MIR. In this project, special lens systems were developed that enable achromatic imaging over this extended wavelength range. By selecting two common optical materials, namely calcium fluoride and sapphire, an achromatic optic was designed, fabricated and tested. The achromatic lenses showed the expected imaging performance, making it possible to carry out imaging applications with an unprecedented spectral bandwidth. When the lenses were implemented in a standard optical microscope, the imaging capabilities of the microscope could be expanded into the MIR region, thus opening up a wide range of new imaging applications. 

 

This new type of lenses has already attracted the attention of various optical engineers and developers. Researchers in the area of vibrational spectroscopy, MIR light generation and photothermal imaging are currently testing the broadband achromatic lenses for their respective applications. Given their unique imaging performance, it can be expected that several broadband imaging technologies will come to depend on these novel lens systems.

Fire suppression knowledge gaps can result in design conservatism that not only limits fire suppression system performance but also limits the overall building performance in form, function, and cost. 

The proposed platform provides an unprecedented capability to evaluate sprinkler performance by integrating recent discoveries in spray measurements and analysis with the increasingly popular Building Information Modeling (BIM) environment used by architects and engineers to coordinate a wide variety of design, engineering, construction, and even inspection activities.  Building Information Modeling is already used to communicate fire protection installation details and to evaluate hydraulic calculations ensuring water is delivered at sufficient pressure to the sprinkler head in the event of a fire. However, these models fall short of functional performance predictions of the actual spray dispersion and associated interactions with the built environment. The proposed BIM plugin would possess sufficient fidelity for performance-based design of sprinkler systems by providing the tools needed for rigorous analysis and system optimization. Distinct from the available computational fluid dynamics framework, integrating this spray analysis capability within the BIM framework opens a new world of dynamic functional analysis that is uniquely convenient, fast, and precise.  Further, implementation of this spray analysis capability on a popular, usable, convenient engineering platform such as BIM is expected to facilitate widespread stakeholder adoption, establishment of market viability, and exploration of the full spectrum of use cases. 

It should be noted that basic engineering questions regarding fire sprinkler systems remain unanswered even after 100 years of use. While new designs are routinely conceived, no predictive capability is available to answer essential questions of spray composition (i.e. what is the spray?) and dispersion (i.e. where does it go?), which impedes innovation. While the sprinkler spray pattern details (e.g. spatio-stochastic distributions of momentum, volume flux, and drop size) are known to govern fire suppression performance, the fidelity of the spray descriptions in the design process do not reach beyond global coverage area specifications for a given sprinkler type. In contrast, this proposed technology seeks to capture all of the spray details to completely describe its composition. Specifically, the proposed technology provides a complex spatio-stochastic initial spray representation, generated uniquely by each sprinkler model, captured by laser diagnostics, characterized in terms of a probabilistic analytical framework, and recorded into a sprinkler database.  This virtual spray representation is used to inform a novel computational efficient trajectory analysis integrated into the BIM framework to provide high fidelity super-real time predictions of spray patterns on building surfaces. These spray patterns provide useful information for sprinkler system designers to determine installation details for the suppression system.  

In addition to these technical advancements expected from this project, undergraduate and graduate students will receive valuable entrepreneurship and technology development experience working on a team consisting of engineers, computer scientists, university students, and faculty.

The new technology is called ""partial stroke piston pressurization (PSPP)"".  Hydraulic pumps and motors are often run at a small fraction of their maximum power, and they are typically very inefficient when run at that operating point.  PSPP is important because it saves energy at low power operation, which occurs frequently, thereby reducing global energy consumption.  Power will be saved in a large variety of applications where hydraulics are employed including: off-road vehicles (e.g., construction equipment), stationary equipment (e.g., hydraulic elevators and industrial presses), and aircraft (e.g., landing gear and wing articulation).  Furthermore, reduced power consumption by pumps and motors enables dramatic systems-level savings; for example, engines and cooling systems can also be down-sized.  The project will also have economic impact by expanding the domain of products where hydraulics provide optimal solutions; for example, PSPP pumps and motors may make hydraulic hybrid on-road vehicles competitive with electric hybrids, and they may facilitate the capture and storage of renewable energies, such as wind and wave energy.  

The project will result in a working prototype of a PSPP pump to be demonstrated on a skid-steer loader.  The pumps and motors developed in this project are unique in utilizing hydro-mechanical rotary valves to implement PSPP.

Second, efficiency will be further increased by applying a rigorous analysis-driven design methodology to optimize the valving systems.

The new technology is called ""partial stroke piston pressurization"", or PSPP.

Hydraulics offer the highest power density of any known motion control technology.  As a result, a myriad of applications utilize hydraulic pumps and motors.  Examples include: off-road vehicles, such as construction vehicles and farm implements, stationary equipment, such as hydraulic elevators and industrial presses, and aircraft, in particular landing gear and wing flap actuators.  The energy efficiency of hydraulic systems can be dramatically improved by utilizing ""variable displacement"" pumps and motors rather than ""fixed displacement"" pumps and motors.  The energy savings results from being able to match the power of the pump or motor to the power required by the load.  In contrast, fixed displacement devices are usually sized to meet the maximum load requirement.  When the actual load demand is less than the maximum, the remaining energy is wasted as unwanted heat.

Nevertheless, while substantial energy can be saved by employing variable displacement hydraulic devices, the efficiency of the variable displacement devices still decreases as their displacement is reduced.  PSPP devices utilize piston-style pumps or motors.  The efficiency at partial loads is improved in PSPP devices by applying high pressure to the pistons for only the portion of the stroke that is required to meet the load demand.  Removing pressure from the pistons for the remainder of the piston stroke reduces frictional and leakage losses.

Since variable displacement hydraulic pumps and motors are often run at a small fraction of their maximum power capability, the energy savings achievable through the adoption of PSPP pumps and motors is significant.  Approximately 3% of all power generated in the United States is used in hydraulic systems.  Therefore, improving their efficiency can have a significant impact on lowering global energy consumption.

The first major outcome of the project was to experimentally quantify the performance of the first prototype hydro-mechanical pump/motor ever constructed.  The desire to commercialize the new technology embodied by the first prototype constituted the motivation for this project.  The prototype was developed as a former project of the Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power (NSF Award EEC-0540834).

A PSPP pump/motor is an assemblage of two basic functional systems.  The first system is a mechanical mechanism which converts rotary motion of the shaft to cyclic motion of the pistons.  The second system is a hydraulic valve system that controls when hydraulic pressure is applied to the piston.  The second system is the system that implements PSPP (and is largely independent of the mechanical mechanism).

At maximum displacement, a PSPP device applies high hydraulic pressure to the pistons for nominally their entire stroke; e.g., the PSPP hydraulic system is not acting to reduce the displacement.  Therefore, the efficiency of a PSPP device at maximum displacement is indicative of the mechanical efficiency of the mechanism alone.  The efficiency of the base prototype at the maximum achievable displacement was about 80%, which is well below the design goal of higher than 95%.  However, the efficiency remained close to 80% down to about 40% displacement; e.g., the PSPP valving maintained close to the highest efficiency achieved for a large decrease in displacement.  The efficiency at 20% displacement was about 70%; e.g., at a reduction in displacement of 80%, the efficiency had only decreased by an additional 10% from the maximum achieved, validating the PSPP concept.

Testing results from the base prototype led to two inventions in the scope of the project.  The first invention addresses the problem of the low mechanical efficiency observed in the base prototype.  A novel rotary pump mechanism was conceived which has very high mechanical efficiency.  The second invention is an advancement on the PSPP valving concept which will enable achieving close to the theoretical maximum hydraulic efficiency for pumping regardless of the pressure or speed at which the pump is operated.  A new prototype that incorporates both inventions is under construction.

The technical developments were complemented by the development of a commercialization plan.  Larger, higher-end hydrostatic transmissions were identified as a promising initial market for PSPP pumps.

It is noted that competitive pump technologies have been conceived that achieve very high efficiency using the same basic concept as PSPP: applying high pressure to the piston for only a portion of their stroke.  However, the devices developed in the scope of this project are unique in utilizing hydro-mechanical rotary valves to implement PSPP; e.g., no electric controls nor mechanical cams are needed.  The PSPP technology developed in the scope of this project offers promising opportunities for realizing simple, durable, and highly efficient hydraulic systems.

Two potential applications have been identified: one as an underwater sealant, good for emergency water leak repair, and one as a controlled-release device, capable of multiple-month release of active small molecules for disinfectants, herbicides, fragrances, pheromones or drugs.  When used as an underwater sealant, the new material has the unique features of immediately sticking when pressed to a wet surface (rather than requiring a dry surface or a significant setting time), and could stop leaks faster than competing products. When used for long-term sustained release, the material also: (1) adheres to diverse surface types; (2) can be molded to fit most shapes; and (3) requires no organic solvents or high temperatures during production (which reduces toxicity and prevents payload degradation). This unique combination of properties could make this sustained release material safer and more versatile than the leading competing products. This project will result in prototypes that demonstrate how the new material can be used for both applications, and in a comprehensive set of guidelines for appropriately tailoring the material's adhesion, stability and long-term release properties.?

This project will address several knowledge and technology gaps as it translates the new multifunctional material?toward commercialization. To enable its successful use as an underwater sealant, the researchers will investigate: (1) how different modes of stress affect adhesive failure at various ionic strength, pH and temperature levels; (2) how rheological and adhesion properties evolve upon aging (and how these changes correlate to the structural rearrangements within the material); (3) how adhesion properties depend upon application method; and (4) how adhesion and rheological properties change upon drying. These analyses will both elucidate how and where the proposed material may be used as a sealant, and advance fundamental understanding of ionically crosslinked polyelectrolytes (from which the new material is formed). Further, to enable its commercial use as a long-term sustained release vehicle, this project will establish methods for optimizing this material to efficiently encapsulate small molecules (regardless of their affinity for the encapsulating polymer or their solubility), and will generate approaches for tuning their sustained release. By demonstrating how this ionic network can be tailored to deliver antimicrobial agents, herbicides and other actives over multiple months, this project will provide essential guidelines for the use of this material in commercial sustained-release applications.?

The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light is necessary to print the next generations of integrated circuits. The printing of the circuit pattern onto the wafer, known as lithography, is the single most critical and capital intensive part in the manufacturing of advanced integrated circuits. Advances in lithography have made possible the printing of progressively smaller features that have enabled the revolution in the information technology industry for the past 50 years.  The printing of smaller features has strongly depended on the use of progressively shorter wavelengths of light. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, a new projection lithography technique that uses a wavelength dramatically shorter than that of visible light, will make it possible to continue the progress in the fabrication of more powerful integrated circuits, sustaining the semiconductor industry's underlying business model, and the great societal impact that results from continued advances in information technology.  While the amount of average power generated with the current technology of EUV light is sufficient to initiate the high volume manufacturing of the next generation of integrated circuits, significantly higher average powers are still required for high wafer throughput and cost effective manufacturing. This project will result in the proof of concept of a technological innovation, the application of a novel laser pulse sequencer that makes it possible synthetize laser pulses of arbitrary temporal shape to increase the efficiency of EUV light generation by plasmas. Such increase in efficiency is of significant commercial value, because it decreases the cost of ownership as it enables the use of proportionally smaller lasers necessary in the production of integrated circuits.

The project addresses the need for higher average power and higher efficiency in the generation of EUV light for the printing of the next generations of integrated circuits. A prototype of a pulse sequencer will be engineered and will be used to optimize plasma conditions of electron temperature, density, plasma lifetime, and opacity for increased EUV light generation. The additional degrees of freedom in the plasma heating process is expected to lead to an increase in the efficiency of EUV light generation.

In addition, the personnel involved in the project will include graduate and undergraduate students who will be trained in innovation through immersion in the development of novel technology and its translation to industry. The project will in this way contribute to the training of a proficient workforce in EUV technology, an area of high economic impact in which there is a high demand for engineers and scientists. The project engages?ASML/Cymer. This partnership between an university and an industry leader enables this technology translation effort from research discovery towards commercialization reality.

After decades of development, the printing of the most advanced semiconductor circuits using Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography based on 13.5 nm wavelength light has entered high volume manufacturing (HVM) of integrated circuits , [i], [ii], [iii],.  However, additional increases in EUV power are still required to increase wafer throughput.  An increase in the conversion efficiency (CE) of laser energy into EUV radiation can reduce costs and increase throughput.  Here we report the results of the study of the EUV CE dependence of a tin on the laser pulse shape. The experiments were conducted by irradiating flat tin solid targets with pulses of different shapes generated by an innovative laser pulse synthesizer. Laser pulses of arbitrary temporal shape ranging from hundreds of picoseconds to several nanoseconds were generated using a programmable pulse synthesizer based on a diode-pumped chirped pulse amplification Yb: YAG laser. Measurements show that the CE favors the use of nearly square pulses of duration longer than 2 ns, in agreement with hydrodynamic/atomic physics simulations. A 35% increase in CEV was obtained when Q-switched pulses were substituted by square pulses of similar duration. Experiments conducted irradiating a solid tin target with a sequence of two time-delayed 250 ps pulses showed a 15 percent increase in the EUV yield respect to a single pulse of the same total energy when the pulse separation was optimum at 0.6 ns. This suggests that re-heating of the plasma with delayed laser pulses could be used to improve the EUV yield.  The spectroscopic characterization of EUV emission and in-band EUV images that characterize the source size are also presented.  The project also trained a Ph.D student who is now employed by the US semiconductor industry , and give research opportunities to other graduate and undergraduate students in a area of critical need with enormous economic impact.

As it translates research discovery?to commercial application, this project addresses the need for lower extremity exoskeletons with active ankle actuation.?The ankle joint plays a critical role in whole-body stability and forward propulsion during walking, yet no exoskeletons currently available on the market have ankle actuation or the stability and robustness required for independent and effective function at home and in the community. These limitations affect quality of life for individuals that rely on mobility assistance by hindering participation in daily activities and maintenance of physical fitness. In this project, a bio-inspired algorithm will be used to control active actuation at the ankle joints, in addition to actuation at the knee and hip joints, to explore leg coordination in standing balance, walking speed, and ambulation over complex terrain. The project will test whether the algorithm is sufficient for control of coordinated multi-joint movement, or alternatively whether reflex feedback control is also required.

Performance of the Ekso R&amp;D device with active ankle actuation was evaluated during standing and walking over level and incline terrain. The team at NAU, the muscle model was programmed in C for implementation in the Ekso GT exoskeleton. The team at Ekso Bionics modified the control system of the Ekso GT to accept third party algorithms. The code was debugged, stability analyses were conducted, and simulations confirmed that the model adapts to increased walking speed without requiring adjustment of the parameters. The team implemented the WFM control algorithm in the R&amp;D Ekso GT and debugged the errors. Motion capture was implemented to verify the WFM ankle controller. The team conducted tests with the R&amp;D Ekso GT at different speeds, over level ground and over incline with two unimpaired subjects. The tests were performed with the WFM controller and a reference controller. Unfortunately, due to low-level control problems with the ankle of the R&amp;D Ekso GT, the ankle joint did not track the WFM desired torque. Although we were unsuccessful in testing our algorithm in the Ekso GT, we plan to test the algorithm in a custom-built exoskeleton developed in the Lerner laboratory at Northern University in future work. The experience gained from this project will be invaluable in these future studies. One bioengineering doctoral student and one Hispanic undergraduate mechanical engineering major received training in algorithm development, validation and testing. Both students also attended national conferences to present the results of their work. The doctoral student obtained experience working in industry during two summer internships at Ekso Bionics Inc. The project contributed to one completed B.S. degree in mechanical engineering, and one ongoing Ph.D. degree in Bioengineering, and provided interdisciplinary research experiences for these students. The undergraduate student received a Goldwater Scholarship based in part on his participation in this project.

This technology aims to fill the need for faster and less ambiguous evaluation of battery materials during the quality control stage of battery manufacturing. The dispersed particle electrochemical device is important because it improves the speed and reliability of battery manufacturing quality control. Improvements in speed of quality control processes results in lower manufacturing costs, which translates to less expensive batteries. More reliable and robust quality control reduces uncertainty in performance and incidence of failure in battery products. Thus broader impacts of this proposal include both reducing the cost of batteries and reducing the incidence of battery failures, which in some cases result in major safety hazards including fire and injury. 

This project will result in a prototype that provides straightforward quantitative outputs for comparison between battery materials using a very fast method relative to the current state-of-the-art. This dispersed particle electrochemical device has the following unique features: fast electrochemical evaluation of battery electrode materials, further narrows tolerances for battery manufacturing, reduces ambiguity on the source of battery performance perturbations, and accelerates screening of candidate new materials. These features provide the following advantages: time savings of quality control analysis, improved battery product reliability, and faster evaluation of battery materials both in manufacturing and research environments. These features result in cost and safety improvements for finished battery cells at the consumer level. The dispersed particle electrochemical device, when compared to the leading competing battery cell fabrication and evaluation practice currently used in this application, is both orders of magnitude faster and is not misinterpreted due to contributions from other battery cell components in this market space.  
 
This project addresses the following technology gaps as part of its intellectual merit as the technology translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The technology has currently been demonstrated with a single battery material, and manufacturers have indicated that additional materials must be demonstrated to confirm the broad applicability of the technique. This project will also demonstrate the use of lower cost and nonflammable dispersion solvents which will make the technology more adaptable to a manufacturing environment. Similarly, part of the advancement to the prototype stage will include adapting to a flow-through device which will improve sample throughput and will be more amenable to manufacturing applications. Knowledge gaps related to commercialization including additional interviews with battery manufacturers to further understand quality control processes and needs, more detailed evaluation of existing intellectual property and necessary partners, and production of a travel prototype to demonstrate at customer facilities will also be addressed. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including faculty, post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduate students, will receive innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation experiences through working towards advancing the dispersed particle electrochemical device to the prototype stage and further working with battery manufacturers to adapt the technology to address their needs.","Geng, Linxiao and Foley, Sonia B. and Dong, Hongxu and Koenig, Jr., Gary M.~LiFePO <sub>4</sub> ?Accelerated Change in Surface and Electrochemical Properties in Aqueous Systems Induced by Mechanical Agitation~Energy Technology~7~2019~~~10.1002/ente.201801116~10094960~Article No. 1801116~10087441~OSTI~23/05/2019 13:01:51.926000000",,"The primary goal of this project was to advance a technology from proof-of-concept to prototype. This technology could improve the quality control processes and reliability of lithium-ion battery production. The technology works by measuring the electrochemical properties of the active materials used in lithium-ion batteries in a short timeframe, typically within a few minutes. Part of the intellectual merit of this project was to understand how generally applicable the technology was with regards to applying it to multiple different types of materials. The technology was successfully applied to provide fast characterization of multiple battery materials, including those currently used in electric vehicle applications. The use of aqueous carrier fluids was also incorporated into the device, which replaced the previous generation of the device which used flammable, toxic, and expensive organic fluids. This project better understood the fundamentals behind the technology being developed, and was able to demonstrate characterization of materials even when they were not necessarily stable in the carrier fluid for long time periods. This project also better analyzed the market and development options for the technology, and identified the barriers to successful commercialization of the technology. If successfully deployed, this technology would have the broader impact of improving the quality control and reliability of lithium-ion batteries. Improved quality control would result in lower manufacturing costs, which would to some extent be passed on to the consumer in lower costs for batteries and devices containing lithium-ion batteries. In addition, better quality control results in fewer recalls and product failures, which in the recall case improves consumer confidence and removes the stress of product recalls and in the failure case reduces the serious safety and personal injury and damage issues that occur when lithium-ion batteries fail.

These fibers, with robust mechanical properties, will solve needs for use in both the medical device field as sutures as well as a ballistic thread for applications such as body armor. However, traditional wet-spinning methodologies of rSSp have yet to yield a method of spinning that scales to industrial levels or results in fiber mechanical properties that match native spider silk fibers. This project will result in a proof-of-concept continuous electrospinning device that also has the ability to post-spin process the fibers, a critical component of spinning spider silk as the process is well documented to improve fiber mechanical ability.  

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) No device exists to continuously electrospin fibers and then post spin process them and 2) There is no method of spinning rSSp that results in fibers with mechanical properties mimetic to native spider silk that can scale to industrial levels. Specific knowledge gaps and methods of addressing them are: a) constructing the electrospinning device by modifying existing rotating-mandrel equipment to spin continuous yarns.  This will be accomplished by incorporating a rotating bell that will collect the electrospun fibers which can then be pulled away from the bell in a continuous fashion.  b) Incorporating a means by which to move the yarn outside of the device.  An arm will be engineered that will attach to the accumulated fibers from the bell?s surface and move that growing yarn outside the shielding.  c) Thread the yarn through a series of godets and stretch baths for processing which is traditionally done by hand threading.  d) Collecting the rSSp yarn on a collection spool.  At the end of the godet and stretch baths, the yarn will be accumulated on a standard spool that is in-synch with both the electrospinning rate and godets.   Producing the proof-of-concept device will allow the exploration of appropriate conditions for:  i) rSSp dope conditions, ii) electrospinning parameters such as voltage and needle distance and iii) stretch bath and stretch parameters of the rSSp yarn as well as rSSp:polymer blends. 

Personnel involved with this project will include undergraduate and graduate students who will not only perform the research but will also be involved in the technology translation and commercial aspects of the project such as patent pathways, customer discovery and licensing discussions.",,,"This Accelerating Innovation Technology Translation project involves continuously electrospinning recombinant spider silk proteins (rSSp) and their polymer blends on a proof-of-concept system that incorporates the ability to post-spin stretch the yarn.    There currently are no devices that combine the ability to continuously electrospin a yarn and further process that yarn.  The need to stretch rSSp fibers is well documented in the literature to promote their insolubility and markedly improve their mechanical abilities.

   A prototype system has been produced and the developpment and experimentation was included as part of a PhD dissertation.  This system involves the electrostatic deposition of rSSp and polymer blend onto a rotating bell.  Fibers are allowed to enclose the open end of the bell in a mat.  The center of the mat is then attached to a rod and pulled away from the bell as it continues to rotate.  Fibers are continuously deposited onto the bell opening as the mat is pulled away and twisted into a continuous yarn.  This twisted yarn can then be moved to godets for stretching and or bath systems to promote &beta;-sheet formation and alignment of those crystalline structures along the axis of the nanofibers twisted into a yarn.  The pace of yarn development is on the order of single meters per minute, which has proven problematic from a commercialization standpoint.

   Commercialization of this instrument system to spin rSSp and its polymer blends have been ongoing throughout the duration of the award and after its conclusion.  Unfortunately, this new prototype has not been met with the enthusiasm that we expected from industry primarily due to the speed of yarn development.  While this has not stopped our commercialization efforts, it has changed its direction.  We are now actively seeking an industrial partner to sponsor further research to increase the speed of yarn development and get our prototype to a level of production that is required to be adopted for full commercialization.

This digital enrichment system is important because animal husbandry, especially tasks related to animal welfare, take a great deal of caretaker time, money, and effort that can cause caretaker burnout. Contented animals are important to multiple industries: research animals undergo significant physiological and behavioral shifts under stress, which biases scientific studies; contented farm animals have increased immune function and need less medication; conservation breeding of endangered species depends on healthy breeding animals; and ease in pet keeping encourages the health benefits of pet ownership. 

The project will result in a manufacture ready prototype for use with parrots that has the following features: it will offer toys and food items on a preprogramed schedule, track and log bird behavior, and run interactive ""apps"" that provide rewards for cognitive thinking challenges, exercise, and natural behavior expression. Parrots are an unusual group of animals, as they exist simultaneously in endangered conservation breeding, pet ownership, commercial pet breeding, and research laboratories. This proposed digital enrichment system's ability to provide many different types of stimuli at a cost of ~$300 per unit provides many advantages?when compared to the $3,000-8,000 systems that exist the laboratory market and perform only limited husbandry tasks. There are basically no similar items in this primary market space, the companion bird market. Current state of the art in the market space for other species are items like monkey restraint chairs with levels and light panels, enriched poultry confinement cages (dust bath, perches, nest), and low functionality single species dog or cat products such as the iCPooch feeder.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery to commercial application. The complex actions and decisions made by positive reinforcement trainers must become a set of programmed instructions carried out by the app. The system requires specialized low processing power computer vision, and computer hearing that work in a variety of environments and for a variety of species. The technology must seamlessly integrate into the home of the animal, be low maintenance, replace person-hours of work, and be based on the best behavioral science.  These needs will be addressed by multidisciplinary teams of animal trainers, ornithologists, computer vision experts, computer programmers, and engineers working in the lab and aviary to create software and hardware combinations that overcome these technology gaps. The animal health and outcomes monitored will include immune function, body condition, bone density, and expression of natural behaviors. During development, the project will explore crossover applications for zoo and agricultural applications as appropriate. In addition, the project leaders will work with undergraduate and graduate students to provide them with hands-on experience working with industry partners and developing products for commercial applications.  

The project engages three important partners in this technology translation effort: The Schubot Exotic Bird Health Center (a research center with 150 publications on bird health), Hill Country Aviaries (housing and breeding about 2,000 birds of 60 species), and Chris Biro (a bird show owner who provides online training courses and engages several hundred thousand people in outreach annually). This team will provide the researchers with the environment for joint development, pilot testing, customer outreach, and guided commercialization to help transform this research discovery into commercial reality.",,,"-The problem of keeping animals healthy

There are good reasons to keep animals in captivity: pet owning benefits health; zoo animals help  teach the public to act to protect wild animals; laboratory animals lead to new medical treatments; and captive breeding can prevent extinction. These animals have many different needs, requiring special care from experts. It is often not possible to offer the best care because it costs too much to hire an expert.

Animals with poor welfare can be a big problem. For example, in endangered animal conservation programs, unhappy birds may not reproduce. Unhappy pets can have a depressing effect on their owners. Unhappy animals that are used for medical studies may produce bad data because they have non-normal body functions.

-Our solutions to the problem

We thought that a computer tablet could do things in place of a human trainer. We built a software ""app"" that uses sound and video-tracking to interact with the birds. The games can be set on a weekly schedule by the human user, and once the app is started, a prize dispenser connects to the app.

The functions of the game library included a vending machine and feeding software, two graphics-based movement games to encourage exercise, a video based game to get birds used to new and scary things, and a song-based game to encourage natural vocalizations.

We learned a lot about constructing safe equipment for animals that can crack thick-shelled nuts and break most kinds of equipment.

One of our experiments can help teach birds to trust new people, a common problem for wild animal species held in captivity. We used sixty-six rose-ringed parakeets, with two birds per cage. The birds were given one tablet for each cage. Groups of 22 birds each got a video. Two people videos, and one object video. In one of the groups that got a people video, a number of the birds attacked their cagemate when they saw scary new people! Before the birds saw their video person, six birds in four cages attacked their mate 24 times. After training, when they saw their video person, the trained birds attacked zero times. When they saw different person, three birds in three cages attacked their mate before and three birds attacked their mate in two cages after. Our data suggest that the difference in attack rates was meaningful. This evidence suggests that technology ""worked"" and we should do more studies.

For the second big experiment, we gave birds exercise games. Ten birds each had about four days to learn how to move the graphics on screen to get a prize. We recorded daily activity and found that the birds were good at winning games, even during their lowest activity time of day. One bird got an extra four days. That bird, during the extra days, tended to exercise more when the game was on than when it was off. However, birds who played the game for only four days did not increase their exercise when the game was on. While the birds could win the games, they may have needed more time to learn how to fully use the system. We learned birds could win an exercise game and interact with the graphics without being scared, as long as we introduced the graphics in a special sequence.

-What we learned from the project

We demonstrated that captive birds could interact with the individual software games. We were able to do several small experiments and two big experiments to better understand how the technology could interact with the birds. We could teach birds to accept a new person. We decreased the extreme behavior of cagemate attacking due to being scared by a new person. We saw that birds could win an exercise game, even when we made it difficult.

We learned what kind of equipment makes electronics safe for birds.  We learned how to make tablet holders for bird cages and how to make permanent tablet mounts to make a normal bird cage a ""smart cage.""  To control the tablets, we used both a wired system and a wireless system.

Having demonstrated that birds could use the other games by giving one or two birds a game and seeing if they could use it, we can now do future experiments using those games, similar to the two big experiments. We also hope to try the exercise game again with more time for the birds to learn.

It looks possible that automated systems, added to birds? home cages could safely improve their quality of life.

At 2:45pm, firefighters from Engine 33 storm into the basement of 298 Beacon St.  to find the source of the fire.  Only 4 minutes later, at 2:49pm, the mayday radio call comes through.  The firefighters in the basement are trapped by the fire with no way out.  They call for water to be turned on to the fire hoses they have pulled into the basement, but they are unaware that the fire has burned through them, and they are useless. At 3:10pm, the incident commander deems the fire too dangerous, calls for all firefighters to evacuate the building, and assume defensive firefighting procedures. At 3:15pm, 3:21pm, and 4:14pm, the fire dispatcher makes calls asking if all members have been accounted for. Even an hour after the incident commander ordered an evacuation, dispatch was not able to account for all firefighters at the fireground.  That day Boston Fire lost Lieutenant Edward Walsh and Firefighter Michael Kennedy. During  the  2014 Beacon  St.   fire,  despite  the  modern  equipment  and  dedicated  communication center Boston Fire has at its disposal, it took 38 minutes to complete a personal accountability report (PAR) check. A PAR check is essentially a headcount to find out if anyone is missing. Boston Fire normally does PAR checks every 20 minutes during a large incident, but that is impossible if the check itself takes almost double that time.

Over the last decade, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to commercialize indoor localization technology for emergency responders mainly due to a poor product-market fit. The  market and stakeholders need a solution that can streamline PAR checks so that they take less time, more quickly determine who needs help, and ultimately free up radio time to focus on firefighting efforts, not keeping track  of  firefighters. As  a  result,  the  need  quickly  emerged for  a  wearable  technology  with  two  main  functionalities:  (i) the  ability  to  accurately  localize  firefighters  inside  a  burning building to a quadrant and floor and (ii) provide a method for firefighters  to  quickly  complete  a  PAR  check,  reducing  radio traffic and overhead associated with PAR checks. This project is a result of the findings and conclusions of the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Team 735 (Customer Discovery for Field-Deployable Indoor Localization Technology), part of the Spring 2016 DC-area cohort and, it focuses on translating research discoveries on autonomous robot navigation to develop a localization and personal accountability report check technology to fill the need for a geolocation system with acceptable accuracy in GPS-denied environments.

These materials will be used?as part of easy-to-install and effective techniques to repair cracks in steel structures, specifically in transportation infrastructure. ? The?adoption of these SMA/FRP patches is important because there are nearly 170,000 steel bridges in the United States that may be susceptible to the formation of cracks under cyclic loading conditions such as due to traffic.??These bridges were constructed prior to the adoption of current fatigue design provisions. 

The project will result in a?proof-of-concept that the technology is effective for repairing the most troublesome types of cracks that form in steel bridges and will establish the most appropriate methods to prepare the surfaces of steel structures to install these new patches.?The?SMA/FRP patches are lightweight and can be easily installed without heavy equipment. They do not require welding, drilling or other irreversible modification of the structure, and they can potentially be designed to completely halt crack propagation.??These features allow for rapid installation, and longer projected fatigue lives while potentially eliminating the need to re-repair the same cracks. The need for subsequent repairs has been cited as one of the primary concerns with the currently most widely used techniques such as drilling crack-stop holes.?

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery?toward commercial application: (i) The current best practicing for installing composite patches is to grit-blast the surface to remove contaminants. Older steel structures typically contain lead paint and grit blasting poses an environmental risk that requires expensive protective measures. In this project, surface preparation techniques will be identified that do not present the same risks and the influence of surface preparation on bond behavior will be quantified. (ii) Preliminary testing has demonstrated that the SMA/FRP patches are effective at repairing one class of cracks, namely stress-induced cracks. The effectiveness of these patches to repair another class of cracks, namely distortion-induced cracks (which propagate based on a different mechanism),?will be evaluated. (iii) The long-term durability of the patches under out-door environmental exposure conditions will be quantified.

The enzymes can be used in an aqueous solution that can be applied to food during cleaning and processing to remove biofilm-forming microbes. The use of a safe and green enzyme-based disinfectant is important because of the rising frequency of food-borne illness and associated outbreaks linked to microbial contamination from pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella. In addition, these enzymes offer an opportunity to replace harsh chemical cleaning agents with biocompatible, safe and green alternatives.??

This project will result in a?family of cleaning products formulated for a wide range of uses in cleaning of produce and other packaged foods. The uniqueness of the enzyme-based cleaning products are (1) ability to engineer specificity and target a broad range of microbial biofilms, (2) ability to select enzymes that retain activity under actual cleaning conditions, (3) ability to discriminate between pathogen and non-pathogen microbial biofilms, (4) demonstrated methods for high-yield production and (5) providing a safe, biocompatible alternative to current chemical cleaning agents. Collectively these features provide a new, green and targeted alternative to current industry standard chemical disinfectants such as peracetic acid in this market space. ?

This project addresses key gaps in knowledge required to translate this technology to the marketplace. Chemical disinfectants and mechanical disruption often have limited efficacy against microbial biofilms, allowing potential pathogens to persist in processing environments despite cleaning and cause foodborne illness. Furthemore, biofilm chemical structure is often complex and heterogeneous due to the presence of multiple microbes present within a biofilm community. This technology addresses both of these gaps by engineering enzymes that can degrade chemically heterogeneous biofilms, and can act synergistically with other cleaning methods or alone to enhance removal of microbial pathogens present during food processing. In particular, the project utilizes some leading industry partners such as Highland Fresh Technologies who will assist in designing and simulating actual process conditions under which application testing can be performed to determine amount per use and method of application. Also, production costs during scale-up will be calculated to identify critical costs associated with the final product.

The miniaturization of passive electronic components is important because it will shrink the overall size and weight of wearable devices or allow more functionalities to be implemented without changing the footprint of the electronic components. The project will result in a prototype of an integrated circuit chip with rolled-up passive components, particularly an inductor. This rolled-up inductor has the following unique features:?small, light, and high operating frequency.?These features provide advantages?including better wearability and higher frequency mobile communications when compared to the leading competing?planar coil inductors?and other passive components in this market space. ?

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates the strain-induced self-rolled-up membrane (S-RuM) based passive components from research discovery toward commercial application. The current widely used lumped passive components, especially planar inductors in monolithic integrated circuits (ICs) have several drawbacks that include large on-wafer footprint (occupy as much as 90% of the IC), low operation frequency, and sensitivity to substrate doping levels and deformation. One of the solutions to solve these problems is to use three-dimensional (3D) structures, because hierarchical 3D structures enable efficient use of materials without changing the footprint in plane and lead to advanced functionalities that are otherwise out of reach. However, if conventional fabrication technologies are used to produce 3D structures, issues such as mechanical stability, conformity, alignment, process complexity and cost are difficult to address.?The S-RuM based passive technology provides a revolutionary platform because of the self-assembly nature, which produces a 3D cylindrical structure from a 2D layout spontaneously once released from the mechanical support, minimizing mechanical stability concerns by avoiding processing on suspended or curved surfaces. The CMOS-compatibility of the materials and processes also makes integration with active devices and other passive components feasible. In contrast to the planar counterpart, this 3D platform promises to produce IC chips with dramatically enhanced inductance density, superior Q factor/frequency, and minimized substrate coupling.

To reshore jobs, improve operations, and recruit, retain, and retrain skilled workers, companies are increasingly using robotics technology. Ideally, robots will not replace humans but team with them to improve productivity. However, most industrial robots are poorly integrated into human workflow, causing expensive work stoppage problems ($1.7M per hour), worker stress, and talent loss.  The research goal of this project is to address this problem by designing novel methods to improve human-robot workflow and productivity in assembly manufacturing through the use of an intelligent material delivery system (IMDS), which will closely integrate with and support the manual work process. This project will investigate innovative, multi-disciplinary approaches to this research area, dramatically advancing the state-of-the art in smart manufacturing and human-centered robotics. 

The research team will make the following contributions to human-centered smart service systems: 1) Revolutionize the use of robotics in assembly manufacturing processes to closely support skilled human workers, enabling them to focus on tasks they value (their trade) as opposed to tasks that distract from their talent (material movement). 2) Dramatically improve the productivity and flexibility of factories through nimble, real-time scheduling of an IMDS system that dynamically incorporates real-time models of human workflow. 3) Deeply explore the socio-technical implications of having an IMDS system in the workplace, in terms of human workers' cognition, fatigue, affect, and job satisfaction. The project's approach serves as a direct contrast to industry state-of-the-art, which relies on strict bifurcation of human and robot work, and rigid delivery schedules that fail to take local trim-line variations into account. By closely integrating an IMDS into the manual work process and understanding worker and material status, the project will readily enable flexibility and reconfigurability of a human workforce, an absolute necessity in made-to-order, small-batch manufacturing settings. 

This project will help the US manufacturing sector dramatically improve their operations by using automation to directly support a talented, skilled workforce. It has the potential to impact all major US manufacturing sectors, including automotive, construction, healthcare, energy, and goods. It will help US companies reshore operations, as well as create new opportunities for US worker STEM skill acquisition. Furthermore, this project involves a detailed investigation of multiple human worker implications of the transition from traditional to intelligent material delivery using robotics. By understanding reactions to such change, there will be new understanding on how to optimize a system not only for workflow and task efficiency but also for the human experience. Such knowledge is critical to maintaining job satisfaction, safety and health, and long-term well-being of the human workforce.

Flash hydrolysis (FH) is a subcritical water based hydrolysis process developed by the principal investigator (PI) which is used to extract proteins in aqueous fraction while keeping the lipids in solid fraction. FH process is conducted in a continuous flow process typically conducted at 280?C under subcritical water condition with a residence time of few seconds (e.g. 10 s). To generate enough feedstock for testing this process, about 160 L of algae slurry with 4-5 wt% solid concentration was been prepared. The cultivation and harvesting was accomplished through the sub-awardee Pancopia Inc. Hampton, VA.

There were three major engineering challenges of the proposed project. First challenge was to develop a rapid (e.g. 50-60?C/second) heating system that could heat microalgae slurry to the desired (e.g. 280?C) temperature inside the reactor within few seconds. A longer preheating or residence time will degrade the hydrolyzed protein. The team conducted simulation studies using COMSOL for modelling FH reactions and to understand the heat transfer issues at the mixing junction and inside the plug-flow reactor. Based on simulation studies for different scenario and commercial availability of a rapid heating system, the team designed, procured, and installed an induction heating system that could heat algae slurry to 300?C in 5 seconds. Second challenge was to develop a high-pressure pumping system for flowing slurry with high microalgae content (up to 10 wt%). The team selected, procured, and installed ?Lewa Ecoflow Diaphragm Metering Pump?. Third engineering challenge was to develop a customized back pressure regulator (BPR) which would be compatible for high solid/microalgae slurry. A domestic precision pressure control company is agreed to conduct a case study and develop a customized BPR. The entire mobile system was fabricated and built on a mobile trolley such that it can be used for demonstration purpose at different microalgae cultivation sites. A picture of 2.5 gal/h mobile unit is being uploaded with this report.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) for the FH process were completed and published in a peer-reviewed journal (ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering, 2018, 6 (3), pp 3580?3588). Four graduate students and four Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) participated in this project. These students were from multiple disciplines (Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering Technology, and Electrical Engineering Technology). Six high school students from the local community of Hampton Roads participated in four-week Biofuel Research Apprenticeship Program (B-RAP). One patent application was filed. Four peer-reviewed journals and six conference presentations were made to disseminate the outcomes of the scientific studies under this project.

The United States based startup company has sponsored a research project this year to test their proprietary microalgae strain through FH process. If successful, the startup company will go through technology transfer to commercialize this technology. Additionally, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has considerable interest in the FH process and has subcontracted a research project test their high-proteins microalgae strains. The PI has also reached to India?s largest petroleum refining company for technology transfer. One of the middle management employees of this company had visited our laboratory for the demonstration of the FH process.

This is applicable for occupational workers involved in physically demanding labor with awkward working postures, and who consequently suffer from work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). The translated technology is important because it enables practitioners to identify potential WMSD risks in advance of actual injury, thus minimizing the potential injury risks. Given the massive number of WMSD cases (e.g., over 360,000 cases per year) and huge associated workers' compensation costs (e.g., over $14.2 billion per year) in the U.S., this research contributes to the development and maintenance of a safe, healthy, and productive workforce, which will have an ameliorative impact on society. The project will result in a fully-functioning software prototype of vision-based ergonomic risk assessment, which has the following unique features: rapid (e.g., near real-time to process video frames), easy (e.g., no training to assess ergonomic risks is needed), and automated (e.g., no need for manual risk assessment). These features allow practitioners to save a significant amount of time and effort on ergonomic risk assessment, when compared to the current manual observation-based risk assessment in the ergonomic industry. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. First, a tracking-based pose estimation, which is a fundamental component to estimate posture severity, provides fast processing of video frames but needs to be robust without target loss, which can happen due to frequent occlusions and environmental noises in real worksites. In this research, the tracking-based approach will be integrated with a detection-based pose estimation along with the adoptions of different features like spatial information and reference frames from just processed ones. Once the prototype is developed, it will be tested in diverse real worksites such as manufacturing assembly lines to ensure its robustness and usability. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including graduate and undergraduate students, will receive entrepreneurship experience through interaction with ergonomic and business experts and potential customers (e.g., customer interaction, market study, and field validation) as well as engagement in the activities offered from the University of Michigan Center for Entrepreneurship (e.g., entrepreneurship classes and workshops). 

The project engages Humantech, the largest ergonomic consulting firm in North America, UAW (United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement workers of America), and a venture capitalist, to provide real-world test environment and guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research findings toward commercial reality.","Golabchi, Alireza and Guo, Xingzhou and Liu, Meiyin and Han, SangUk and Lee, SangHyun and AbouRizk, Simaan~An integrated ergonomics framework for evaluation and design of construction operations~Automation in Construction~95~2018~~~10.1016/j.autcon.2018.08.003~10076234~72 to 85~10076234~OSTI~27/09/2018 17:01:45.416000000",,"Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) are prevalent in many industries, including manufacturing, where workers are routinely exposed to physically demanding tasks, awkward postures, and repetitive manual handling movements. In 2017, U.S. industries recorded a total of 282,750 WMSDs, accounting for more than 32% of all non-fatal occupational injuries (BLS 2017a; BLS 2017b). Various ergonomic risk assessment tools (e.g., Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA)) have been widely applied to identify the underlying risks of the WMSDs at job sites. Despite their prevalence, these tools heavily rely on manual observations, which makes them time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone.

To address these challenges, this research developed a fully functioning prototype, a smartphone-based ergonomic risk assessment system that does not require the attachment of sensors/markers to workers. Comprehensive tests, both in a laboratory and real workplaces, have been conducted, which demonstrates that the developed prototype can greatly improve an on-site ergonomic risk assessment process. All the tests showed that itis much faster and more accurate than manual observation in evaluating ergonomic risk factors. As a result, the successful commercialization and deployment of this prototype software allows ergonomic practitioners to identify ergonomic risks in a timely and affordable manner, providing a firm foundation to reduce and prevent WMSDs. Furthermore, it can also be extended to other industries where WMSDs are prevalent, such as transportation and warehousing, health care, and construction. Preventing WMSDs will greatly increase the safety, health, and productivity of the workforce.

In an effort to commercialize, Kinetica LLC, a start-up company, has been formed, and a successful partnership has been made with one of the largest ergonomics consulting firms in North America. Additional partnership opportunities have been actively discussed with a number of companies including ergonomic service providers, insurance companies and manufacturing plants. In this journey, several graduate and undergraduate students have actively participated in this project, learning the necessary knowledge and skills to grow into innovative entrepreneurs.

This new holographic switch is important because today's data centers consume 5% of the United States' electrical production and their power requirements are increasing exponentially as major companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon construct multi-acre data centers to satisfy consumer demand. The worldwide Internet traffic is forecasted to continue its rapid growth; doubling every 18 months due to new applications such as the Internet of Things.  Unless a disruptive technology can be implemented, data centers' energy consumption will continue to grow at an exponential rate. The proposed holographic optical switch will enable new data center architectures that can dramatically reduce energy consumption while improving performance.  

The project will result in a prototype holographic optical switch and characterization of its performance in data center applications. This holographic switch has the following unique features: very low electrical power consumption, support for data rates to at least 1 Terrabit / second, and a flexible design that can provide a large number of input and output ports.  These features provide advantages in term of energy efficiency, scalability, throughput, and data center architecture flexibility when compared to the existing electrical top-of-the-rack switches in the market space.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial applications.  Commercial hybrid switching technology suffers from limited port count (~300 ports), long configuration time (10s of milliseconds) and high cost ($300/port). The proposal implements a switch based on integrating a novel holographic technique with a piston MOEMS (micro opto electro mechanical system) system.  Our proposed system will overcome the limitations of the incumbent technology with the holographic switch which will provide high port count (10,000 ports), microsecond switching times (two orders of magnitude improvement), dramatically reduced cost per port (<$10/port), enabling a 6? reduction in data center power consumption. 

The graduate students involved in this project will receive entrepreneurship training through seminars and lectures based upon the ""Lean Startup"" methodology described in ""The Startup Owner's Manual"" by Steven Blank.  The students will also have direct interactions with industry through the CIAN ERC's Industrial Advisory Board.

The project combines the holographic switching technology developed at U. Arizona with the Si-based piston MOEMS technology developed at UC Berkeley.

This power consumption is increasing at the same rate as the IP traffic which is exponential. The industry sector is very well aware of this unsustainable trend, and new innovations are constantly funneled from the laboratory into the real world to curb this progression. Among the most power hungry equipment of data centers are the electronic switches that redirect the signal from server to server. The goal this project was to dramatically improve the efficiency of circuit switching in data centers by developing a holographic optical switch to replace the highly inefficient electronic switches.
During the course of this program we developed two generations of holographic chip able to steer optical beams from fiber to fiber. The first generation of chip was based on piton motion of micro-mirror and, although we succeeded to demonstrate a functional prototype, it was discovered that the actuator for the piston mechanism was too bulky to realize an effective design. Learning from this experience, our second chip generation used a unique shifting technique that allows for smaller and faster pixel elements, improving the switch characteristics. The chip has been packaged both mechanically and electrically and has been tested for performance in the optical switch configuration. 
The performance of the holographic optical switch based on the shifting pixel chip are matching or exceeding the expectation of the program with a resonance frequency (reconfiguration speed) of 55kHz, a diffraction efficiency above 90%, and a filed of view (diffraction angle) of 6.6??4.4? at 1550nm wavelength (c-band telecommunication).
This research program has helped to train 2 Ph.D. students, 1 master students, and 10 undergraduate students in engineering in the field of telecommunication, and photonics. Among these students, priority was given to female and underrepresented minorities.
The results of this research program have been disseminated through multiple scientific publications. The IP generated during the program has been secured by the application of two patents. Both patents have been licensed to a start-up company that is now developing the holographic optical switch prototype into a commercial product.

UF and NF membranes are used in a variety of commercial applications. UF is widely employed in food and bioprocessing, for filtration in cheese processing, and pathogen removal from milk, for example. NF membranes are deployed in the removal of organic contaminants for purification of industrially produced wastewaters, for example in textile and paper-making. NF is also employed in point-of-use water purification in households for water softening. Both UF and NF are also employed for the removal of particulate materials in the preparation of high quality water in the microelectronics industry. Improved UF and NF membranes are expected to have positive impacts on the aforementioned applications. 

This project is focused specifically on filtration for the microelectronics industry and will result in the development of scalable manufacturing methods, prototype membranes, and the provision of critical membrane performance data for this application. The new self-assembled NF and UF membranes targeted in this project will feature a narrower distribution of pore sizes and reduced tortuosity relative to current state of the art NF membranes. They are expected to provide greater selectivity, and therefore improved separation efficiency in critical applications such as microelectronics filtration, relative to the existing state of the art NF membranes. 

This project addresses the scalable fabrication technology gap that must be overcome to translate from research discovery toward commercial application. Two distinct approaches will be pursued. The first is centered on the use of physical confinement to vertically align nanopores in membranes derived by crosslinking self-assembled small molecules. The second is based on the use of magnetic fields, and in particular, low intensity magnetic fields, to vertically align self-assembled polymer nanostructures. These nanostructures are thereafter etched and the resulting pores are used for filtration. In both cases, a critically important aspect is the need to develop processing methods that enable fabrication on appropriate microporous films for mechanical support of the membranes. 

The project engages Pall Corporation as an industrial partner to provide application-relevant test data and feedback on commercial opportunities in the overall translation effort. Graduate students involved with this project will receive technology translation and entrepreneurship experiences through collaboration with the industrial partner and participation in career development activities with university technology transfer offices.",,,"Water purification by nanofiltration (NF) represents a critically important endeavor in the contexts of securing human health and providing an important resource that underpins a significant amount of economic activity. The performance of current NF membranes is limited by a lack of selectivity, and a general trade-off between selectivity and permeability. Self-assembled materials are in principle attractive for developing new NF membranes as they circumvent the limitations of pathway tortuosity and size-dispersity found in the transport-regulating features of conventional membranes. However the need to align the discrete nanostructures in these systems (such as cylinders and lamellae), and the narrow windows of stability for bicontinuous structures present challenges, as does preservation of nanostructure during processing to form robust membranes.  This project addresses the above critical limitations.

 

This project resulted in the following achievements: (1) successful demonstration of a surface-induced alignment method for controlling the orientation of self-assembled structures, and the fabrication of nanofiltration membranes based on such an approach; (2) a demonstration of a novel technique for controlling the thickness of membranes during fabrication, as required for high performance operations; (3) the discovery that high performance nanofiltration membranes with high selectivity and permeability may be realized in suitably optimized self-assembled materials without alignment control. The project has thus developed new knowledge regarding the formulation, fabrication and performance of nanofiltration membranes from self-assembled materials. The materials and methods developed in this project could form the basis for commercial production of new NF membranes in the near future.

The technology focuses on the development of an enzyme based electro-chemical biosensor for highly selective, ultra-low level detection of volatile markers released by plants during pathogen infections. Currently used methods for disease detection in agricultural crops are time consuming, destructive, demand skilled analysts, and do not offer real time monitoring or on-field deployment possibilities. A rapid, real-time, non-destructive, ex-situ method for early detection of infections will help crop producers to locate and contain the infection, prevent the spread of disease, spray chemicals selectively and timely and hence avoid colossal crop damage. The proposed technology could fundamentally transform the approach towards disease management and precision agriculture.

The goal was to be able to predict the onset of mass infections before such outbreaks cause signficiant damage. Through this project, we have created a methodology and a preliminary test platform for detecting disease-indicative volatile chemical markers released by plants during a biotic-stress event such as fungal pathogen infections. There exists a market opportunity for commercialization of this technology, if the method and the platform could be extended to include detection mechanisms for multiple types of fungal pathogenic diseases. The intellectual merit of this technology lies in the potential benefits it could offfer in terms of short duration of the tests and and low cost compared to conventional molecular biology pathogen detection approaches. The broader impacts include direct societal impact on the agricultural industry for development of advanced crop management practices, economic impact where billions of dollars in chemical sprayings during crop growth and production could be minimized, and commercial impact where by an unmet need in the agricultural industry could be met by this technolgy, where the non-availability of a competive product for on-site disease detection provides an opportunity for bringing a new product to the market.

This will allow the clays to be reused in drilling mud and other clay applications, and the sand to be reused as proppant, rather than being discarded as solid wastes. This project will help promote American energy independence, national security, and economic competitiveness, because it solves two issues in the natural gas industry - namely how to reclaim solids that are conventionally landfilled, and how to manage radium.  

More broadly, the solids reclamation and radium management strategies developed here could also be used at other natural gas and petroleum-extraction operations in PA, TX, WY, CO, WV, and LA. The reuse of the solids will reduce traffic near hydrofracturing and decrease the volumes of waste hauled to landfills and the volumes of new material that is mined. The project will result in a pilot scale application of hydroacoustic cavitation-advanced oxidation (HAC-AO) for treatment of hydrofracturing waste solids. Importantly, HAC-AO offers the ability to treat solids in the presence of radium and hypersaline brines, when salt levels are 4-10 times higher than ocean water. This feature provides an advantage when compared to other technologies in this market space.  When these solids can be reclaimed and reused, operations costs will be significantly diminished. For example, when HAC-AO was applied to a mixed hydrofracturing solid waste slurry, about 15-20% of the solids could be reclaimed as high-quality clay, and 35-45% reclaimed as good sand proppant. That left only 35-40% remaining to be wasted. When considering clay and sand purchasing costs, and solids landfilling fees, this reclamation represented several hundred dollars per ton for the reclaimed material that would conventionally be wasted.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Specifically, clay-cation-radium interactions in the presence of hypersaline brines and cation-clay association kinetics, after the HAC-AO has exposed and activated fouled clay surfaces. Radium activities in hydrofracturing brines are often thousands of pCi/L range. Prior results show that the clays, when activated by HAC-AO, increase their capacity to capture radium. Importantly, this means that the other solids and liquids, when wasted, will conversely host less radium, making it unnecessary to truck them to radioactive waste sites; if more stringent regulations arise-as may happen. An HAC-AO system can reclaim both clay and silica sand proppant from hydrofracturing solid waste slurries and fluids.  When the Penn State team processed hydrofracturing waste brines in these prior studies, nearly all of the otherwise wasted clay could be reclaimed. 

During this project, graduate students will receive entrepreneurship experiences through interaction with the industrial partner, Hydro Recovery, LP. The project engages Hydro Recovery LP to both provide the waste materials and guide commercialization within the rapidly changing hydrofracturing industry. These two items are vital in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality and graduate students will benefit from working closely with Hydro Recovery during the process.","Ouyang, Bingjie and Renock, Devon J. and Ajemigbitse, Moses A. and Van Sice, Katherine and Warner, Nathaniel R. and Landis, Joshua D. and Feng, Xiahong~Radium in hydraulic fracturing wastewater: distribution in suspended solids and implications to its treatment by sulfate co-precipitation~Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts~21~2019~~~10.1039/C8EM00311D~10093917~339 to 351~10093917~OSTI~10/05/2019 13:01:54.883000000, Ajemigbitse, Moses A. and Cannon, Fred S. and Klima, Mark S. and Furness, James C. and Wunz, Chris and Warner, Nathaniel R.~Raw material recovery from hydraulic fracturing residual solid waste with implications for sustainability and radioactive waste disposal~Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts~21~2019~~~10.1039/C8EM00248G~10093912~308 to 323~10093912~OSTI~10/05/2019 13:01:54.726000000, McDevitt, Bonnie and McLaughlin, Molly and Cravotta, Charles A. and Ajemigbitse, Moses A. and Van Sice, Katherine J. and Blotevogel, Jens and Borch, Thomas and Warner, Nathaniel R.~Emerging investigator series: radium accumulation in carbonate river sediments at oil and gas produced water discharges: implications for beneficial use as disposal management~Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts~21~2019~~~10.1039/c8em00336j~10093913~324 to 338~10093913~OSTI~10/05/2019 13:01:54.843000000, McDevitt, Bonnie and Cavazza, Michael and Beam, Richard and Cavazza, Eric and Burgos, William D. and Li, Li and Warner, Nathaniel R.~Maximum Removal Efficiency of Barium, Strontium, Radium, and Sulfate with Optimum AMD-Marcellus Flowback Mixing Ratios for Beneficial Use in the Northern Appalachian Basin~Environmental Science & Technology~54~2020~~~10.1021/acs.est.9b07072~10180304~4829 to 4839~10180304~OSTI~03/08/2020 17:01:58.593000000, Tasker, T.?L. and Burgos, W.

Instead, the treated solids can now be reused with drilling mud and sand proppant so as to achieve more environmentally-sustainable operations. One manuscript describes the details of raw material characterization and treatment technologies for resource recovery from high salinity liquids and associated solids. This project has helped promote American energy independence, national security, and economic competitiveness, as it solves a huge issue in the oil and gas industry&mdash;namely how to manage a ubiquitous naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM), radium. This research has led to broader fundamental understanding of radium variability in hypersaline brines, radium geochemistry under reducing conditions during landfill disposal, and wastewater treatment options for hypersaline brines. Three manuscripts were developed that describe the measurement and characterization of radium in these brines and solids. Through this research a new treatment plant design was developed that focused on radium removal from hypersaline brines described in preliminary patent application that was filed: Provisional Patent Application Number: 62730213 ""Recovering Solid Materials From Hydraulic Fracturing Residual Solid Waste"". These novel methods can be applied to other industries with elevated NORM activities, including phosphate mining, metal ore mining and processing, conventional oil and gas wastewater, mine discharge and coal fly ash ponds.

In addition, the work completed under the affiliated NSF-INTERN collaboration with the US Geological Survey that had been added-on to this initial grant helped complete modeling of radium precipitation and adsorption under a range of salinities with varying competing ions in an open-source geochemical modeling platform that is available to the public. In total five refereed journal papers are published and available in the NSF-PAR; four others are being prepared for submission to peer review.  With the results of this research project, policy makers and regulators will have increased scientific findings on which to make policy. The impact on industry will be substantial, as this will enhance environmentally compatible hydraulic fracturing and wastewater treatment technologies. Finally, this project broadened the participation of underrepresented groups and trained three graduate and ten undergraduate students for the workforce, increasing the energy independence of the United States, and helping to create US jobs.

The proposed microwave flow cytometer (?FC) is important because it provides essential information to optimize the fermentation process, improve production yield, monitor microbial contamination, and control product quality in various industries, including the bioethanol fuel, brewing and distilling industries.  American companies in these industries support millions of jobs and produce several hundred billion dollars' worth of economic outputs annually.  Improving productivity and reducing financial loss caused by microbial contaminations are critical for their continued prosperity and growth.  

The microwave flow cytometer has the following unique features: reagent free cell detection and identification, robust operation, and user friendly instrumentation.  These features provide the following advantages: low cost operation, online counting of viable and nonviable yeast cells, and early detection of microbial contamination when compared to the leading competing technologies in the market space, such as optical density (OD) detection, radio-frequency biomass sensing, microscopy based cell counting, staining based viability evaluation, and chemical reaction based yeast activity monitoring.

This project will result in a proof-of-concept demonstration of microwave flow cytometer technology for accurately counting yeast cells (cells/mL) at high speed, determining yeast physiological state (viability and vitality), and identifying typical wild yeasts and bacteria in typical fermentation processes.  A preliminary database of the microwave properties and signatures of these microorganisms will be obtained.  This project will address the following knowledge and technology gaps: the microwave properties and signatures of typical fermentation yeasts and bacteria, the appropriate ?FC frequencies for individual yeast cell and bacteria detection and differentiation, and the techniques for the design, fabrication and operation of microwave flow cytometers.  

In addition, personnel involved in this project, including undergraduate and graduate students, will receive innovation experience through characterizing the microwave properties of yeast cells and identifying their signatures.  The students will receive technology translation experience through developing user friendly microwave flow cytometer instruments.  They will also receive entrepreneurship experience through close interactions with the industrial partners of the project.

This project engages Ferm Solutions and Wilderness Trail Distillery in Danville, KY to provide test environment and commercialization guidance in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.",,,"Yeast cells are the workhorse for corn-to-ethanol producers, brewers, and distillers. The basic information of yeast cells, such as their density (cells/mL), cell viability and vitality (e.g. budding), is important for process optimization, quality control, and yield improvement.  Microbial contaminations, such as wild yeasts, create considerable financial losses since they compete directly with yeast cells for nutrients and produce unwanted flavors or molecular impurities.  Therefore, various technologies and instruments, including microscopy-based cell counting, staining-based viability evaluation, chemical-reaction-based yeast activity monitoring, flow cytometers, optical density (OD) detectors and radio-frequency biomass sensors, are developed to address the market needs.  This project deals with a new method, microwave flow cytometry, for online yeast cell monitoring.  A few key techniques are developed and evaluated for potential commercialization.

A few types of microwave sensing electrodes, including microstrips, coplanar waveguides and multi-frequency microwave resonators, are built with different fabrication techniques developed and fine-tuned in this project.  Microfluidic channel networks are developed and integrated with the electrodes for sample solution handling.  A flow cytometer platform is established to incorporate with the electrodes.  Polystyrene particles with diameters from 1 to 8 &micro;m in DI water suspensions are used to test the flow cytometer performance at frequencies from approximately 0.2 to 8 GHz. Viable and non-viable Pastorianus Yeast and Cervisiae Yeast cells are characterized in the same frequency range, one cell at a time.  The permittivity values of each cell are obtained from measured scattering parameters with an algorithm developed in this project.  The permittivity parameters describe the intrinsic molecular polarizations and relaxation processes inside a cell.  It is shown that the developed flow cytometers can detect and characterize cells at a throughput of 1 cell/second.  Higher throughput, up to 10 cells/second, can be achieved with higher sample flow rate.  Viable and non-viable yeast cells show clear signal differences.  Furthermore, yeast cells of different strains yield clearly different signals at certain frequencies.  Thus, microwave flow cytometry has the potential to accurately count cells, differentiate cell viability and strains without using chemical or biological reagents.  These characteristics bode well for technology commercialization and transfer.  Nevertheless, more work is needed to improve cell counting accuracy when cell clumps are present in the sample.  Further evaluation with complex samples is necessary to define system performance.

This project provided partial support to four graduate students for their thesis work and research experience for two undergraduate students.  Two of the students are female.  The project also supported two graduate students with internship experience in a commercial yeast producer facility and one student with entrepreneurship development experience.

This system will allow metabolic engineers to more rapidly develop microorganisms for the production of various bioengineered chemicals and materials.   This novel genetic transformation system is important because the fields of synthetic biology and genetic engineering are currently limited by the ability to re-program microorganisms with foreign DNA. This project will result in a prototype high throughput genetic transformation platform to demonstrate the utility of the system. This genetic transformation platform will be able to process microorganisms nearly one hundred times faster than the current state of the art. 

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Electroporation, cell permeabilization using pulsed electric fields, is an efficient way to deliver DNA constructs into microorganisms for genetic engineering and synthetic biology applications. Standard electroporation protocols involve parallel plate cuvettes to expose cell and DNA samples to uniform electric fields. However, testing different electroporation conditions involves hundreds of experiments (e.g. varying DNA construct, cell type, buffer composition), which is slow, labor-intensive, and expensive. This project aims to develop a prototype high throughput platform for genetic transformation of bacteria using microfluidic flow-through electroporation. The prototype device will be operated in 1) large scale production of bioengineered chemicals and 2) in a discovery mode to identify optimal transformation protocols for genetic engineering. This scalable technology will accelerate the development of new bioengineered chemicals that can be manufactured in a renewable manner. 

Personnel involved in this project, research scientists, postdocs, and undergraduate students, will receive innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation experiences through participation in prototype design, customer interviews, business plan competitions, engaging with mentors, and establishing a company to commercialize the technology.

This system will help bring high value products to market such as new biologically derived therapeutics and biomaterials. Electroporation is the most robust method of genetic modification but is primarily performed manually, leading to slow, unreliable, and low throughput genetic engineering. The Scalable Pipette Tip for High-Throughput Genetic Engineering we have developed in conjunction with this award will ultimately allow researchers to perform genetic modification of cells nearly 10,000 times faster than the current state of the art, while maintaining separation of samples to avoid cross-contamination. This innovation enables continuous flow genetic manipulation of cells in a platform that can be easily automated through integration with liquid handling robots for fast, reliable, and scalable cell engineering.

 

There are several major highlights and achievements from this effort. With respect to manufacturing, we have used 3D printing to prototype dozens of potential pipette tip designs. As a result we have been able to successfully incorporate a microfluidic channels into pipette tips and achieve genetic transformation efficiencies comparable or higher than the state of the art cuvette based technology. Related to manufacturing, we also have been able to utilize COMSOL Multiphysics to model the electric field and effective flow patterns resulting from our 3D printed designs. This has allowed us to predict the electrical pulse seen by the cells while they flow through the pipette tips. Lastly, we have been able to show that our electroporation system can be used to genetically transform both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In the case of eukaryotic cells we have tested the platform on marine protists, single celled eukaryotic organisms, and found that we can deliver genetic material to organsims that are classically difficult to manipulate. This suggests that the system could have very broad applicability and increases the potential total addressable market for future commercialization efforts.

This is an additive manufacturing process to be used for the fabrication of Li-ion batteries. The technology is important because it eliminates slurry production, coating, and drying operations from lithium ion battery manufacturing as well as the need to recover and/or dispose of solvent. This has the potential to reduce the capital and operating cost of a battery plant.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. (1) Adhesion and cohesion properties of electrodes. With the removal of solvent in additive manufacturing process, the dispersion of the binder materials among other materials can be challenging, which compromises cohesion and adhesion properties. Research will be done to optimize the mixing process, the sequence of adding powders, and the powder dispensing process, in order to achieve uniformly distributed binder, which could lead to high adhesion and cohesion. (2) Electrochemical properties. With the removal of solvent, the manufactured electrode could exhibit structure difference in porosity, tortuosity and pore size, which could affect the electrochemical properties. A detailed study and optimization of each step during the additive manufacturing process, including multi-nozzle spray process and subsequent hot rolling/heat treatments, will be conducted to ensure comparable performance with conventional electrodes.

Four factors related to solvent during slurry cast process of electrode fabrication have contributed the high manufacturing cost of electrode (especially cathode) preparation: 1. The preparation of the slurry itself is a time-consuming and complex step since it is essential to create a homogenous material before the slurry can be coated onto the current collector. 2. The solvent typically used in the cathode slurry is N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) which is an expensive component of the slurry material.3. A time-consuming and energy-intensive drying procedure has to be employed to dry the slurry.4. The evaporated NMP needs to be collected in order to prevent potential environmental pollution. Motivated by the desire to reduce battery manufacturing cost and promote their applications in transportation, this NSF AIR project aims to develop and scale-up our patent-pending dry powder based additive manufacturing process to fabricate both anode and cathode. 
In this NSF project, the team scaled up additive manufactured electrodes for lithium ion batteries. Firstly, the team has studied the correlation between particle distribution and mixing conditions in order to achieve homogenous distribution of binder particles and active materials. By removing the solvent, the physics governing the dispersion of fine binder particles and the bonding formation will be drastically different from the conventional wet/slurry process. Therefore, inhomogeneity in mixture is one of the biggest obstacles in scaling up the manufacturing. It is found higher mixing speed and prolonged mixing time lead to de-agglomeration and uniform distribution of carbon black and binders. Secondly, the team has explored additive manufacturing to improve the bonding strength. Using additive manufacturing, binders can be selectively deposited on the electrode/current collector interface at large scales. Both cathode and anode fabricated with additive manufacturing show good rate performance and cycle life, which is comparable with the conventional slurry casted electrodes. Finally, the team has studied and optimized the electrostatic spraying and hot pressing parameters to achieve large scale and continuous manufacturing of electrodes. At the end of the project, continuous manufacturing of electrode with &gt;10cm in width has been achieved using a developed equipment resulted from this project.
The proposed research could lead to low cost lithium ion batteries. The knowledge gained in this project provides a cost effective way to achieve effective bonding similar to ""coated particle"" approach without the expensive particle coating step (e.g. spray drying). Finally,the undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project got significant improvement on communication, presentation and writing skills.

Many of these communities do not have the resources to improve the treatment system or comply with new discharge regulations. While most wastewater treatment plants are fully automated, including small plants, their susceptibility to failure are high and their ability to quickly recover and resume operation are low. In this project the research team will be developing an innovative smart monitoring and control system to provide early detection of wastewater treatment system failure at small facilities and low-cost, remote monitoring and control systems for small, decentralized wastewater treatment systems.

Water reclamation and reuse is not new, but discussions about new paradigms in water reuse, such as direct potable reuse, are accelerating across the country. Thus, when the source of water is explicitly impaired and it is destined to become drinking water, or even water for other beneficial applications, monitoring of water quality, early warning of treatment system failure, responsive operation, and an informed public are all critical to securing future water resources and protecting the public and the environment. A smart sensor network supported by smart data acquisition/processing and system-learning programs will ensure that next generation wastewater treatment systems can operate sustainably and continuously without negative impact on people and the environment. More than ever, plant operators and the public are highly informed and must have better tools to understand water quality and economics of domestic water reuse, and the negative impacts of water contamination. The human-centered system that will be developed through this project will provide these tools and stimulate energy efficiency system behaviors.

A unique testbed will be used to conduct this research. It consists of an advance sequencing batch membrane bioreactor (SB-MBR) hybrid system treating >7,000 gal/day of real domestic wastewater. The research team will use this platform to integrate existing and new wireless sensor networks to monitor water quality and for process monitoring and control, to facilitate and test the development of a smart data acquisition/processing and self-learning control system. The smart service system will enable early warning of wastewater treatment plant failure, thus preventing long-term recovery and negative impact on community services. The testbed has five distinctive components: a demo-scale, advanced water reclamation system, a novel sensor network incorporating cutting edge analytical probes and instruments, a novel data processing and self-learning control system, energy management optimization module, and a public interaction center. It will also enable treatment of water to different end quality to produce water for different reuse applications (i.e., tailored water reuse). This new generation, smart system for tailored water reuse will have flexible and adaptable control systems that utilize new, smart sensor technologies, which interact with each other, learn from past performance, and can predict future performance and adapt the system to achieve preset objectives. After testing the new monitoring and control system at a demonstration scale, the team will work with their industrial partners to deploy, incorporate, and test the novel system at existing, decentralized treatment plants.

This research addresses the needs of a large community of people who rely on public transportation for independent mobility, and yet face difficulties using it. For someone with poor vision or blindness, some level of cognitive impairment, or for a senior citizen, taking a bus on an unfamiliar route can become a challenge and a source of anxiety.  The problem is often one of scarce access to relevant information such as which bus to catch, which platform to wait on for a train, when to exit the vehicle and how to negotiate a transfer.  The smart service system will facilitate and promote use of mass transit systems as passengers, or their assistants, will be able to pre-register a trip, possibly involving multiple legs and different means of transportation from multiple agencies. It is envisioned that during the trip, passengers will receive context-aware information that will help ensure that they are waiting for a bus or a train in the right location; they are entering the desired bus vehicle or train car, and that they exit the vehicle at the correct stop or station. Importantly, authorized users (family members, friends, or assistants) will be able to monitor the user's trip remotely, and receive warnings when an unexpected situation occurs (e.g., when a user is waiting for a train in the wrong platform, enters the wrong bus, or is stuck at a certain location). Anonymized data about travelers can be relayed to the transit agency for enhanced service; for example, a bus driver can be informed that a blind passenger is waiting for the bus at a certain stop. RouteMe2 will promote increased travel independence, and thus increased opportunities for education, employment, socialization, participation, and leisure. It is expected that designing this type of human-centered technology with a clear societal benefit, and interacting with the participants in the user studies will be an inspirational and rewarding experience for the students involved in this research.


This technology will rely on interconnected sensors that can track a passenger during a trip, and on services that can provide just-in-time information to passengers on smartphones. This project will develop and experiment with a sensor and information infrastructure specifically designed to assist individuals with special needs while taking public transportation.  The RouteMe2 system will rely essentially on cloud services, complemented with location data from an infrastructure of economical, miniaturized sensors (iBeacons), as well as data from the smartphone carried by the user, such as data generated by its GPS and inertial sensors. Individuals from different communities of potential users of this system (senior citizens and people with visual or cognitive impairments) will contribute to system design by means of initial focus groups, and will test it with a series of carefully designed user studies.

World-wide, the impact is estimated at $2 billion in direct economic losses. When environmental and productivity costs are considered, the total harm from underground oil leakage is estimated to be much higher. The goal of this project is to develop a cost-effective, scalable, smart underground oil leak location system that can be modified to serve a host of applications in leak detection and pollution measurement including applications in gas leak detection, water leak detection, and pollution monitoring. The techniques developed through this project have the potential to improve future generations of distributed networked sensors through application of cloud computing technologies.  This new smart system, when implemented to detect underground leaks, and more generally, pollutants is expected to make significant, positive environmental impacts. Given the team's past successful work in underground oil leak detection and mitigation, an immediate impact in scaling oil leak detection is expected. At the same time, the mini-mass spectrometers can in the future be configured to monitor many contaminants, thereby addressing a variety of environmental challenges. 

Project objectives are: 1) build the core smart system components, 2) develop core algorithms and build the smart system test bed, and 3) validate the test bed functionality in the field. First, mini-mass spectrometers will be fabricated, and a dynamically configurable cloud computing network will be developed with the goal of connecting multiple mini-mass spectrometers into an analytical system to collect leak source data. Collected data will be analyzed and leakage locations will be identified based on distributed sensor readings using an algorithm developed to dynamically optimize sensor positioning and identify leak location. Finally, the smart system will be implemented in the field to monitor a controlled, low-level, perfluorocarbon tracer leak. The expected outcome of this program is a low cost, self-configurable, highly flexible, mobile system that can locate leaks and contaminants with minimal human intervention. 

The team consists of faculty at Duke University (Pratt School of Engineering, Nicholas School of the Environment, and Psychology and Neurosciences), and staff at UNC's Renaissance Computing Institute (Chapel Hill, NC) as well as industry partners, PFT Technology, LLC (Bellmore, NY; small business). Duke's team combines material science, computer engineering, mass spectrometry, behavioral science and commercialization expertise. RENCI brings expertise in the latest cyber tools and technologies. Our industry collaborator, PFT Technology, LLC is recognized internationally as the leader in the field of perfluorocarbon-based leak detection, demonstrating successful leak detection programs for utilities in both the U.S. and the U.K.

This manufacturing service system will enable highly functioning relationships between a range of users, including service consumers (e.g., designers, entrepreneurs, makers) and service producers (e.g., manufacturers). Design organizations and new entrepreneurs have limited access to the advanced manufacturing processes needed for innovation due to longstanding barriers associated with: (1) cost and availability of advanced manufacturing platforms and (2) technical skill and experience needed to design manufacturable products in a correct-by-construction framework. While direct-to-print paradigms, such as 3D printing, have increased the capabilities for users to make parts directly from digital product designs, the capital equipment for manufacturing functional components are still housed in mostly private enterprise facilities. Additionally, challenges to accurately specify product manufacturing requirements remain as barriers toward facilitating large-scale, consumer-driven manufacturing services. Smart manufacturing service systems that address these persistent challenges will dramatically accelerate innovation across multiple industrial sectors by removing technological barriers for functional manufacture. The consumerization of manufacturing services will also enable manufacturers with excess production capacity to access a significantly broader customer base, facilitating stabilization of production capacity through decentralization of service demand. Democratization of access to manufacturing capabilities and the associated sharing economy benefits will lead to transformative advances in product realization for the US economy.

To facilitate these collaborations, this research project leverages prior discovery for rapid, digital process planning based on novel hybrid dynamic tree representations and graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated parallel computing. To implement this novel discovery in a distributed service system, the digital process planning method will provide product and process intelligence for each user class. Human subjects experiments and user requirements modeling will inform system design for user interface functionality, service consumer cognitive processing, service provider informational needs, and consumer-to-producer interaction requirements. The service system architecture will be designed to interface with users, facilitate user transactions, receive and shape input data, and enable archival functionality. To realize the foundational digital process planning discovery in a novel human-centered service system, new information models for manufacturing-related data and service provider production capabilities will be established. Advanced computational algorithms will also be derived for scaling GPU-accelerated process analyses in a many-user, cloud-based environment. Comprehensive system testing will inform efficacy of the underlying user requirement models, service system architecture, manufacturing information models and GPU-accelerated computing for generalized human-centered manufacturing service systems.

The research project assembles a collaborative team of experts in the fields of manufacturing, design, computing and psychology and a diverse range of industrial partners and nonprofit agencies to realize a next-generation manufacturing service system. The lead institution is Georgia Tech with faculty from mechanical engineering, computing and psychology. The industrial partners, Tucker Innovations (small business), Mazak (large business), Morris South (large business), represent manufacturing technology developers and platform builders with interest in facilitating broad access of enterprise-level technologies to consumer end users. The partner industrial consortia, National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (non-profit), National Center for Defense Manufacturing and Machining (non-profit) and Digital Manufacturing And Design Innovation Institute (non-profit), provide access to a strong membership base spanning many industrial sectors. Collaborations at Georgia Tech with The Center for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning, Vertically Integrated Projects Program and VentureLab will facilitate connections of research outcomes to educational outcomes for the broad community of makers.","144.

Over the past two decades, cities have become a locus of population and economic activity. Currently, over 80% of the US population is concentrated in cities; furthermore, 80% of the Gross Domestic Product in the United States is produced in metropolitan areas. The concentration of people and economic activity makes cities even more vulnerable to extreme weather events.  Given these trends, effective hazardous weather warning systems are critical. Hazard warning systems are service systems that aim to minimize deaths, injuries, property loss, infrastructure destruction, and service or business disruption.  They include the sensors, forecasts, networking and communications, public safety personnel and decision-makers, warning information, and those who receive and respond to the warnings. 

CityWarn addresses three important issues for hazard notification service systems:  1) Coordination and sharing. Public safety agencies, private sector firms and the general public, all have their own hazard warning needs, and over the years, sector-specific, and even hazard-specific warning systems have evolved that may not share important information in efficient and useful ways. 2) Data Explosion. There's an explosion of data from all sources, from fine scale meteorological observations and traffic data, to humans reporting weather on social media. This is challenging for decision-makers who must quickly make sense of all of this information; and 3) Smart phone penetration. There is now a proliferation of smart phones, plus a trend toward hyperlocal, user-selected information. Warning systems have the potential to personalize weather warnings in a way that can make warning response more effective. 

CityWarn will deliver user-defined, dynamically changing alerts through a next-generation communications and networking platform. The platform is linked to a cutting edge radar system that provides high-resolution weather information on an urban scale of streets and neighborhoods. A mobile app delivers user-configured, weather information. Our integrated research will focus on Computing & Sensing, Behavioral Sciences, Engineered Systems and Testbeds. The Computing & Sensing thrust will develop new scalability, security, and functional advances within the communication and networking platform, and integrate high-resolution radar products and user-generated observations from the field. Through cognitive task analysis, usability studies, and live experiments, behavioral science researchers will learn how fieldworkers, such as utility workers, police, firefighters, stormwater personnel, use and share weather information in the context of their tasks and organizational constructs. Our engineered systems work will focus on aggregation and sharing of sensed information sources, automation of warning processes to address data overload problems, and user alert customization.  By developing a common platform for use by industry and public sector players, we hope to break down silos between existing warning systems and increase inter-agency coordination and improve response time and quality. The main test bed will be a living lab in the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex where weather data will be disseminated to users during actual severe weather events.

Unfortunately, university counseling centers (UCCs), which are the primary access points for students to receive mental health services, are facing significant challenges in meeting the increasing demands. Specifically, clinicians at UCCs still rely on patients' inaccurate and biased self-reported symptoms for depression assessment. In addition, UCCs provide mental health services only during working hours in clinical settings. The lack of service access when needed could leave patients floundering helplessly and lead to lifelong consequences. Furthermore, with tight budgets, clinicians at UCCs have not grown and some UCCs even downsized. As a consequence, more students did not receive timely treatment. This project focuses on designing and developing iSee, a smart device based behavior monitoring and analytics platform. iSee harnesses smartphones/wristbands to extend the reach of mental health care far beyond clinical settings and to deliver timely therapies when needed. Furthermore, the continuously tracked depression symptoms allow UCCs to be more accurately informed with the severity of each patient and thus reduces unnecessary visits so that clinician time can be better utilized.  If successful, iSee has the potential to enhance mental health services in thousands of colleges and universities, benefiting millions of college students. Although focusing on depression of college students, the technology can be extended to other mental health conditions such as anxiety, bipolar disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia; adapted to patients beyond college students; and deployed at other settings such as public hospitals and private clinics.

iSee consists of a smartphone/wristband sensing system running on the patient side to continuously and passively track patient's daily behaviors using onboard sensors; a behavior analytics engine using machine learning and causality analysis algorithms running on the cloud side to translate behavior sensor data into meaningful analysis results for identifying the patient's depression severity and revealing behavioral causes that lead to the mitigation or the deterioration of the patient's status; and a dashboard running on the clinician side to visualize behavior information as well as analysis results to help clinicians make clinical decisions and conduct treatment. The system would allow clinicians to access an objective, quantitative, and longitudinal record of patients' daily behavior to support evidence-based clinical assessment. This project involves a multi-disciplinary and cross-organizational team of researchers from Michigan State University (lead institution) and Northwestern University (Chicago, IL). The primary industry partner is Microsoft Research (Redmond, WA), which is a large business company in U.S. Michigan State University Counseling Center (East Lansing, MI), which will be the test bed for the integration and evaluation of the iSee smart service system.

Members of these communities are more likely to visit hospital emergency departments with advanced stages of oral disease that need surgical treatment; this increases the cost of dental care for families and burdens hospital resources. Tooth decay is the most common chronic disease in American children and adolescents age 6-19 despite being a preventable disease. In 2010, untreated tooth decay, or caries, affected 2.4 billion people worldwide. Early childhood caries leads to pain, infection, and discomfort. And in adults, chronic oral infections may increase the risk of preterm birth and diseases like diabetes and atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). This project will develop a hand-held electric-toothbrush-like device with a user-friendly interface that can be used in the home or by community health workers in schools or rural clinics. The wand, which uses a safe optical scanning method, will send data and images to a dentist, who will be able to monitor how well dental treatments are working. The data and images collected by the device can be analyzed to discover where plaque and bacteria are present, providing a way to predict, and then prevent, disease. The wand will be able to prompt the user to address problem areas. This system, which will connect remote users to a dental provider, has the potential to improve the prevention and treatment of oral disease and the quality of life for people who do not have convenient access to regular, in-person dental care. 

To enable this vision, this project will develop a smart system that offers screening, surveillance, and prediction for people to improve their oral health and prevent disease. A mature technology of laser-based imaging that is spatially registered with fluorescence spectral analysis will be used to study the complexities of the oral biofilm and dental demineralization. The bacterial measurement is performed with a hand-held single wavelength optical scanning probe that forms images from both reflectance and fluorescence contrast, with the option of taking laser-induced fluorescence spectra for diagnosis of enamel demineralization. To provide a smart interface, the optical information will be analyzed to identify trends, a new modality for the dental field. With analyses of the fluorescence signal from the plaque deposits displayed as a trend, the user, in collaboration with clinician, can monitor variations in oral health and the effectiveness of treatments. The research team will use an iterative process to develop, design, evaluate, and refine the tool. The tool will be tested for three scenarios: (1) a plaque- and caries-screening program for a trained lay user on an untrained ""patient"" (e.g., parent for a child, school nurse for pupils, pediatrician for young children, or staff at a remote rural clinic for patients); (2) a caries surveillance program for trained lay users electronically connected to a dentist who can guide the use of the tool; and (3) a caries prediction program, initially for clinical users.

Unfortunately, group meetings suffer from serious problems that undermine productivity and collegiality, including overt or unconscious bias, ""groupthink"", fear of speaking, and unfocused discussion.  Few automatic tools exist for keeping meetings on track, accurately recording who said what, and making group discussions more productive.  The goal of this research is to design intelligent rooms that provide facilitation services by identifying meeting participants, understand their conversations, summarize discussions, and help the group efficiently get through an agenda, all without requiring the participants to wear microphones or other sensors.   

The research will have broader impacts in several aspects.  Any steps to make group meetings for complex, long-term projects more productive and easier to control would result in immediate economic impact.  The success of a service system that facilitates long-term group interactions will result in a major opportunity for technology transfer and a highly marketable hardware/software platform for collaboration in domains including business, education, and finance.  The project will result in new group meeting data to be used by researchers in different fields such as organizational psychologists, and computer scientists.  Finally, the project will produce highly visible infrastructure for research and education that has the potential for greater public engagement with science and technology.

The research will be realized at different scales in two existing physical testbeds: the Smart Conference Room (SCR) at the Engineering Research Center for Lighting Enabled Systems and Applications (LESA) and the Collaborative Research Augmented Immersive Virtual Environment Lab (CRAIVE-Lab), a much larger space with a tall, panoramic screen.  Both testbeds will be expanded as part of this project to integrate sensing and computing technologies developed by the partners.  The major technology modules include:  (1) advanced time-of-flight sensors for robust occupant tracking, resulting in centimeter-accurate, real-time locations of all participants in the meeting without requiring video cameras or wearable sensors; (2) custom beamforming microphone arrays for acoustical tracking and sound source separation, allowing highly-directional beams to be directed at each participant's instantaneous location, clearly isolating their speech without requiring lapel or headset microphones; (3) natural language understanding algorithms for extracting knowledge from the speech, enabling the system to learn meeting-specific terminology, link concepts, assess speaker roles, and summarize discussion; and (4) cognitive computing tools for meeting facilitation, including assessments of participation and productivity, ideation interventions for brainstorming, and active decision support.  The resulting service systems will be cognitive physical environments that understand their occupants' locations, movement, speech, vocabulary, and intentions. A key aspect of the research is a multi-year study that tracks technical research groups that hold regular, unscripted meetings in the testbeds, assessing the effectiveness of the service system.

Application areas for such instruments include chemical detection, greenhouse gas/pollution and pipeline monitoring, homeland security, industrial process control, and medical diagnostics.  IC lasers are compact semiconductor light sources that are enabling components for sensor systems that correlate the absorption of mid-IR light with the presence of particular molecular species. This project will result in the demonstration and development of efficient IC laser sources that cover a wide range of mid-IR wavelengths. These IC lasers have the advantage of low power consumption when compared to other mid-IR lasers in this market space.  The availability of efficient mid-IR IC lasers will dramatically enhance chemical sensing capabilities and help to deploy the sensor network globally.  

This project addresses the technology gap related to mid-IR semiconductor IC lasers as the technology translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Efficient IC lasers have been developed primarily based on GaSb substrates in the wavelength region from 3 to 4 microns. This project will develop efficient IC lasers based on InAs substrates in the wavelength region of 4 to 10 microns that conventional interband lasers have not been able to reach. These InAs-based IC lasers will be able to operate continuously with low power consumption at room temperature. The project will match the laser wavelengths to fundamental absorption lines of target molecules in the region of 4 to 6 microns. Through further innovation of the device structure, the power consumption will be further reduced for operation in the continuous wave (cw) mode at room temperature. In parallel, the cw operating temperature will be increased for lasers operating at 6 to 10 microns. To reach these long wavelengths, InAs-based plasmon waveguides are required to significantly enhance optical confinement, improve thermal dissipation, and reduce strain. With a carefully designed strain-balanced structure and good control of growth parameters, high-quality epitaxial structures will be achieved for InAs-based IC lasers.

This project engages AdTech Optics, one of the leading commercial companies in mid-IR laser manufacturing with expertise in quantum cascade lasers, to further advance InAs-based interband cascade lasers into the commercial marketplace. The involvement of AdTech Optics will be particularly useful for addressing issues of reliability, thermal management, packaging, and yield.  Personnel involved in this project, including one postdoc, two graduate students, and at least three undergraduate students, will gain innovation, technology transfer, and entrepreneurship experiences through the entrepreneurship program in the university's business college, interactions with AdTech Optics, and participation in the research and market survey activities.","Rassel, S.M.Shazzad and Li, Lu and Li, Yiyun and Yang, Rui Q. and Gupta, James A and Wu, Xiaohua and Aers, Geof C.~High-temperature and low-threshold interband cascade lasers at wavelengths longer than 6???m~Optical Engineering~57~2018~~~10.1117/1.OE.57.1.011021~10079407~1~10079407~OSTI~13/11/2018 17:10:01.13000000",,"In this project, advanced plasmon waveguide interband cascade (IC) lasers were investigated and developed to operate at important wavelengths (3- 7 microns) for many applications such as chemical sensing and medical diagnostics.  These advanced interband cascade lasers can operate at room temperature and above with low power consumption, which are desirable for wide deployment in the field.  This project has demonstrated efficient operation of interband cascade lasers in a wavelength region beyond the boundary of traditional interband lasers.  These IC lasers will significantly benefit many useful applications, especially where mid-infrared systems must be operated with batteries and energy cost/availability is a concern, including space applications with strict constraints on size and electric power.  The availability of high-performance IC lasers will greatly enhance the capabilities of mid-infrared laser instruments and their applications in many areas including environmental monitoring, detection of gas pipe leakage, and area surveillance.   This research project has enriched cutting-edge knowledge in the design and understanding of quantum-engineered semiconductor structures and devices.   Students and postdocs have been offered unique opportunities in pursuing education, training and research in inherently multidisciplinary topics (materials science, quantum engineering, photonics, and device fabrication).  The students and postdocs supported by this project have gained extensive training in semiconductor devices, from concepts to realistic applications.  This project has also enhanced the infrastructure of Oklahoma for science and technology development.

Congestion costs the commercial trucking industry $9.2 billion annually, and incidents have been shown to increase the risk of secondary crashes by 2.8 percent with every minute of congestion. To address these economic and safety issues, traffic incident management (TIM) centers, typically operated by state departments of transportation (DOT), monitor roadways for traffic incidents, coordinate incident response, and provide traffic management and control to minimize the impacts of traffic incidents. This research will develop a new TIM system, called TIMELI (Traffic Incident Management Enabled by Large-data Innovations), that has greatly enhanced capabilities for incident risk assessment and response over current products. Software-based intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that are currently available are limited to very basic controls and do not provide comprehensive or dynamic decision support. These systems display streams of traffic data on a map and rely on technicians to input a control action. To address these limitations, this smart system aims to be a more effective data-driven TIM that provides user-centric information visualization and improved analytics and machine learning. Use of the system by state DOTs can reduce the duration and impacts of incidents and improve the safety of motorists, crash victims, and emergency responders. Use will also reduce the TIM technician fatigue and reduce their turnover rates. 

The goal and outcome of TIMELI is to use emerging large-scale data analytics to reduce the number of road incidents through proactive traffic control and to minimize the impact of individual incidents that do occur through early detection, response, and traffic management and control. This will be achieved using end-to-end machine learning for situational awareness, the design and rapid solution of geo-temporally aware traffic models using partial differential equations, stochastic model predictive control, and user-centric advanced visualization techniques for decision assistance. Current technology gaps in data handling and archiving, analysis for decision support, and the design of output formats will be addressed using big data technologies. Multiple large data streams will be ingested and data analytics will be performed for quality assurance and anomaly detection. New algorithmic approaches, machine learning, and a stochastic framework will be used to detect anomalous outliers and implement context-sensitive traffic models. An advanced human machine interface will provide information visualization and decisions recommendations in an intuitive format to minimize any cognitive bottlenecks. The objectives are to develop TIMELI and to integrate it into an existing TIM system. These will be accomplished by the following methods: (1) defining TIM user requirements and identifying bottlenecks in technician tasks using human factors research; (2) developing a prototype that includes a big-data-enabled back-end solution, an analytics engine, and a front-end interface; and (3) conducting testing, evaluation, and integration within Iowa DOT's existing TIM environment. TIMELI's multiple innovations will transform current TIM systems by creating a smart and reliable decision assist system used to monitor traffic conditions in real time, proactively control risk using advisory control, quickly detect traffic incidents, identify the location and potential cause of these incidents, suggest traffic control alternatives, and minimize cognitive bottlenecks for TIM operators. The test bed will be the Center for Transportation Research and Education's fully functional traffic operations lab that is connected to the Iowa DOT's data streams.

This research will contribute to education by involving undergraduate and graduate researchers in Civil Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Human Factors Engineering, and will generate real-world data sets that will be used in developing educational material.

The partners in this project are Iowa State University (lead academic institutions), TransCore (a commercial provider of intelligent transportation systems, Des Moines, IA), and Iowa Department of Transportation-DOT (government agency, Ames, IA).",,,,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY

Computer Aided Design (CAD) software for LoCs is important because many industrial practitioners who desire highly customized LoCs lack the means to obtain them at a low cost and within a reasonable timeframe. Meanwhile current design methodologies cannot keep pace with current Moore's Law-rates of growth in the number of integrated microfluidic components and ever-increasing device complexity. This project will result in a prototype CAD software platform for LoCs, which offers the following unique features: a 2D sketch-based interface, a microfluidic component library, integrated fluid modeling to guide 3D volumization of components and fluid channels, automatic design rule checking, assistance with choosing fabrication technologies and materials, and 3D rendering capabilities. These features provide the key advantage of a platform tailored to meet the needs of users who are trained to design biological experiments, as opposed to engineers and technologists, and to provide improvements in usability and user productivity compared to the leading competing general-purpose CAD tools and finite element analysis software presently employed in this market space. 

This project addresses the following technology gap as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Current design practice for microfluidic laboratories-on-a-chip (LoCs) requires the user to create a design using complex engineering CAD software, then iterate through additional flow simulation software to assess correctness of the design. In contrast, this project proposes a new design paradigm wherein fluid modeling algorithms drive an informed design process specific to microfluidic technologies in general, and LoCs in particular. This is considerably more appealing to potential users than iteratively applying an ad-hoc design process and then using formal methods exclusively to establish the (in)correctness of each resulting design. This project will tightly integrate CAD software that employs a sketch-based interface, in-line with current design practices today, with fluid modeling algorithms that can iteratively assist the user in terms of refining the sketch and semi-automatically rendering a 3D image of the working device, which accounts for component and channel geometries, etc. It will also provide the option to employ design automation algorithms to accelerate the design process, automatic design rule checking, and will help guide the user to select appropriate fabrication technologies and materials in line with cost, time-to-market, and product performance objectives. 

Personnel involved in this project, one Postdoctoral researcher and one PhD student, will receive innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation experiences through training and mentorship on business-related topics provided by project Co-PI Gunnar Hurtig, and a ""Technology Transfer Roadshow"" spearheaded by UCR's Technology Transfer Office, which are expected to culminate in company formation.  The project engages Lattice Automation, Inc., PharmaSeq, and Potomac Affinity Proteins, LLC, who will permit the project team to use the microfluidic CAD software to reproduce existing products, and possibly to design new products, which can provide initial validation of the CAD software prototype in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.","McDaniel, Jeffrey and Grover, William H. and Brisk, Philip~The case for semi-automated design of microfluidic very large scale integration (mVLSI) chips~Design Automation and Test in Europe~~2017~~~10.23919/DATE.2017.7927283~10026408~1793 to 1798~10026408~OSTI~06/07/2017 17:02:11.963000000, Wang, Junchao and Rodgers, Victor G. and Brisk, Philip and Grover, William H.~MOPSA: A microfluidics-optimized particle simulation algorithm~Biomicrofluidics~11~2017~~~10.1063/1.4989860~10026407~034121~10052419~OSTI~06/07/2017 17:02:11.726000000, Crites, Brian and Kong, Karen and Brisk, Philip~Diagonal Component Expansion for Flow-Layer Placement of Flow-Based Microfluidic Biochips~ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems~16~2017~~~10.1145/3126529~10067820~1 to 18~10067820~OSTI~11/08/2018 09:01:46.186000000, Crites, Brian and Kong, Karen and Brisk, Philip~Reducing Microfluidic Very Large Scale Integration (mVLSI) Chip Area by Seam Carving~Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI~~2017~~~10.1145/3060403.3060461~10026406~459 to 462~10026406~OSTI~06/07/2017 17:02:12.390000000, McKenzie, Brittney A. and Robles-Najar, Jessica and Duong, Eric and Brisk, Philip and Grover, William H.~Chronoprints: Identifying Samples by Visualizing How They Change over Space and Time~ACS Central Science~~2019~~~10.1021/acscentsci.8b00860~10108653~ ~10088548~OSTI~07/08/2019 21:01:55.466000000, Crites, Brian and Sanka, Radhakrishna and Lippai, Joshua and McDaniel, Jeffrey and Brisk, Philip and Densmore, Douglas~ParchMint: A Microfluidics Benchmark Suite~2018 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization~~2018~~~10.1109/IISWC.2018.8573487~10088205~78 to 79~10088205~OSTI~16/03/2019 05:01:48.606000000, Wang, Junchao and Fu, Lingxuan and Yu, Liyang and Huang, Xiwei and Brisk, Philip and Grover, William H.~Accelerating Simulation of Particle Trajectories in Microfluidic Devices by Constructing a Cloud Database~2018 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)~~2018~~~10.1109/ISVLSI.2018.00126~10067824~666 to 671~10067824~OSTI~11/08/2018 13:01:44.703000000, Ott, Jason and Loveless, Tyson and Curtis, Chris and Lesani, Mohsen and Brisk, Philip~BioScript: programming safe chemistry on laboratories-on-a-chip~Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages~2~2018~~~10.1145/3276498~10088204~1 to 31~10088204~OSTI~16/03/2019 05:01:48.420000000, Curtis, Christopher and Grissom, Daniel and Brisk, Philip~A compiler for cyber-physical digital microfluidic biochips~Proceedings of the 2018 International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization - CGO 2018~~2018~~~10.1145/3168826~10067821~365 to 377~10067821~OSTI~11/08/2018 09:01:45.750000000, Wang, Junchao and Rodgers, Victor G. and Brisk, Philip and Grover, William H. and Cao, Bing-Yang~Instantaneous simulation of fluids and particles in complex microfluidic devices~PLOS ONE~12~2017~~~10.1371/journal.pone.0189429~10067819~e0189429~10067819~OSTI~11/08/2018 09:01:46.36000000",,"This research project aimed to reduce the risk associated with commercialization of design software specific to microfluidics and laboratory on-a-chip technology. 


The intellectual merit of the project focused on the creation of a user-friendly graphical interface and effectively integrating fluid modeling algorithms into the design process. This led to a number of high-impact publications in both Computer Science and Chemistry/Microfluidics/Technology-oriented peer-reviewed conferences and journals. The PI and collaborators have founded a company to commercialize the software artifact produced by the research funded by this award. 


In terms of broader impacts, microfluidics and Laboratory-on-a-Chip (LoC) technology are used for a wide variety of purposes, the vast majority of which directly benefit society. The key benefits of LoCs compared to traditional benchtop chemistry methods are miniaturization (which reduces the physical volume of samples and reagents used) and automation, which reduces cost and mostly eliminates human errors. Moving forward, it is expected that automation will allow the creation of new bioassays (chemical procedures) that incorporate orders of magnitude more steps than could be carried out by human laboratory technicians. The research conducted under this award aimed to simplify the design process for microfluidic chips. This, in turn, lowers the barrier to entry, thereby increasing the number of scientists who can use microfluidics into their laboratories and the number of companies that sell products that integrate microfluidic features. 
Other broader impacts include the training of Project Scientists, PhD students, and undergraduates studying Bioengineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside. Several of the project participants are from groups typically underrepresented in STEM, including women, African Americans, and Latin(o/a)s; the PI published several peer-reviewed papers with undergraduate co-authors, including several women. Additionally, the project entailed extensive outreach to stakeholders including researchers in the biological and chemical sciences, as well as the Microfluidics Consortium, an industry group comprising ~25 small-to-medium sized companies working on microfluidics. Lastly, the PI and other project participants trained local teachers in California to integrate programming knowledge and concepts into their curriculum, to improve computer literacy and improve the technical capabilities of the next-generation workforce.

This system has the potential to improve outcomes and reduce drawbacks now experienced by patients during cancer treatment. Currently, only a small fraction of chemotherapeutic drugs reach tumor sites. The rest of these drugs, systemically administered at dosages strong enough to eradicate cancer cells, are distributed throughout the body, causing extensive damage to normal tissue. The developed drug delivery system attaches a powerful chemo-drug, Doxorubicin, to a thermally responsive, biopolymer, elastin-like polypeptide (ELP). At physiological temperatures (37?C), this ELP exists in a more liquid state (soluble). However, the ELP can be prompted by an externally applied, clinically available, mild hyperthermia (40-41?C) to undergo a phase transition (into being more solid) and aggregate at the tumor site. To help these aggregated ELPs and their attached Doxorubicin enter the tumor cells at this site, a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), is also conjugated to the ELP. This drug delivery system thus makes an innovative use of conjugated drug delivery biopolymers, an external, localizing heat, and a peptide able to mediate entry into cancer cells, where it can release the Doxorubicin for a more targeted and efficient tumor cell uptake and action.

The project will yield an externally triggered drug delivery system that can greatly improve the selective delivery of anti-cancer drugs to breast tumors by its unique exploitation of three key features: (1) the passive targeting properties of macromolecular carriers deriving from the enhanced permeability and retention effect, (2) active drug targeting to tumor sites by a clinically available external trigger, and (3) efficient, intracellular tumor drug delivery mediated by a cell penetrating peptide to reduce tumor growth, improve treatment outcomes, and retain better patient quality of life. The developed drug delivery system confers important advantages over competing systems based on drug-polymer conjugates, drug antibody conjugates, liposomes, and nano- and microparticles: (1) this drug delivery system enhances drug half-life and improves drug pharmacokinetic profile; (2) ELP modification by a CPP dramatically (15-20 fold) enhances cellular uptake, yielding more efficient tumor vasculature penetration and greatly enhancing  efficacy in both tumor cell entry and the targeting of specific cellular compartments; (3) the water-solubility of lipophilic or water-insoluble drugs can be attained/much improved by their coupling to ELP biopolymers; (4) ELP biopolymers, based on simple genetic code, are simple and inexpensive to manufacture, can be easily modified to add therapeutic peptides for intracellular targeting, and can contain more than one drug, permitting their use in combination therapy. With this targeted drug delivery system, therapeutic drugs can be administered at maximum tolerated dose, but with substantially reduced side effects, resulting in greatly increased cancer treatment efficacy. The system thus addresses current drug delivery technology limitations and yields a competitive advantage over existing approaches for treating localized tumors, one better targeting tumor cells and sparing healthy tissue.  

In addition, through a structured program of seminars and workshops, graduate students and post-docs will be guided in recognizing and implementing key steps for advancing the commercial potential of research. They will be introduced to case-based business research and collaboration, as well as regulatory and market research skills, crucial to creating viable business plans that permit the translation of vital research discoveries to the marketplace where their potential benefits can be maximized.

While encouraging news, breast cancer remains a significant health problem. Currently, the most common treatment for breast tumors remains surgical resection of the tumor followed by chemo- and/or radiotherapy.  However, this approach is limited by normal tissue tolerance and/or tumor resistance, and too often patients are unable to sustain the toxic effects of therapy. This unacceptable outcome is greatly heightened by the fact that only a small fraction of chemotherapeutic agents, administered at dosages potent enough to eradicate, will reach the actual cancer cells. The remainder scatters throughout the body causing widespread damage to normal tissue. Therefore, breast cancer survivors often experience long-term consequences of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy treatments. The research supported by this award was designed to develop a targeted drug delivery system which can specifically deliver most of the cancer killing drug to the tumor tissue while minimizing the damage to healthy tissue. This drug delivery system is dependent on a component protein called elastin like polypeptide (ELP), which when injected in the patient, freely circulates in the blood stream. However, when the tumor is locally heated, ELP carrying the anticancer drug changes its shape and accumulates in the tumor tissue. To better penetrate tumor tissue, ELP is modified with a cell-penetrating peptide, which enables drugs to reach inside tumor cells and kill them. It was previously thought that there was just one type of breast cancer; however, we now know that is not the case. There are several different breast cancer types, and different types of breast cancer respond to the treatments in a different way. We have tested our approach in models of the three most prominent types of breast cancer, which have different hormone receptors on the cancer cell surface.  We have shown that our drug delivery system efficiently delivered the anticancer drug doxorubicin to tumors in a mouse models of breast cancer. Furthermore, while tumor size was radically reduced, regardless of breast cancer type, treatment itself had minimal effect in treated animals. These results are very promising and show that the ELP carrier system has the potential to increase treatment efficacy, and minimize the side effects of systemic therapy and the burdens they incur.

 

The second part of our project was focused on teaching student investigators early in training to recognize and implement key steps for advancing the commercial potential of their work. Translating a research discovery from the results of a well-designed study into a technology that addresses market imperatives is a crucial skill, without which bioscience outcomes are unlikely to obtain any considerable public benefit.  Most researchers, however, face this task with no formal business training; so many potentially important advances never reach consumers.  In order to bridge this wasteful gap, we have designed a structured program which will equip graduate students and postdocs to expect, navigate and respond to market needs. We have organized a series of seminars and workshops led by local business educators and leaders in entrepreneurial and business innovation and commercialization. As a result of this 18-month program, student participants acquired and practiced bench-to-market research translation skills which will help them to move their research discoveries from the lab to the marketplace for the public good.

The electrochemical pretreatment process will enable large-scale inland desalination using RO and NF.  Currently, large-scale RO and NF are not commonly practiced in non-coastal areas due to the high costs of brine disposal.  Decreasing the volume of brine production by one order of magnitude will make inland RO and NF cost-effective.  This will enable both municipally treated wastewater and brackish groundwater to be used as sources of potable or industrial water.  These two new sources of water will obviate water scarcity imposed restrictions on economic development in arid regions of the country.  The project will result in a proof-of-concept for operating a fluidized bed crystallization reactor using base solutions produced via bipolar membrane electrodialysis.  In contrast to commercialized pretreatment processes for RO and NF that only remove particulate contaminants, the proposed process removes both dissolved contaminants and particulates larger than 5 ?m.  This will greatly reduce membrane fouling and increase water recovery compared to conventional pretreatment processes for RO and NF. 

Several key aspects of the proposed technology require proof-of-concept testing before commercialization.  These include determining: 1) how system operating parameters affect removal of membrane fouling constituents; 2) the long-term operation and maintenance costs associated with operating the bipolar membrane electrodialysis reactor; and 3) the impact of micron-sized mineral solids on the concentrate side of a specially designed NF module.  The testing will be performed using municipally treated wastewater at the Water and Energy Sustainable Technologies (WEST) Center that is co-located with the Pima County Agua Nuevo wastewater treatment plant.  The experiments and testing will be performed by gradate and undergraduate researchers who will also participate commercialization workshops sponsored by Tech Launch Arizona and Innovate UA.

HDR will provide an objective, independent evaluation of this treatment technology based on their understanding of real world applications.

Converting municipally treated wastewater into potable water requires the use of high pressure membranes that can separate dissolved and suspended contaminants from the water.  Reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) can be used for this purpose.  The two largest problems with RO and NF are membrane fouling and brine disposal.  These two problems are closely linked in that membrane fouling limits the fraction of the feed water that can be recovered as potable water.  Feed water that is not turned into potable water is recovered as a waste brine solution.  Brine disposal is costly and can result in ground and surface water contamination by dissolved salts.  Membrane fouling commonly occurs from precipitated mineral scale from the hardness ions in the water, dissolved organic matter that sticks to the membrane and bacteria that grow on the membrane surface.  The goal of pretreatment processes for RO and NF is to obtain the highest level of foulant removal that is technically and economically feasible.    
 
This Accelerating Innovation Research-Technology Translation (AIR-TT) project provided a proof-of-concept for a new treatment process that removes water contaminants that may foul RO and NF membranes used for producing potable water.  In contrast to commercialized pretreatment processes for RO and NF that only remove particulate contaminants, the new process removes dissolved contaminants and particulates.  The treatment process involves the use of a fluidized bed crystallization reactor (FBCR) that is operated at a high pH to precipitate scale-forming mineral solids and dissolved organic matter.  The high pH in the reactor is also biocidal to microorganisms, thereby preventing microbial fouling.  The base used for pH adjustment was generated from the waste brine solutions using bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED).  
 
In this research, a 1 gallon per minute treatment system was constructed and tested on treated wastewater produced by the Pima County (Arizona) Agua Nuevo Wastewater Treatment Plant.  Water exiting the wastewater treatment plant was fed through the fluidized bed crystallization reactor to remove scale forming minerals and dissolved organic matter.  The effect of the reactor pH value on contaminant removal was determined.  Under optimized conditions, the fluidized bed crystallization reactor was able to remove up to 99.9% of dissolved magnesium, 97% of dissolved calcium, and 25% of the dissolved organic matter.  The fluidized bed crystallization reactor was also tested on a waste brine solution produced by a RO system that did not employ the new pretreatment process.  Removal of scale-forming minerals and organic matter from the waste brine allowed the brine to be passed through a second RO system, thereby increasing water recovery and minimizing brine disposal costs.  We are in the planning stage to test the new treatment system on brackish water in conjunction with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.

This 3D Content-based data management system is important because of its impact on information support for the 3D printing and manufacturing industry. The 3D manufacturing industry is facing a growing challenge in managing web-scale 3D content and the progress in managing 3D repositories is still in its early stages. As a result, systems that are capable of managing large-scale 3D content play a critical role in fostering a market for 3D content that is more accessible and offers the potential for new job and income opportunities for both content creators and consumers (e.g. by reducing the barrier for a startup to bring a new product to market). The project will result in a proof-of-concept of a web-scale system with the following unique features: object browsing, query processing, and interaction of 3D object composition/decomposition mechanisms. These features provide the advantages of an implementation based on a micro-services model for complex applications, which is a new architecture in this market space.

This project addresses several technology gaps in 3D information management as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Specifically, it includes computational methods such as similarity measurements based on a many-to-many matching algorithm that work with volumetric representations of 3D objects and produce a direct correspondence between two objects and their parts, which can be used for registration and juxtaposition. It will also transition several developed mechanisms for indexing a part-based representation of 3D objects, which in turn can be used for efficient retrieval of candidates from a database of models. Our proposal for partial matching of 3D parts will utilize a novel morphing of level sets of 3D surfaces that provides a shape similarity metric between the two surfaces. This metric will allow us to perform high accuracy matching of generalized surfaces. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including four upper-level (junior or senior) undergraduates, will receive entrepreneurship and technology translation experience through exposure to real-world software engineering processes, information retrieval, and large-scale data management tools. This experience will provide the skills, knowledge and experience to prepare the students for either academic careers or employment in industry. 

The project engages 3D Industries (3DI) Ltd. to ensure the Drexel team?s translational research efforts under the project remain on track to solve critical commercial needs and to minimize the time to market. 3DI's participation will augment the Drexel team?s research efforts while also creating the opportunity for the Drexel team to quickly receive and adapt to feedback from real-work users.",,,"The escalating growth in 3D printing is creating new opportunities for search and retrieval mechanisms in 3D repositories. This proposal builds software components required for managing 3D repositories of digital artifacts while supporting high-performance search and retrievals.  The progress in managing 3D repositories is still in its early stages.  We expect that the software components created under this project will yield improvements in the accuracy and efficiency with which digital objects can be segmented in complex 3D scenes and similar models identified from within vast repositories of 3D CAD models such utilized by manufacturing industry.  By improving accessibility to existing content networks, it is expected that both the size and number of participants in the 3D model market will expand greatly. The project has created the software components for a proof of concept, 3D content-based retrieval system that can be incorporated to form into a three-tier system consisting of interface, 3D composition, and data-management layers. This components support object browsing, query processing, and interaction of 3D object composition/decomposition mechanisms. In order to achieve high performance and a high level of modularity. The proof of concept is implemented using microservices (a software architecture style in which complex applications are composed of small, independent processes working together using programming language independent REST-APIs). This system will include an indexing system, querying component, and matching component.   The broader commercial impacts of an effective 3D content-based retrieval system are far reaching.  We anticipate that the system will reduce the cost to source components, and design and manufacture new products.  It will allow companies to train employees more effectively and efficiently and at lower costs when used in conjunction with Augmented Reality (AR).  Use of AR in day-to-day manufacturing operations (e.g. in assembly and quality control) will also allow employees to perform better and more efficiently while enduring less fatigue.  It will also help company?s identify specific instances of IP infringement and reduce the overall occurrence of counterfeiting. An important practical societal impact is that an effective 3D content discovery system will increase the likelihood of finding replacement parts for both consumer and commercial devices (e.g. appliances) that can be economically 3D-printed. Extended device life translates directly to reduced burden on household budgets of all sizes, but is most impactful for low-income households.  Extended device life also has a direct environmental impact, keeping this material out of landfills.  A more accessible 3D content system also has the potential to promote greater literacy in computer-aided design techniques and general manufacturing techniques, primarily additive manufacturing.

The proposed technology is important because Lithium-ion batteries need significant improvement to keep pace with the needs of customers who are demanding high specific energy, long service life, high power on demand and quick charging. If scalable, the proposed graphene technology could help satisfy these requirements and could find widespread use in various applications such as wearables (smart watches and google glass), portable electronics (cell phones, laptops), unmanned aerial vehicles as well as electric vehicles and grid storage. This project will result in a scaled-up demonstration of a minimally viable product (MVP). Based on preliminary testing, this MVP is expected to deliver volumetric and gravimetric energy densities of up to ~1000 Watt-hour/liter and ~650 Watt-hour/kilogram respectively. These performance metrics are 2-3 fold superior to the incumbent graphite anode technology which is extensively used in today's Lithium-ion batteries.

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: (1) Methods to achieve scalable (roll-to-roll) manufacturing of graphene electrodes for Lithium batteries and (2) Assembly of the electrodes into larger format pouch/cylindrical cells that can deliver the voltage and capacity-ratings of various end-use applications. To address manufacturing, the team will develop novel aqueous electrode slurries that can be deposited in a scalable manner using state-of-art doctor blade and slot-die coating methods. The deliverable for this project will be a minimally viable product (pouch and cylindrical cell batteries) that can be subjected to third-party validation and also field-tested by potential customers. This will facilitate joint development agreements with customers and private investors to begin production at industrially relevant scales. 

The students (1 graduate and 2 undergraduates) involved in the project will develop important skill-sets including scalable electrode manufacturing, pouch/cylindrical cell assembly and system level testing of the prototypes. In a pure laboratory environment, such studies are often excluded, thereby preventing the students from experiencing the stringent standards and rigors of the industry. Additionally, the students will actively participate in conferences and other networking events where they will have extensive networking opportunities and the potential to meet like-minded entrepreneurial students and industry experts.","Suresh, Shravan and Wu, Zi Ping and Bartolucci, Stephen F. and Basu, Swastik and Mukherjee, Rahul and Gupta, Tushar and Hundekar, Prateek and Shi, Yunfeng and Lu, Toh-Ming and Koratkar, Nikhil~Protecting Silicon Film Anodes in Lithium-Ion Batteries Using an Atomically Thin Graphene Drape~ACS Nano~11~2017~~~10.1021/acsnano.7b01780~10026208~5051 to 5061~10026208~OSTI~21/06/2017 13:02:13.740000000",,"Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have emerged as the preeminent energy storage technology over the last several decades. However, improvements in energy density have stagnated in recent years. To keep pace with the needs of customers who are demanding increasingly higher specific energy, it is necessary to significantly improve the performance of lithium-ion batteries. 

In this project, we have replaced traditional graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries with a new composite electrode comprised of graphene oxide, silicon nanoparticles and larger graphitic particles. Silicon greaty outperforms graphite as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries but tends to fracture after repeated cycles of charge and dicharge. In our design, the purpose of the graphene oxide is that it wraps around the silicon nanoparticles, providing an elastic buffer that protects and prevents them from fracturing and pulverizing. We demonstrated scale up of our battery concept from coin (or button) cell prototypes to much larger form factor pouch cells. These pouch cells represent a Minimum Viable Prototype (MVP) that builds confidence in the performance and safety characteristics of the underlying technology. 

Our results indicate that use of just 10 weight% of silicon nanoparticles translates to between 20-30% improvement in energy density when compared to the very best lithium-ion batteries being developed by industry leaders such as LG, XALT and Panasonic. However, our analysis indicated that the cost of silicon nanoparticles and graphene oxide represents the primary barrier to successful commercialization of this technology. To address this, we successfully synthesized high purity, battery-grade silicon nanoparticles from low cost sand-based precursors through a rapid, one-step microwave exfoliation process. We have also successfully replaced graphene oxide with ultra-low-cost carbon nanosheets synthesized from agricultural precursors (e.g., hemp) by using a straightforward and cost-effective steam-based exfoliation and pyrolysis process. Finally, we have successfuly demonstrated a Minimum Viable Prototype (MVP) that utilized the low cost silicon nanoparticles derived from sand and the low cost graphene nanosheets derived from hemp. Education and outreach activities included presentations and demonstrations of the battery technology to middle school students from the North Colonie School District in Latham, NY. 

 

 

Overall, this work has advanced the science, technology and commercialization prospects of deploying silicon/carbon composites as lithium-ion battery anode materials. We have formed strategic partnerships with Lubrizol, Clarkson Univerity and the Indian Intitute of Technology (Bombay, India) to help move this technology from lab to market. This technology could enable significant reduction in battery weight, size and cost for a wide range of applications including laptops, cell phones, wearable devices, electric vehicles as well as grid storage.

Currently, more than 1.3 million bone-repair procedures are performed annually in the USA, and a large proportion of them are for large defect repair.  The project will result in a prototype of the scaffold production as well as initiation of the FDA documentation process of the biomimetic scaffold.   The biomimetic scaffold will directly address the problems of most currently existing bone grafting materials on the market, including poor osteoconductivity, poor mechanical properties, and dissimilar degradation rates to natural bone regenerating rates.  It has demonstrated enhanced bone forming capability when compared to a leading product in this market space. The new bone substitute material will greatly benefit patients who suffer from bone defects caused by accidents or diseases, and are in need of orthopedic surgery.  Commercialization of this product will greatly improve quality of life for patients, shorten rehabilitation time, and substantially lower medical costs associated with hospitalization and health care.

The biomimetic scaffold has the following unique features which make it a competitive product in the bone grafting market: (1) Tunable micro- and macro-structure suitable for enhanced vascularization, osteoprogenitor cells migration, and new bone formation; (2) Mild fabrication conditions (room temperature and neutral pH) and simple fabrication process, which makes the scale-up manufacturing step easy to achieve at a low cost; (3) Superior mechanical properties, providing the necessary mechanical strength for initial surgical handling and mechanical support prior to new bone formation; (4) Excellent osteoconductivity compared to both a commonly used equiaxed scaffold and a commercial scaffold, which will significantly reduce patients' rehabilitation time; (5) Degradation rate matching the ingrowth rate of new bone, leading to perfect defect repair by natural bone that is superior to any artificial bone substitute materials on the market.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. It will center on issues related to the biomimetic scaffold scale-up and prototype, such as inhomogeneity and irreproducibility of large pieces of scaffold. To address these problems, heat flow analyses will be conducted and a tight control system will be established, which will further advance understanding of the interrelationship between scaffold structure/property and processing parameters in scaffold scale-up and prototyping. 

The project will be led by a materials scientist, guided by two entrepreneurs for commercialization, and advised by an orthopedic surgeon to provide the team the end-user perspective.

The resilient and programmable metro optical networking system is important because it can enable data traffic bottlenecks to be rapidly resolved and high bandwidth applications such as big data, telemedicine, and video to be flexibly moved to high capacity express-ways. For example, large volumes of data could be rapidly moved out of the path of natural disasters such as hurricanes. With this innovation, following a disaster, available live fiber connections can be flexibly managed to enable the highest available capacity and connectivity. This project will result in a proof-of-concept reconfigurable fiber system that has the unique capability to automatically switch the metro fiber connections between different metro, access, and data center optical transmission systems. These features provide a more efficient use of fiber infrastructure, more cost effective and reliable fiber capacity for high bandwidth services, and greater resilience to natural disasters.  

This project addresses several technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. This new reconfigurable fiber system will enable optical networks to be reconfigured to provide wavelength and fiber scale bandwidth on demand in metro networks. The main concept involves using space switching in metro network nodes or central offices to reconfigure the fiber connectivity across multiple communication platforms including reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexing (ROADM) and other access and distribution optical systems. Novel optical physical layer control algorithms and software defined networking (SDN) based protocols will be used to manage switching over optically amplified links on fast time scales.

DH is a dental condition that inflicts severe pain in majority of people sometime during their lifetime. The currently available products attempt only to treat the symptoms temporarily, and there is no lasting cure of the problem. This project focuses on nano-macro porous glass fabrication technology and applying a new class of bioactive materials to the regeneration of dental tissue. The resulting glasses, which have tailored amorphous multiporous (TAMP) structure, promote the growth of bone as well as soft tissue.  The project will result in new TAMP compositions and establish their potential for the regeneration of damaged dentin and pulp tissue to cure DH. The selected TAMP powders that comprise of interconnected nano-macro porosity, which can be tailored to desired surface area, have the unique potential to cure the problem at its source. Consequently, when placed inside the body, a TAMP powder of appropriate composition can supply therapeutic ions in a controlled manner, providing a microenvironment that is expected to occlude dentin tubules to stop the painful symptoms more effectively than currently available products. More importantly, the new TAMP powders are also expected to stimulate tissue regeneration by the cells for a lasting cure. In contrast, the present products in this market space, available over the counter or by prescription, make no attempt to regenerate damaged tissue.  

The project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. A simple TAMP powder based on calcium silicate has shown proliferation of bone forming cells in laboratory tests and also regeneration of bone and soft tissue regeneration under in vivo tests in animals. However, a demonstration of its ability to regenerate dental tissue (dentin and pulp) has been lacking. The project attempts to obtain evidence for the therapeutic capabilities of TAMP powder for dental tissue regeneration, and thereafter prepare it for clinical trials. It is also developing new compositions that combine the benefits of different treatments in one product. For example, novel TAMP powders with fluoride, zinc and potassium ions embedded within the molecular structure of silicate glass are being fabricated, to provide a lasting supply of fluoride ions at the site of DH, zinc ions that promote regeneration, and potassium ions that desensitize pain-sensing nerves. Further, tests are being performed to assess in vitro differentiation of dental pulp stem cells, and in vivo formation of pulp-dentin complex on TAMP silicates implanted in a mouse model. With this knowledge compositions are optimized for more adherent and faster developing occlusion layer as well as pulp-dentin tissue regeneration.

This technology translation from research discovery toward commercial reality is a team effort led by a glass scientist who developed the TAMP fabrication technology portfolio under prior NSF supported research, together with an endodontist with expertise in dental tissue regeneration, a cell biologist with expertise in cell response to TAMP materials, and a healthcare industry expert with experience in the early stage commercialization of biomedical products. During its course the project is directly training three graduate students in use-inspired research and practical problem-solving through a cross-disciplinary approach that combines materials engineering, cell biology and dental science. The combination of innovative TAMP technology and its potential societal impact has drawn much general student interest, which will be further expanded through more definitive results of this project.","Ukrit Thamma, Tia Kowal, Matthias Falk, Himanshu Jain~Influence of nanoporosity on the nature of hydroxyapatite formed on bioactive calcium silicate model glass~J Biomed Mater Res B Applied Biomaterials~~2018~~~https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.b.34184~0~ ~0~ ~01/03/2019 16:40:06.670000000, Tia Kowal, Natalie C.

ABSTRACT BOOK~42~2018~174~~~0~ ~0~ ~27/04/2018 22:23:52.816000000",,"A new class of bioscaffolds, ?tailored amorphous multi porous? (TAMP) silicate materials, was developed for bone tissue regeneration through prior NSF support. Customer discovery exercise showed that the lowest barrier to these TAMP materials? commercialization and entry to market was for the cure of dentin hypersensitivity, which is a pervasive pain syndrome that affects the quality of life for as much as half the global population. The currently available products have focused exclusively on the efficacy of a specific agent toward the control of pain. It will be a major advancement in the field and make broad impact if a product not only manages the pain but also cures the problem at the source such as via regeneration of eroded pulp-dentin tissue. Accordingly, the goal of this project was to determine if nano-macro porous TAMP silicates, which promote bone regeneration, can also stimulate pulp-dentin tissue regeneration. This demonstration of the potential of TAMP materials for dental applications has been pursued by combining the expertise in their fabrication (provided by the Lehigh University group that invented this technology), and in dental tissue regeneration (provided by Huang Lab at University of Tennessee Health Science Center). 
Demonstration of TAMP materials? ability to regenerate pulp-dentin tissue was undertaken at the tissue as well as the cell level using a binary calcium silicate glass as model composition. For assessment at the tissue level and obtaining direct evidence of its usefulness in dental applications, in vivo tests were conducted by implanting TAMP chips in mice and mini-swine for a period of time and then surrounding tissue was harvested and examined histologically. The results indicate that the tested TAMP silicate is acceptable to the pulp tissue and that it is biocompatible without showing any signs of toxicity. Most importantly, it induces osteodentin formation, providing the first clear evidence that TAMP silicate bioactive scaffolds can help regenerate pulp-dentin tissue. For the latter, human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) were isolated from freshly extracted permanent teeth from healthy donors and used to determine the new material?s cytotoxicity following a previous protocol for pre-osteoblast cells (that regenerate bone tissue). In contrast to in vivo tests, the in vitro tests with DPSCs showed that the material could be toxic to cells. This indication was a consequence of the fact that cytotoxicity tests were conducted under far more aggressive conditions than expected in vivo. There were also indications that odontoblasts were more sensitive than osteoblasts to the microenvironment created from the dissolution of TAMP calcium silicate under in vitro testing conditions employed here. It will be useful to develop a more relevant in vitro cytotoxicity testing protocol, if it were to be employed for predicting realistic performance of the present TAMP materials.
 In conclusion, limited in vivo tests on the selected TAMP calcium silicate composition demonstrated its pulp-dentin tissue regeneration capabilities, which make it a commercially promising candidate for the lasting treatment of dentin hypersensitivity. Further tests are needed to confirm these initial findings on the model material as well as on new TAMP formulations that have been developed under this project to provide additional function of pain reduction and enhanced tissue regeneration.

The system is called AGV-3D, and it is important because it enhances current AGV technology, which in turn improves the efficiency of U.S. manufacturing by providing a reliable and safe means of meeting material movement demands.  The project will result in an AGV-3D prototype being integrated into an actual AGV system, and demonstrated in a representative warehouse environment.  AGV-3D has the following unique features: it integrates the latest in 3D imaging technologies to enable robust and accurate localization of an AGV vehicle in a large-scale warehouse facility without the integration of wires, magnets, or reflectors in the environment. These features provide the following advantages: lower per-vehicle cost, lower facility installation cost, and increased facility flexibility when compared to the leading competing 2D laser guidance technology in this market space.  

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The first significant challenge is that the required positioning accuracy of AGVs is on the order of 1 cm.  The second is that the localization system must be extremely robust as AGV warehouse installations require very high levels of availability.  Unfortunately, correctly associating landmark features will be far more difficult as unlike current 2D laser guidance technologies, artificial retroreflector targets will not be installed in the environment.  Thus, there are significant challenges in both data association and reconstruction.   To meet these challenges, AGV-3D leverages 3D data for both mapping the environment and landmark feature segmentation.  First, a 3D reconstruction of the facility is created to extract salient natural features as landmarks.  Next, a map-based localization approach leverages 3D LIDAR to enable 3D feature-to-landmark matching which minimizes the potential for data association errors.  By employing the latest in 3D sensor systems, AGV vehicles will be able to track these 3D features in real-time.  In conjunction with the map-based localization approach, centimeter level accuracy is expected.

Unlike traditional AGV deployments which require the integration of wires, magnets, reflectors, etc., AGV-3D requires no modifications to the infrastructure.  This is made possible by leveraging the latest in three-dimensional (3D) imaging systems. These sensors provide levels of robustness and 3D performance not achievable with traditional vision systems or 2D Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) systems.  

Our team is made up of researchers from academia (Lehigh University, Kutztown University) and industry (Love Park Robotics, LLC).  Over the length of the project, we have been working closely with a lead customer who has also provided funding to support system development.  Our goal by project end was to demonstrate a system prototype in order to attract a lead customer, and we have achieved both of these goals.  In testing at a representative warehouse facility, AGV-3D demonstrated the ability for an AGV to automatically generate a map of an environment, and to localize within the map in real-time using only naturally occurring features.  Over the coming year, our team will continue refining the prototype system, with deployment of AGV-3D at customer facilities scheduled for late 2018.

In terms of professional development, this project also supported a graduate student research assistant.  This student is now working at a robotics startup in the greater Philadelphia area.

The development of the proposed soil sensors is important because they can enable the real-time, in-place monitoring of soil moisture, salinity, and nutrients in production agriculture, thus enabling precise nutrient management.  This project will result in a feasible design/prototype of an in-situ soil sensor for agricultural application. This soil sensor has the unique features that it can measure the soil properties mentioned above in real-time when deployed in an underground grid configuration with support for wireless interaction. Current sensing systems do not support continual in-situ monitoring and also require manual operation, while the proposed system is a fully-automated solution, capable of continual in-situ monitoring and wireless transport.

This project addresses technical gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application in soil sensors for agriculture. Specifically in this project, sensor prototypes, using dielectric-based moisture/salinity sensing and electrophoretic nitrate sensing packaged with signal processing and wireless capability for underground deployment, will be tested and evaluated.

In addition, personnel involved in this project, namely the two PhD students, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through soil sensor development and evaluation research, regular participation in interactions with the Iowa State Office of Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer for disclosures and patents, and further interactions with agricultural domain industries for licensing, technology transfer and commercialization.

The project engages Microwaves by the Weber, Inc. as a consultant with experience in product design, development and commercialization to augment the team's research capability, and guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.","Z.

These leg movements can be associated with a variety of medical conditions including restless leg syndrome (RLS), attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) and insomnia, which collectively affect millions of adults and children. RestEaZe is an in-home sleep monitoring product that will give the user an immediate, scientifically accurate view of quiet vs. restless sleep, and changes in sleep, over several nights along with professionally developed interactive guides for improving sleep based on the RestEaZe results. The doctor will get advanced movement and sleep analyses with interactive graphic and numeric summaries of the patient's sleep over several days. There is currently no easily used at-home way to measure PLM, GLM and sleep/leg position. 

Leg movements in sleep divide into two phenotypes: General Leg movements during Sleep (GLM) are defined by actual leg movements and periodic leg movements of Sleep (PLM) are defined by periodic dorsiflexion of the foot at the ankle. GLM patterns reveal texture and severity for sleep-behavioral intervention and in this project GLM characteristics are related to arousal risk (GLMA); PLM reveal possible medical conditions such as restless legs syndrome (RLS), cardiac morbidity and REM (rapid eye movement) behavior disorder.  PLM, GLM and GLMA along with sleep position will be used to develop metrics for PLM/hr,  sleep time, wake during sleep and  quiet vs. restless (fragmented) sleep to support evaluations and treatments.  To address this technology gap, this project is developing and commercializing a novel system, RestEaZe that identifies GLM (leg movements), PLMS (foot flexions), and leg position using a single point measurement system in a home setting. Specifically, this project combines a flexible proprietary ankle band developed at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, with proprietary PLM analytics developed at Johns Hopkins University.  RestEaZe will be an enabling technology for identifying sleep status, evaluating treatments, e.g. oral iron, behavior therapy, RLS medications, and identifying possible medical conditions.  

The graduate students involved in the project will be exposed to a start up like environment where milestones have to be met within strict time limits. They will also participate in presentations and demonstrations that the faculty researchers will have during events such as the Technology Breakfast (an event where entrepreneurs demonstrate their prototypes in Baltimore), exposing them to the world of entrepreneurship and commercialization.",,,"In this project we have developed novel technologies to produce an attractive, affordable and commercial product and service, RestEaZe translating to the home the sleep lab evaluations of restless sleep for millions of adults with insomnia and children with ADHD and RLS. An analysis of significant sleep features that should be evaluated for at-home sleep monitoring indicated that at least these should include total sleep time, brief arousals, wake during sleep, sleep efficiency, periodic leg movements in sleep and sleep position. Moreover, these need to be developed and validated for adults as well as children. The analyses indicate that sleep monitoring should be based on leg and not arm movement.

RestEaZe, for the first time ever, both phenotypes and also measures the leg movements of sleep (LMS) and using logistic regression and advanced machine learning identifies LMS characteristics that accurately predict these significant sleep measures. RestEaZe translates advanced sleep science from the lab to the home. The user gets an immediate scientifically accurate view of quiet vs. restless sleep and changes in sleep over several nights in relation to user entered sleep behavior. RestEaZe also provides professionally developed interactive guides for improving sleep based on RestEaZe results. The doctor gets advanced movement and sleep analyses with interactive graphic and numeric summaries of the patient's sleep over several days. The analyses will reveal both sleep quality, circadian pattern and PLMS. The PLMS reveal possible medical conditions such as sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome (RLS), cardiac morbidity and REM behavior disorder. We have spun off a startup company, Tanzen Medical Inc., to commercialize the product.

When image data size is no longer a restricting factor, new domains of study become possible relating the micro-scale to macro-scale, such as understanding the neural connectomics of the visual cortex. By removing the barrier of time, effort, and expertise to use large imagery, VisStore will enable scientists to scale their existing workflows. Such capability would open new investigations into fundamental biological processes, the origin and progression of diseases, and ultimately the drugs and procedures for curing them. Although initially tailored to life sciences applications, VisStore can be integrated in microscopy for new devices and emerging disciplines, such as precision medicine, material sciences and semiconductors. Furthermore, VisStore has the potential to ease the transition from current workflows to fully online cloud-based ones. Furthermore, VisStore and the hierarchical streaming infrastructure have the potential to become the de-facto standard for large volumetric images.
 
This Accelerating Innovation Technology Translation project will support R&D to build a prototype of VisStore, a plug-and-play device for easy storing, archiving, accessing, distributing, and processing massive volumetric images coming from microscopy or medical devices. It translates research discovery toward commercial applications in the microscopy market which continues to grow, topping $4.1 billion in 2014 with an anticipated CAGR growth of 7.1%, while the addressed cyber-infrastructures to reliably store, easily access, and efficiently process such data have not kept pace. This has led to a discrepancy between the quality of data that could be produced, and what actually is used, as scientists unnecessarily restrict image sizes to match computational capabilities. Brute force solutions for scaling to massive images are expensive, difficult to maintain, and require expertise usually out of reach for smaller institutions. VisStore is a combined software/hardware/cloud solution that enables ease of use for image data of any size. No more complicated than a USB drive, VisStore allows users to easily access, process, and distribute giga and terapixel 2D and 3D images within a workgroup, a company, or even globally distributed environments.
 
The technology behind VisStore enhances the state-of-the-art for handing massive image volumes. Modern software tools often stop scaling when data size exceeds main memory, and this has been a limiting factor for microscopy imagery. When dealing with image data, the hierarchical streaming software infrastructure implemented in VisStore essentially extends the memory hierarchy of a workstation to both an external network-attached hard drive (NAS), and even cloud-based storage. With each component acting as a cache, VisStore achieves performance through on-demand data access to proprietary file layout that minimizes the amount of data transferred between levels, enabling efficient scaling to images of any size. This will support development for: (i) automated ingestion and conversion of images coming from microscopy or medical devices; (ii) a simple user interface and tool to manage local and remote storage of data; and (iii) a tool to select and export data for integration with existing workflows.
 
The project engages the Moran Eye Center, the Associated Regional and University Pathologists, Inc. (ARUP) laboratories and the Oregon Health & Science University to develop and tests a prototype acquiring giga- and teravoxel images and test its commercial value to translate this technology from research discovery towards a commercial reality. In particular, the graduate and undergraduate students supported by the project will be directly involved in these entrepreneurial activities. They will cooperate directly with the early adopters of the technology at the collaborating institutions and receive hands-on experience in how to identify and resolve their pain points and ultimately translate the raw technology into a product with commercial value.","Summa, B. and Tierny, J. and Pascucci, V.~Visualizing the Uncertainty of Graph-based 2D Segmentation with Min-path Stability~Computer Graphics Forum~36~2017~~~10.1111/cgf.13174~10038400~133 to 143~10038400~OSTI~17/08/2017 21:01:53.103000000, Venkat, A. and Christensen, C. and Gyulassy, A. and Summa, B. and Federer, F. and Angelucci, A. and Pascucci, V.~A scalable cyberinfrastructure for interactive visualization of terascale microscopy data~Scientific Data Summit (NYSDS)~~2016~~~10.1109/NYSDS.2016.7747805~10038425~1 to 7~10038425~OSTI~18/08/2017 01:02:38.256000000",,"Recent advances in imaging technologies have resulted in a massive increase in high-resolution microscopy data. However, existing downstream tools to reliably store, access, and process data involve tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone workflows, often using badly scaling tools operating far beyond their design specifications. We have developed VisStore, a simple yet powerful solution to store and access virtually arbitrarily large data sets, using inexpensive hardware, a high-performance, and cache-oblivious data layout,  and lightweight software stack. VisStore acts as an inexpensive server, allowing users to interact with Terabyte sized 2D and 3D images, even from remote locations.

 

The front-end of this new system consists of a network attached storage (NAS) device, a Synology DiskStation. By connecting the NAS to the local network, users can easily direct the image capture from a microscopy device to the NAS where all images are automatically combined and converted into our fast-read fast-write proprietary streaming and multi-resolution file format. This format allows immediate read access even for partially stored datasets, enabling a user, for instance, to remotely monitor the progress of an imaging run. Our solution scales to large data without the need for expensive, high-performance disks or specialized high-bandwidth networks. Once converted, the current portion of the data acquired is immediately accessible through our server, running directly on the NAS, for interactive exploration and analysis using the ViSUS visualization platform.

 

VisStore is designed to be simple to set up and operate. To set up a new scan, the user will enter the expected resolution, the number of slices in a Z-stack, dataset name, and the path to microscope?s environment file into VisStore?s user interface (UI) and clicks Initialize Acquisition. VisStore automatically reads the remaining scan settings from the environment file and creates metadata for the new scan directly on the NAS, updates the server configuration with the new dataset information for immediate remote access to the data. The user then clicks Start Acquisition to start a new transfer and conversion session. VisStore periodically queries the staging area to determine whether new data has arrived, transfers the data to NAS, and updates the 3D model directly on the NAS. The user can visualize and explore their live scans using the ViSUS viewer (a standalone cross-platform visualization client). In addition to the basic features, VisStore allows users to pause-and-continue acquisitions, extend existing datasets with additional data and performs automated diagnostics to monitor imaging data quality during a live scan.

 

The solution developed under this project greatly reduces the pain of managing, moving, visualizing, and analyzing massive amounts of image data acquired through microscopy. This will reduce the time domain scientists waste performing menial tasks associated with data management, accelerating the process of scientific discovery. Furthermore, the subsequent commercial release of the system will broaden the impact of the technology by making it accessible not only to scientists, but also commercial ventures, such as in engineering, design, and pharmaceuticals.

These features provide the following advantages when compared to the leading competing algae cultivation and harvesting technologies in this market space: 1) ability to cultivate algae monocultures in a ""dirty"" environment like wastewater, while utilizing freely-available carbon, nutrients and water; 2) ability to grow multiple algal species separately but within the same feedstock tank; 3) enabling multiple simultaneous use of existing infrastructure at a wastewater treatment facility, thereby accelerating process intensification; 4) production of dense cultures which passively dewater, thereby greatly reducing the costs of harvesting and downstream processing.

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) geometric considerations for scaling up reactor volume; 2) strategy for linking multiple pods into an interconnected ICARUS system; 3) process control for a linked system; 4) large-volume algal growth kinetics and productivity; 5) long-term membrane performance.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a post-doc, a PhD student, and two undergraduate students, will receive training on entrepreneurship, intellectual property and commercialization, digital 3D design, process scaling, algal biology, wastewater process design and modeling, and membrane science.

This integrated microfluidic platform is important due to the direct impact on cancer patients and supporting infrastructure resulting from bringing this game-changing microfluidic device to market. Patient diagnosis and monitoring would become simpler, cheaper, faster, and more convenient. Moreover, the usage of this microfluidic platform is not limited to cancer diagnosis, but extends to any disease or condition measured via changes in cellular physical properties in a sample of biological fluid.

We spiked beads at three different concentrations of, 1,000, 10,000 and 25,000 cell/mL. High separation efficiency of beads is achieved using the iMF chip at the flow conditions mentioned earlier (Fig. 1). No beads are lost in Outlet 1 or Outlet 3 of the parallel array chip. Our results show that at CTC separation is not affected at lower dilution of 3&times; or 5&times;.  With lower blood dilution RBC removal efficiency gets reduced. This is due to particle-particle interaction at higher concentration of RBC, which flow into the ""CTC"" outlet.  As a result, Enrichment ratio of the collected sample from Outlet 2 also reduces at lower concentrations of beads/mL (Fig. 2). 

 

Broader Impact: Under this project, Graduate Student Researcher Neha Garg received IRB approval for the usage and handling of bloodsamples from healthy blood donors. This approval allows us to use whole blood samples in our experiments to realisticallytest the device. In addition, all the researchers were required to complete the blood safety training under EH&amp;S at UCI. All researchers Neha Garg, and Prithviraj Mukherjee gave presentations to the industrial partner Frank Narz at Qiagen, gaining experience in monthly teleconferences.

The adaptive growing rod is important because of its potential to reduce the high incidence of implant loosening and failure, which are the primary sources of complications in the treatment of severe early-onset scoliosis in children and often necessitate costly and painful revision surgeries.  The project will result in a working prototype of an adaptive growing rod and demonstrate its feasibility in a standardized biomechanics model. This device has the unique features of simultaneous high strength and ultra-low stiffness matching that of human bone, and the ability to vary its stiffness depending on location.   When compared to the leading competing growing rods based on the Harrington rods system in this market, these features reduce the number of revision procedures required by reducing a leading source of complications, facilitating healthy development of the spine from better load sharing, and improving the overall efficacy for treatment of severe scoliosis in children.  

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: there is a current lack of quantitative understanding of how stress at the bone-screw interface is affected by implant stiffness in growing rod constructs.  This is important because high stress at the bone-screw interface is believed to be responsible for implant loosening and pull-outs.  Furthermore, it is not known how location-dependent implant stiffness modifies such stress.  The project seeks to bridge these gaps by quantitatively monitoring how stress at the bone-screw interface is affected by variations in the implant stiffness introduced by microstructural engineering and thermo-mechanical training in a Ti-Nb alloy.  Experiments are performed using a modified ASTM standard model that accounts for the changing stiffness of the growing spine.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a Ph.D. level graduate student and undergraduate researchers, will receive entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through direct involvement in the customer development process.  Students will participate in all conversations with surgeons, hospital officials, regulatory personnel, and medical devices manufacturers.  Students will be asked to make customer contacts independently, and receive training of the lean-startup strategy central to the NSF I-Corps program.    

The project engages pediatric orthopedic surgeons and a medical devices manufacturer to ensure a clear and current understanding of clinical needs and challenges, as well as regulatory and reimbursement hurdles of this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.",,,"The primary, and most significant outcomes of this NSF AIR/TT project are a pair of medical implant devices that will potentially reduce the incidence of post-surgical complications in the treatment of degenerative disk diseases and scoliosis.  Both of these implants are currently being commercialized and awaiting FDA 510k clearance; it is expected that both devices will be on the market before the end of 2019.  The AIR/TT project helped to build the technical foundation for these products, generated lab-bench valildation, and established the entrepreneurial training and knowledge that eventually led to the commercialization efforts.
The first of the two device is a spinal rod device designed to address the problems of screw loosening during the treatment of early-onset scoliosis in young child and adjancet-level complications in the treatment of adult scoliosis.  The proposed solution to this problem utilizes a newly-developed Ti-Nb alloy funded by a previous NSF basic science project.  A key distinguishing characteristic of the alloy is that it possess a tune-able elastic modulus between 20-110 GPa while maintaining a high strength as expected from metallic alloys.  Modification of the elastic modulus through heat treatments performed prior to the final machining and surface finishing steps, which we call ""training"", can be performed on local regions in a device, such that the stiffness of a Ti-Nb rod could be varied from by location, allowing implants with flexible ends and rigid mid-span, or vice versa, to be engineered in order to satisfy the conflicting requirements of flexibility and rigidity.  Specifically for pedicle screw systems, reduced stiffness toward the ends of the rod, near the pedicle screw regions, allows for reduced stress at the bone-screw anchor and at the adjacent segments, while higher stiffness toward the mid-span maintains the rigidity needed for proper fixation. The Ti-Nb alloy is known to be biocompatible and does not cause inflammatory response.  We have shown through modified ASTM standardized testing that using a location-varied stiffness rod reduces the stresses on the vertebrae by over 65% compared to a standard titanium rod.  This significant reduction in adverse stress is expected to reduce the incidence of screw loosening and undesirable bone remodeling that begets a host of post-surgical complications. 
A second device made from the materials technology studied in the project is a spinal interbody device with tunable stiffness to match patient-specific differences in the bone quality and expected implant loads.  With the Ti-Nb alloy, we created an interbody device that could change stiffness by over 200% by changing processing conditions without changing the material compositions or the geometry of the implant.  The strength is not significantly impacted by the change of stiffness, and the process of stiffness control can be applied on an individual device level.   The operating principles of the stiffness control is very similar to that used for the aforementioned rod device.  This technology is expected to improve load sharing between implant and bone, and reduce the incidence of subsidence where the implant sinks into the surface of the vertebral end plate. 
 The intellectual merit of the project is achieving the ability to tailor the elastic properties of the material by controlled precipitation of second-phase nanoparticles through aging heat treatments.  The project advanced knowledge in two specific areas:  1) Identify and quantify the effect of aging temperature and duration on the initial and strain-dependent elastic moduli of Ti-Nb alloys, and 2) Identify and quantify the effect of these variations on the stress state experienced by the spine.  The work produced processing parameters that overcome the technical barrier of obtaining the desired strain-dependent moduli response, followed by the fabrication of the working prototype device.
In terms of broader impact, the proposed project led to the introduction of a new type of spine implant that improves the outcome of adult and pediatric scoliosis, and degenerative disk diseases.  A prototype of the device was successfully demonstrated and subsequent interactions with industrial partnerss have led to 1) initiation of testing necessary for obtaining FDA clearance, 2) formation of academic-industry collaborations , 3) start of early-stage fund-raising efforts, 4) creation of licensing agreements, and 5) establishment of independent start-up company to market the product. Additionally, the project has also provided entrepreneurial training to both graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the faculty involved.

The developed sensor is important because it can enable automation in a number of industrial and mobile machines.  The project will result in a robust prototype of a piston position measurement sensor. The proposed sensor will be non-contacting, non-intrusive, inexpensive, will not require line-of-sight access, and will involve minimal effort for installation on a cylinder.  Due to these advantages, the proposed sensor has an opportunity to establish a significant market share in the piston position application domain. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery towards commercial applications:
    a)	The need to place the sensor at an off-axis location on top of the actuator requires the development and use of complex two-dimensional magnetic field models.
    b)	The sensor prototype needs to address problems due to hysteresis when the cylinder is made of soft steel which gets magnetized and demagnetized in real time due to oscillatory motion of a magnet.
    c)	Extension of the previous linear position sensor technology to rotational applications requires new sensor architectures, development of new models, and new estimation algorithms.

Specific solutions to address the above challenges will be fully developed and evaluated in the project.  The proposed solutions include development of analytical two-dimensional magnetic field models, development of a new analytical model for hysteresis that has significant advantages over the traditional Preisach model, and development of robust auto-calibration algorithms. In addition, a graduate student and a post-doc involved in the project will receive technology translation experience through prototype development and industrial interaction.

The advantages of the developed system are its low cost, durability due to non-contacting operation, and low installation effort.  The fundamental technologies (or intellectual merit contributions) that enable this new position estimation system are nonlinear magnetic field models, nonlinear estimation algorithms and an automatic disturbance compensation system.

 

The new position measurement (estimation) system can enable automation and health monitoring in construction, agriculture and manufacturing applications.  The ability to inexpensively measure position in hydraulic and pneumatic actuators can automate tasks and reduce operator burden in many agricultural and construction vehicles.  These systems can also provide for more accurate and automated operation of machines in packaging and manufacturing operations on industrial machines.

 

The estimated market size for position sensors for the agriculture, construction and industrial sectors is estimated to be $500 million annually.  A market penetration of even 1% could yield significant revenues for a start-up company focused on sales of such position sensors to original equipment manufacturers.  Hence, negotiations with the University of Minnesota for licensing the technology were finalized and a start-up company, Innotronics LLC, focused on commercializing the developed sensors is in operation.

 

The broader impact outcomes of this project include possible success of a start-up company leading to growth in revenues and employment at the company, education and full support of one Ph.D. student and partial support of another Ph.D. student, support of three undergraduate students to conduct research, publication of refereed research articles, filing of one new patent application, and outreach to a number of OEM companies that utilize hydraulic and pneumatic actuators in their industrial and off-road vehicle products.

In structural applications that are critical, such as aerospace, automotive, and hard-tissue replacements, metals are typically used. Forming of metals, however, has been limited. This project will combine metal-like properties and plastic-like processing. Particularly, thermoplastic based blow-molding and stretch blow-molding, will be translated during this project from a scientific discovery into a technological process, which can meet the need for a metal net-shape process.  These blow-molding processes have potentially vast commercial ramification as they could replace many of the currently used metal processing methods, and hence replace many of the applications currently occupied by metals and plastics. In order to reach such a translation, this project will determine processing parameters that are required for a commercial fabrication process. In addition, a commercial viability study will be carried out considering capital investment, processing time, and materials costs. As a product, a commercial apparatus and processing procedure will be determined in consultation with equipment manufacturers. Specifically, cycle time will be minimized, and processing conditions optimized for speed, energy efficiency, and robustness. Considering the redundancy of machining, joining, and other finishing procedures, and taking into account the processing speed and accuracy, blow-molding of metallic glasses is envisioned to replace currently used materials and processes used for electronic casings.
 
This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The effect of high strain rate on the deformation behavior is not well understood. Particularly, if the metallic glass forming liquid remains to behave like a Newtonian liquid as strain rates exceeding 0.1/sec. Accurate understanding of the deformation behavior, the metallic glasses' response to temperature and pressure is crucial for future modeling of mold filling during blow-molding and stretch blow-molding.  How the high strain rates effects the mechanical properties of the metallic glass also will be investigated. Bending experiments will be conducted and the strain to failure will be used as a quantitative measure for bending ductility. 

Involved personnel include graduate students, post-docs, undergraduate students, and visiting undergraduate students. They will be exposed to the whole range of technological development; from fundamental science of determining the deformation behavior, to engineering aspects of developing appropriate processes and machinery, to commercial and business aspects of viability and comparison studies. Students will be exposed to the state of the art metallurgy processes and characterization methods and will also develop a deeper understanding of the connection between science, innovation, and entrepreneurial skills.",,,"This project focuses on translating the ability to thermoplastically form metallic glasses like plastics to fill the need of net-shaping metals.

In structural applications that are critical, such as aerospace, automotive, and hard-tissue replacements, metals are typically used. Forming of metals, however, has been limited. This project combined metal-like properties and plastic-like processing. This was achieved through exploring stretch-blowmolding. Blowmolding have been previously demonstrated for metallic glasses as an effective forming method. However, the highly non-uniform thickness distribution limits the shapes that can be blowmolded to below ~100% strain. To lift this limitation, we propose to first stretch the feedstock mechanically into the mold cavity, and subsequently blow mold to replicate even complex, and high-strain requiring, shapes. Within this project a stretch-blowmolding machine was designed and built. With this machine, we carried out research on the wall thickness variation. We found that stretching alone is insufficient to result in low wall thickness variation. However, when different temperatures are applied in the center and edges of the feedstock, relatively uniform wall thickness can be achieved.

To demonstrate this capability, we formed a complex shape from a flat, sheet-like feedstock, into a complex shape, requiring more than 1000% strain.

The ability to net-shape even most complex shapes through this highly energy and cost-efficient process suggest a wide commercial adaptation of this process. However, as today?s most practical metallic glasses, that are suited for thermoplastic forming, are relatively expensive, early adapters of this technology will be in applications that can tolerate higher costs for better performance.  A wide spread use of this technology will need, in addition of the outcome of this project, require the development of inexpensive metallic glasses.

The new process is an order of magnitude better in energy cost than current practices, and also emits well below half the carbon dioxide (CO2) of the most efficient existing metallurgical processes. The goal of the project is to generate the necessary process data to evaluate scalability and cost-effectiveness of this solid-oxide-membrane-based green electrolytic process for semiconductor and solar grade silicon production. Upon successful implementation, this process will demonstrate several advantages over current processes. They include: very low energy usage relative to free energy required for silicon dioxide (SiO2) reduction; use of inexpensive raw materials that require little to no pre-treatment; no carbothermic reduction, which emits 10 kg of CO2 per kg silicon (Si) product and whose contaminants typically reduce purity of silicon from 99.6% in natural quartzite to 97-98% in metallurgical grade (MG) Si; possibility of inherent boron removal by borium triflouride (BF3) volatilization; absence of any carbon or chlorine in the process; and there are no anode effects resulting in perfluro and/or perchloro carbon emissions. 

Current methods for Si production include, fluidized bed reduction processes, carbothermic reduction of high-purity silica, slag/crystal refining, liquid Si electrorefining, and electrolysis of chlorides and fluorides. Some of the major limitations of these processes include extensive raw materials pre-processing, low yields, detrimental environmental impact and substantial energy requirements. In the proposed process, a one-end-closed oxygen-ion-conducting stabilized zirconia (SOM) tube will be used to separate pure silica (SiO2) dissolved in molten flux from an inert anode placed inside the SOM tube. To ensure product purity, a pre-reduction step using a secondary cathode at lower applied potentials will be employed to remove impurities that are more electronegative than Si. The impurity-laden secondary cathode will be removed, and then employing a liquid tin cathode the applied potential will be increased to reduce silica. The Si reduced will go into solution in the liquid tin cathode. Less electronegative impurity ions compared to Si will remain in the flux. Thus impurity oxides of both more and less electronegative impurities are not reduced along with silica. Si is over 95 atom% soluble in liquid tin at high temperatures but at lower temperatures pure Si and Sn are immiscible. This will allow directional solidification to be employed after electrolysis to produce high-purity Si ingots and demonstrate this as a cost-effective carbon-free method for mass production of Si from commercially available sources of silica. This project will provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to work with our industrial partners and move the technology closer towards commercialization. It will also provide a rich set of case-study materials for introduction into both undergraduate and graduate classroom teaching.

The Siemens process is inherently complex, capital and energy-intensive (300 kWh/kg Si), unsafe, and has a negative environmental impact. In response to these challenges, research on direct electrolysis of silica dissolved in molten salt has received great attention as a process for solar-grade silicon production. If successful, molten salt electrolysis of silica could achieve lower energy use (&lt;25 kWh/kg, &gt;90% reduction), lower cost (&lt;$2/kg, &gt;80% reduction), and easier scalability similar to the Hall-Heroult process that produces most of the aluminum through electrolysis of alumina or bauxite dissolved in molten salt. However, past attempts on molten salt silica electrolysis have faltered due to high SiCl4 and SiF4 volatility, low salt-bath conductivity, high salt-bath viscosity, low silica solubility, contamination by anode impurities, and salt trapping in the product. Our research on this project has brought this technology closer to commercialization by engineering a unique molten salt bath based on the MgF2-CaF2-YF3-CaO-SiO2 system that has solved five of the six above mentioned challenges. The novel salt composition has low volatility &lt;0.1 &mu;g/cm2-s, low viscosity &lt;5 mPa-s, high ionic conductivity &gt;4 S/cm, high SiO2 solubility &gt;5 wt%, and excellent chemical compatibility with the zirconia-based solid oxide membrane (SOM) inert anode - an order of magnitude better on all metrics than any other prior work. The work has resulted in one issued patent, a publication and two PhD theses.

Broader Impacts: Electrolysis of oxides dissolved in molten salts employing zirconia-based solid oxide membrane (SOM) inert anode is a universal process for metals production. Demonstration of process feasibility and scale-up potential can transform the metals industry. It is significantly better in energy cost than current best practice, and in addition has little to no emission of chloro-and-fluoro hydrocarbons. The findings of this research project are applicable to other metals. This project has provided research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to work with industry and National Laboratories. Two PhD students have completed their thesis research on this project. In addition, the research work has provided a rich set of case-study materials for introduction into both undergraduate and graduate classroom teaching in the area of Green Manufacturing.

The translated technology offers reliable pressure recordings in real-time for patients suffering from chronic, often life-long medical conditions for which elevated pressure is a risk factor or indicator, and removes the need for bulky exterior diagnostic tools. The microbubble pressure sensor has the following unique features: biocompatible construction, small footprint (less than 0.1 sq. mm.), wireless control and power, and a microbubble transduction mechanism. The microbubble transduction mechanism circumvents failures modes such as mechanical fatigue and biofouling, which plague sensors that rely on deflection in elastic membranes. These features provide for an unobtrusive, reliable implant, with greater application to chronic in vivo monitoring compared to current state-of-the-art in physiological pressure monitoring. The project will result in a working prototype pressure sensor and critical data to de-risk on-going development. 

This project addresses current technology gaps by integrating wireless circuitry for power and telemetry into the existing prototype microbubble transducer and by generating critical characterization data on long term accuracy, precision and repeatability, as necessary steps for translating the technology toward commercial deployment. Graduate and undergraduate researchers will work to finalize device electronics and packaging and calibrate the prototype pressure sensor with thorough benchtop testing. In addition, all personnel involved in this project, will benefit from translational education programs offered by our I-Corps node and Coulter workshop series that will expose them to customer discovery, customer interviews, Lean Startup methodology, medical device commercialization, and regulatory and reimbursement strategy. 

The team is collaborating with neurosurgeons at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles; they will provide guidance in design and deployment of biomedical technologies for hydrocephalus.  The team will also leverage industry connections and technology commercialization programs for guidance and training on commercialization, manufacturing, and financing as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology into a competitive commercial reality.  The potential economic and societal impact of this project include greater US competitiveness in biomedical sensing technology, and the improvements in healthcare quality and reductions in healthcare cost realized by new clinical pressure sensors, that offer data driven diagnostics and timely medical interventions for chronically suffering patients.",Eugene Yoon and Ellis Meng~Electrolytic Generation of Trapped Nanobubbles via Nucleation Core with Picoliter Precision~33rd IEEE International Conference on Microelectromechanical Systems~~2020~~~~0~ ~0~ ~27/01/2020 00:58:09.836000000,,"Main project outcomes are new knowledge related to electrochemical theory applied to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. The multi-disciplinary approach to merge two distinct fields yielded significant improvements in electrolytically generated bubble-based pressure sensing technology. First order approximations from proof-of-concept experiments were refined across 3 device design iterations to achieve bubble volume precision on the picoliter scale, power savings up to 44%, a new pressure sensing mechanism with 0.5 mmHg resolution (10  improvement over previous work), and temporal bubble stability up to 500 minutes (25  improvement over previous work). This work provided research and project management experience to graduate and undergraduate students and also enabled the collaboration of visiting professor from Kansai University, Japan.  The graduate student also disseminated findings through a conference and engaged in technology commercialization pitch competitions.

 

Broader impacts stemming from these intellectual achievements include the potential for developing a smart microsensing platform technology for remote monitoring of patients suffering from diseases where physiological pressure is improperly regulated.  Conditions such as hydrocephalus, glaucoma, or hypertension are potential therapeutic areas which may benefit from the outcomes of this technology. Treatment of such diseases have traditionally been complicated and costly due to the lack of methods to continuously and reliably monitor pressure. This is because standard pressure sensing technology is incompatible with wet and biological environments. However, this work harnesses micromachining technology in a form factor that inherently harnesses liquid systems. Such devices may later guide evidence-based treatment to improve quality of care while reducing cost of healthcare which may ultimately contribute to US competitiveness in biomedical innovation.

The fiber-coupled miniature multiphoton microscope is important because it allows neuroscientists an unprecedented ability to study dynamics of complex neuronal circuits while animals are undergoing different behavior tasks.  The project will result in a proof-of-concept demonstration of our product operating in freely moving animals.  The fiber-coupled miniature multiphoton microscope will allow full three-dimensional scanning through active focusing with no mechanically moving parts in a compact, light weight design.  The product can be readily connected to a commercial-laser scanning microscope. These features allow for reduced cost, flexibility in configuration of the wavelength or imaging modality to be performed, and can provide imaging over larger brain volumes when compared to the leading head-mounted microscope systems in this market space.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  Although light microscopy has rapidly advanced for studies of biological systems, one major gap is the ability to use these advanced imaging tools for dynamic studies in the brain in freely moving animals.  We propose to combine the advantages of two-photon excitation with depth scanning using adaptive optics in a compact fiber-coupled design.  Current commercially available miniature microscopes only allow for single imaging planes, do not enable active focusing during imaging and do not allow both targeted imaging and optogenetic stimulation. The miniature multiphoton fiber-coupled microscope will use a fiber-bundle to translate the laser-scanned signal to the distal microscope head and miniature adaptable optical elements to provide fast active focusing. This will accomplish high versatility for applications such as fast region-of-interest imaging, optogenetic stimulation, and depth imaging with multiphoton techniques. Personnel involved in this project including undergraduate and graduate students, will receive experience in technology translation through meetings with business partners, attending technology conferences, and participating in outreach events.

To date, the complexity of the network?s interactions has inhibited the formation of a theoretical framework. Further advances in neuroscience will rely on technologies enabling studies, in diverse species, of long-range interactions of neurons, spanning individual-individual interactions to emergent or large group level network analysis. Importantly, these advances require development of affordable cutting-edge technology to record and modulate neuronal activity in multiple brain areas.

The goal of this project was to optimize and disseminate a technology developed through an NSF IDBR (Instrument Development for Biological Research) Grant, DBI-1353757, for a miniature fiber coupled multiphoton microscope using an adaptive electrowetting lens.  The technology can achieve optical recording and optogenetic neuromodulation for use in studies in freely moving animals and opens up new opportunities to study brain networks during behavior.

The major outcomes are:

1.  The project led to the development of a compact miniature two-photon fiber-coupled microscope (2P-FCM) to be easily integrated on any commercial multiphoton microscope system.  This allows the technology to be distributed as an inexpensive add-on to current microscope systems to allow freely moving animal imaging. 

2.  The project led to the first successful demonstration of the 2P-FCM with a tunable focus electrowetting lens for three-dimensional in vivo two-photon imaging of neural activity.

3.  Software was developed for image correction and removing pixelation through the fiber.  The software is described in an open access publication (Ozbay et al., Scientific Reports 2018) and is freely available.

4.  The project connected university researchers with a local small business to take an idea from its conception into a real commercial product for wide dissemination.  The technology optimized under this grant will continue towards commercialization through a Small Business Innovation Research grant that was recently awarded to the commercial partners, with potential for local job creation.

5.  The students involved in the project gained experience in technology transfer and the commercialization process that can assist them in future career opportunities.  In fact, one of the students graduated and has taken an industry position with our small business partner.

6.  The project promoted science and engineering to the general public through laboratory tours for 50 high school girls for the annual Girl?s Career Day (sponsored by University of Colorado Center for Women's Health Research) and through lab tours for high school students run by the University of Colorado Science Discovery Program. 

7.  The project provided research and training opportunities for two graduate students and four undergraduate students including one veteran and two from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.

For over 50 years, it is has been common practice in the agricultural industry to add low doses of traditional (i.e., ""medically important"") antibiotics to animal feed to improve production efficiency of food animals. While these ""antibiotic growth promoters"" provide tremendous economic benefit, this practice also leads to antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains which have the potential to infect humans. As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration has implemented measures to stop this practice. While numerous alternatives to medically important antibiotics have been proposed, most have not been commercially successful as they are not adequately effective. As an alternative to medically important antibiotics, the use of antimicrobial proteins has great promise, but a significant limitation to their commercial production has been cost. Thus the ability to economically manufacture antimicrobial proteins would represent a significant benefit to the agricultural industry as it would allow farmers to maintain high levels of productivity while not generating antibiotic-resistant strains that pose a danger to humans. This proposal explores the potential of replacing medically-important antibiotic feed-additives with antimicrobial protein (AMP). Work described here seeks to generate proof-of-concept data, expressing model AMPs, at commercially viable titers, using recombinant filamentous fungi.

This project employs a commercially-relevant fungal species (Aspergillus niger), to express model endolysin proteins with demonstrated bactericidal activity. To increase both expression and extracellular secretion of two different endolysin enzymes several approaches will be used, exploring the impact of genomic location, transcriptional promoter, and secretion signal sequence. Employing several approaches will increase the likelihood for success and will also allow identification of the most relevant factors leading to a high-producing recombinant fungal strain. This understanding will allow efficient generation of additional production strains for different proteins or peptides. In addition, personnel involved in this project, both a postdoctoral scientist and several undergraduate students, will be trained in a cross-disciplinary environment that will increase their research capacity. Personnel will also participate in entrepreneurial education experiences, through conducting customer discovery activities related to this project. This will primarily involve contacting potential stakeholders, along the entire value chain, to test hypotheses related to future commercialization.","Karthik R.

These antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) provide an economic advantage for the agricultural industry as they allow an animal to grow to a given final weight, while consuming less feed. Prevalent use of AGP at low doses is one of the major causes for the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria around the globe.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that every year more than two million people in the United States get antibiotic resistant infections and at least 23,000 people die as a result.  Studies have estimated that in the United States alone, antibiotic resistance adds $20 billion in excess direct health care costs, with additional costs to society for lost productivity as high as $35 billion a year.

Our goal is to economically produce an effective alternative to AGP. Recently, we have been testing an antibacterial protein we think can replace AGP in poultry feed.  We have demonstrated that this protein kills a species of bacteria which causes necrotic enteritis in chickens, and costs poultry farmers approximately $6 billion dollars annually. The challenge has been to produce this protein in a cost effective manner. One way to accomplish this is to utilize a microbe used in the biotechnology industry (i.e., Aspergillus niger) to make commodity chemicals and protein.  We used biotechnology methods to put the gene for our antibacterial protein into Aspergillus niger and we are currently studying how the protein is being produced. Once we are able to produce this antibacterial protein at high quantities, we will then conduct experiments where we feed it to poultry to test it's ability to replace AGP.

This project was focused on investigating new methods to reduce the cost, weight and volume of onboard power electronics for next generation of plug-in electric vehicles. This research led to the investigation, design, and development of a proof of concept power electronic interfaces that integrated an onboard charger with the step-down dc/dc auxiliary power module for electric vehicles.

 

Outcomes of this project were two prototypes for aimed at integrating an onboard charger and auxiliary power module for electric vehicles: (i) a 3.3kW proof of concept utilizing a CLLLC converter intertwined with a LLC converter; and (ii)  a 600W proof of concept using a triple-active-bridge converter. According to the experimental measurements, the CLLLC structure and triple-active-bridge structures demonstrated peak efficiencies of 96.7% and 97.6%, correspondingly. It was shown that the triple-active-bridge topology is a more suitable candidate due to capability of providing power flow between different ports with enough control flexibility. This work led to one provisional patent, one PCT application, many presentations, several journal publications and supported two Ph.D. dissertations. In addition, it provided research opportunity to undergraduate students. Two of the graduate students working on this projects are now currently pursuing successful careers in automotive (specifically electric vehicles) industry.

The novel drug 3D nanoprinting process, developed at the NSF Center for High Rate Nanomanufacturing, is important because it will enable oral administration of various promising drug candidates that currently can only be given intravenously. This will increase patient compliance and decrease the time and cost involved in therapy, while enhancing drug safety from the development-to-patient process. The project will result in a proof-of-concept for an entirely new drug nanoprinting technology for controlled and effective delivery of poorly soluble drugs via oral administration. 

This technology has the following unique features. The research will print drug-loaded polymeric micelles into 100nm or smaller size nanorods with well-defined shapes. The precise control of the size and shape of the nanorods will provide a sufficiently high and fixed drug dosage in the blood to get a desired therapeutic response. The 3-D drug-loaded nanorods will be embedded into a unique polymer that can only dissolve at a specific basic pH that can be chosen based on the desired location for the drug release in the body. For example, the drug nanorods can be released in the intestine after passing through the stomach, and this also eliminates the stability issue due to pH variation in the GI track. Due to their small size, these nanorods will have a high permeability, thus enabling effective transport through the intestinal wall as compared to spheres or other shapes. In addition, the drug nanorods are expected to penetrate tumors more efficiently and much faster than spherical drug nanoparticles. This should lead to a better bioavailability of the drug with reduced toxicity and side effects. The printing technique will also enable the preparation of multi-drug nanorods, where the nanorods can be composed of several poorly soluble drugs to overcome multi-drug resistance. These features will enable effective intracellular penetration through the intestine and controlled oral administration of poorly soluble drugs when compared to drugs such as micellar paclitaxel and free paclitaxel in this market space. 

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Various sub 100nm diameter nanorods will be characterized for their in vitro permeability to develop a fundamental understanding of the effect of nanorod size and aspect ratio on the cell penetration. The proposed research will evaluate and characterize in vitro cytotoxicity of the printed drug-loaded micellar nanorods in cancer cells to determine the sufficiently high level of these drugs in the blood to get a desired therapeutic response. The research will also investigate the effect of size and shape of the nanorods on internalization by the cancer cells. In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduates and graduates students, will receive innovation, educational and entrepreneurial experiences through interaction with pharmaceutical companies, mentoring sessions, and entrepreneurship courses provided at Northeastern University.","C.

Overview:  

More than 40% new chemical entities and anti-cancer agents are poorly water-soluble. Therefore, many of the promising drug candidates are left on the shelf because they prove to be difficult to solubilize. This results in billions of dollars loss to pharmaceutical companies. To practically use these drugs, one has to develop dosage forms, which can be soluble in water and provide a sufficiently high level of these drugs in the blood to obtain a desired therapeutic response. Usually, these dosage forms can only be administered intravenously. However, intravenous formulations of NPs are associated with high toxicity due to the dose and interaction with the normal healthy tissues. In addition, the intravenous route has poor patient compliance, painful, costly and a risky route of administration within the geriatric population. This project developed a process that enables oral preparation of poorly soluble anti-cancer drugs that will allow for the delivery of drug in the blood. The drug nano rods are prepared using nanoscale printing and have various advantages over i.v. administration. Oral administration will enhance patient compliance; reduce cost and time involved in treatment. In addition, owing to their nanoscale size, larger surface area and controlled shape, these drugs will provide a sufficiently high and fixed drug dosage in the blood, enabling a better bioavailability with minimum toxicity and side effect. The project developed an entirely new drug nanomanufacturing technology that will allow oral administration of poorly soluble drugs by assembling drug-loaded polymeric micelles into sub 100nm orally acceptable nano rods using unique directed assembly and nanoprinting approach developed by the NSF Science and Engineering Center for High-rate Nanomanufacturing.

Intellectual Merit: 

The project resulted in the development and characterization of novel micellar-based nano rods containing poorly soluble drugs for delivery into the blood from the intestine with subsequent tumor targeting. Drug-loaded polymeric micelles are printed into sub 100nm size nano rods with well-defined shape to enable effective intracellular penetration through intestine and controlled oral administration of poorly soluble drugs. PTX, a water insoluble drug, was successfully encapsulated into the micelle formulations. We have demonstrated that the produced micelles can be assembled into 3-D nano rods down to 50nm diameter with an aspect ratio of 3. We have studied the effect of assembly parameters on the nano rod formation and obtained nanorods with controlled shape and size. In addition, we demonstrated that fabricated drug-loaded nano rods can be harvested from the substrate for in-vitro cell studies.

Broader Impacts: 

The proposed research enabled oral administration of various promising drug candidates that are currently given intravenously. This is a significant breakthrough for the pharmaceutical industry. The outcome of the research will be of great benefit for both patients and clinicians. The new drug delivery systems will increase patient compliance and decrease the time and cost involved in therapy, while enhancing drug safety from the development-to-patient process. Because of the applicability to various poorly soluble drugs, this technology could potentially make a significant commercial impact, thereby creating jobs for a diverse and globally competitive workforce. Beyond transformative research, the proposed project effort will have a broad educational impact in science, technology and society. It brought together undergraduate and graduate students from different disciplines (engineering and pharmacy) to advance interdisciplinary work and revolutionize technologies in the area of drug development and therapeutics.

The project will result in the development of a prototype system consisting of a UAV and a ground station with associated software that can provide the firefighting ""Incident Management Teams"" with advanced situational awareness capabilities during wildfire and structural fire scenarios. This UAV based system has the following unique features: i) ease-of-use by firefighting professionals in managing UAV operations; ii) quick deployment; and iii) real-time acquisition and processing of information gathered by UAV in order to provide not only a current situational picture but also predictive ability in case of wildfires. These features provide advantages including reduced cost of operation and improved safety of lives and properties as compared with current methodologies such as manned aircraft based surveillance, satellite imageries, and manual lookout practices.   

This project addresses a number of technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. For example, the conversion of data gathered from UAVs in the form of telemetry and streaming video into an intuitive form easily understandable by firefighters requires innovations in real-time video processing, spatio-temporal estimation, systematic combination of information from multiple sources, and information presentation and visualization. Similarly, intended use by firefighting professionals, who are not trained pilots, and other practical constraints require the UAV operations to be autonomous and algorithms to be computationally efficient.

The project engages partners from the University of Toledo Technology Transfer Office, Kayos Enterprise, Inc., West Virginia Division of Forestry, and the Cincinnati Fire Department to guide the commercialization process, augment the research capability, provide a testing environment, and offer an understanding of users' needs and perspectives in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.

The proposed UAV based technology is important because it puts tools in hands of wildfire and structural fire incident commanders so they can obtain improved situational awareness for making timely and informed decisions. This is expected to result in substantial cost savings, improved levels of safety, lower loss of life and property, and augmented preservation of the environment. With the imminent inclusion of UAVs in the national airspace, the technologies developed in this research have wide potential in a number of other civilian applications such as law enforcement, border patrol, and perimeter surveillance. This project provides training to future engineers, incident commanders, UAV operators and entrepreneurs who would lead this field of technology in years to come. In addition, the project will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the area of civilian UAV applications with potential economic impact within five to ten years.","Kukreti, S., Kumar, M., and Cohen, K.~Detection and Localization using Unmanned Aerial Systems for Firefighting Applications~AIAA Infotech @ Aerospace, AIAA Science and Technology Forum~~2016~2016-1903~~~0~ ~0~ ~01/06/2016 00:54:40.246000000, Sathyan, A., Cohen, K., and Kumar, M.~Image Processing and Localization for Detecting and Tracking Wildland Fires~ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference~~2015~DSCC2015-~~~0~ ~0~ ~14/03/2017 13:07:44.106000000, Nemati, A., Soni, N., Sarim, M., and Kumar, M.~Design, Fabrication, and Control of a Tilt Rotor Quadcopter: Theory and Experiments~ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference~~2016~~~~0~ ~0~ ~14/03/2017 13:07:44.76000000, Cohen, J., Sathyan, A., and Kumar, M.~MatConvNet-based Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of Humans from Infrared Images~International Journal of Unmanned Systems Engineering~4~2016~~~~0~ ~0~ ~14/03/2017 13:07:44.56000000, Radmanesh, M. and Kumar, M.~Flight Formation of UAVs in Presence of Moving Obstacles Using Fast-Dynamic Mixed Integer Linear Programming~Aerospace Science and Technology~50~2016~149-160~~~0~ ~0~ ~14/03/2017 13:07:44.83000000, Radmanesh, M., Kumar, M., and Sarim, M.~On the Effect of Different Splines on Way-Point Navigation of Quad-Copters~ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference~~2016~~~~0~ ~0~ ~14/03/2017 13:07:44.86000000, Radmanesh, M., Kumar, M., Nemati, A., and Sarim, M.~Dynamic Optimal UAV Trajectory Planning in the National Airspace System via Mixed Integer Linear Programming~Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering~~2015~~~10.1177/0954410015609361~0~ ~0~ ~01/06/2016 00:54:40.263000000, Nemati, A., Kumar, R., and Kumar, M.~Stability and Control of Tilting Rotor Quadcopter in Case of a Propeller Failure~ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference~~2016~~~~0~ ~0~ ~14/03/2017 13:07:44.73000000, Nemati, A. and Kumar, M.~Control of Micro Coaxial Helicopter Based on a Reduced Order Observer~Journal of Aerospace Engineering~29~2016~~~http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000563~0~ ~0~ ~14/03/2017 13:07:44.66000000, Brown, B., Wei, W., Ozburn, R., Kumar, M., and Cohen, K.~Surveillance for Intelligent Emergency Response Robotic Aircraft (SIERRA)- VTOL Aircraft for Emergency Response~AIAA Infotech @ Aerospace, AIAA Science and Technology Forum~~2015~~~~0~ ~0~ ~01/06/2016 00:54:40.243000000, Sarim, M., Nemati, A., Kumar, M., and Cohen, K.~Extended Kalman Filter Based Quadrotor State Estimation Based on Asynchronous Multisensor Data~ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference~~2015~DSCC2015-~~~0~ ~0~ ~01/06/2016 00:54:40.273000000, Radmanesh, M., Nemati, A., Sarim, M., and Kumar, M.~Flight Formation of Quad-copters in Presence of Dynamic Obstacles Using Mixed Integer Linear Programming~ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference~~2015~DSCC2015-~~~0~ ~0~ ~14/03/2017 13:07:44.96000000, Sathyan, A., Cohen, K., and Kumar, M.~Image Processing and Localization For Detecting and Tracking Wildland Fires~ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference~~2016~DSCC2015-~~~0~ ~0~ ~01/06/2016 00:54:40.280000000, Radmanesh, M. and Kumar, M.~Flight Formation of UAVs in Presence of Moving Obstacles Using Fast-Dynamic Mixed Integer Linear Programming~Aerospace Science and Technology~50~2016~149~~~0~ ~0~ ~01/06/2016 00:54:40.256000000, Radmanesh, M., Nemati, A., Sarim, M., and Kumar, M.~Flight Formation of Quad-copters in Presence of Dynamic Obstacles Using Mixed Integer Linear Programming~ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference~~2015~DSCC2015-~~~0~ ~0~ ~01/06/2016 00:54:40.270000000, Sathyan, A., Cohen, J., and Kumar, M.~Deep Convolutional Neural Network For Human Detection And Tracking In FLIR Videos~AIAA Infotech @ Aerospace, AIAA Science and Technology Forum~~2016~AIAA-2016~~~0~ ~0~ ~01/06/2016 00:54:40.276000000, Sarim, M., Nemati, A., Kumar, M., and Cohen, K.~Extended Kalman Filter Based Quadrotor State Estimation Based on Asynchronous Multisensor Data~ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference~~2015~DSCC2015-~~~0~ ~0~ ~14/03/2017 13:07:44.103000000, Radmanesh, M., Kumar, M., Nemati, A., and Sarim, M.~Dynamic Optimal UAV Trajectory Planning in the National Airspace System via Mixed Integer Linear Programming~Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering~230~2016~1668-1682~~10.1177/0954410015609361~0~ ~0~ ~14/03/2017 13:07:44.93000000",,"The project focused on developing a prototype of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based incident command decision support system that would enable generation of accurate situational awareness during structural fires/wild-land fires.

Detailed mathematical model was derived and the flight controller was developed; vii) Path planning algorithms were developed to obtain flight plans of multiple UAVs sharing airspace and engaged in respective missions based on both traditional methods such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming as well as meta-heuristic techniques such as Grey Wolf Optimization; and viii) A robust non-linear bio-inspired Genetic Fuzzy based control scheme was developed that allowed a UAV to land on a moving platform using onboard imaging.

Broader Impacts:

The UAV prototype developed as a part of this project will create a paradigm shift in generation of real-time situational awareness for not only firefighting but also many kinds of disaster response situations. Apart from firefighting, which was the focus area of this project, the results obtained from this research are being applied to package delivery, infrastructure assessment, traffic operations, and Unmanned Systems Traffic Management (UTM). The research involved training of seven graduate and eight undergraduate students. The project also organized a seminar entitled ""UAVs for Emergency Responders"" on Aug. 10, 2016 in collaboration with University of Cincinnati?s Fire Science Program that attracted 165 attendees from all over the country. The results have been disseminated to the communities of interest via presentations at conferences, journal paper publications, invention disclosures, and online media outlets.

In the current agriculture biotech industry, genetic analyses of complex communities of plant cells are typically carried out in a homogenized, whole community fashion where the output is global information on the average state of the population of cells.  This can mask the true extent of cellular heterogeneity that is present by averaging properties and potentially missing intriguing outliers.  Molecular analysis at the single cell level would lead to better capability to develop enhanced strains of plant cells that thrive under various conditions.  Thus there is a need for a tool that can provide single cell-molecular analysis in large populations, capable of high throughput while preserving heterogeneity information, and tailored to the agriculture genetics industry. The goal of this project is to develop such a tool by applying microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technologies for molecular and single cell analyses derived from the NSF I/UCRC ""Center for Advanced Design and Manufacturing of Integrated Microfluidics"" (CADMIM) where expertise and discoveries in the design, microfabrication, and manufacturing of microfluidic devices for cellular and molecular processing and detection are utilized. Not only will the proposed technology enable the single cell analysis, it also has the potential to lower the cost per molecular test by an order of magnitude over current methodologies.  Current technology used in the agriculture biotech industry relies on discrete, bulky robotic systems that are time and labor intensive and require larger amounts of power, sample, and reagents resulting in much higher cost per test to analyze large numbers of samples.

The innovation ecosystem that will be enhanced includes CADMIM, UC Irvine, Johns Hopkins University, and DuPont Pioneer.  The UC Irvine site of CADMIM brings microfluidic cellular manipulation, lysing, and micro-scale fluidic handling expertise. Johns Hopkins University brings microfluidic molecular processing and detection expertise. DuPont Pioneer, a leading developer and supplier of plant genetics to farmers worldwide, brings the plant genomic expertise and agriculture biotech business knowledge. Students and post-doctoral fellows from both universities will gain entrepreneurial and technology translation experience through their frequent interactions with DuPont Pioneer's technical team in understanding the current limitations in plant genotyping biotechnology, how a multi-continent international company works to solve large-scale problems, what is required for disruptive technology to displace current working technology paradigms, and how interdisciplinary teams communicate to develop cutting edge solutions.

This project addresses several technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Plant cell genotype screening requires millions of cell-level verification tests and subsequent further massive molecular analyses of specific cell types.  The current plant cell processing and molecular analysis platforms consist of multiple cumbersome and expensive cell processing machines that are time consuming and rely on skilled lab workers operating them in sequence.  This greatly limits the throughput of cells being analyzed and makes it cost prohibitive for applications that require field-based plant seed sampling and testing.  With the integrated microfluidic technologies developed in this project, the multiple steps will be integrated on a compact and potentially portable platform, using smaller liquid volumes to obtain faster results.","Xuan Li  Mohammad Aghaamoo  Shiyue Liu  Do?Hyun Lee  Abraham P.

Device integration, adaptation of commercial microfluidic fabrication process, translation of technology to DuPont Pioneer (UCI, JHU, and DuPont Pioneer).


The UCI team was able to optimize the DEP-based platform for separation of plant cells based on their genotype and cell stages. The goal was to develop a high throughput and efficient platform to meet industrial needs. As for the first objective, we performed the DEP separation of single plant cells in a device consisting of interdigitated electrodes. Our developed DEP device can enrich target plant cells with no effect on their viability which confirms the feasibility of such technique for the isolation process. We performed DEP isolation of different types of plant cells in their stages of development from each other. Viability tests were performed on the isolated cells and no adverse effects of electric field were found on the living cells. After DEP isolation of target single plant cells, we trapped the isolated cells in a single-cell trapping array and characterized their metabolic patterns using Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Spectroscopy (FLIM) and live cell RNA and DNA detection. FLIM utilizes the intrinsic fluorescence biomarkers to characterize metabolic states of cells and tissues. With this approach, we were able to distinguish healthy and unhealthy plant cells.

The JHU team focused on developing a new droplet-based platform capable of performing multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a continuous flow. In this platform, all functional features are integrated within a single microfluidic device. This platform allows for high-throughput target detection within nanoliter droplets, spatially indexed to track several different reaction outcomes in endless samples without pause. We performed successful PCR amplification, within droplets without target oligos. We have also developed a programmable, droplet-based microfluidic device for genotyping maize genomic DNA. Our platform can be used to precisely control the content and volume of generated nanoliter-volume droplets. The device ultimately will be critical for applications in single-cell and single-molecule analyses.

Broader Impact: This project is advancing the state-of-the-art in genetic and single cell analysis of plant cells.  This is a field that is underdeveloped in ""lab-on-chip"" platform, and our research is the first to report on many of the genomic and phenotypic traits of plant cells or samples.  The devices developed (large array single cell analysis, cell sorting, high throughput genotyping analysis) are being patented and available for the field to use and further the understanding of plant cells. At UCI, this project provided the opportunity for training two PhD students on microfabrication and single-cell microfluidic analysis. Specifically, students gained valuable skills in industrial fabrication processes such as high-throughput microfluidic chip fabrication, electrode patterning, etc. The project also provided the opportunity for the students to visit the Corteva Agrisciences? (formerly Dupont Pioneer) site to understand the current state of the technology and to help implement microfluidic devices with the Corteva scientists. Such a valuable experience helped them to be more familiar with the operation processes, regulations, needs, and challenges in industry. At JHU, this project provides training opportunities for two graduate students on design, microfabrication, construction, and operation of microfluidic devices and instrumentation. In addition, since this is a collaborative research project with an industry partner (Corteva Agrisciences), it offers a unique opportunity for our students and postdocs to work closely with industry collaborators, helping our students better understand and tackle the practical needs of the society and better prepare them for their careers. In the summers of 2018 and 2019, the JHU team hosted two REU students who worked on the development of droplet-based DNA detection assays. 

The microfluidic instrumentation developed by this project can be applied to a wide range of applications beyond plant cells and samples, most notably in the human health field.  By sorting and enriching cells based on their phenotype, once can develop rapid detection and diagnosis solutions to human health and environmental applications.  The high throughput genetic analysis platforms can also have broad impact on rapid detection of infectious diseases for the prevention of widespread outbreaks.

The high cost of pharmaceuticals has a direct effect on healthcare costs and is a financial burden on uninsured or underinsured populations in the US. In the developing world, people suffer or die from curable or treatable diseases and illnesses due to a lack of affordable pharmaceuticals. Reducing manufacturing costs through innovations and technology transfer represents an opportunity to significantly bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals. At the present most pharmaceuticals are produced using batch manufacturing technology. In a batch process all of the material is processed at the same time leading to typical equipment that is meters in size that would process hundreds of kilograms of material. Not only is it problematic to process so much material at once, many pharmaceutical manufacturing processes have changed little in decades, and are expensive and difficult to scale. Replacing batch manufacturing of pharmaceuticals with continuous manufacturing is a major technology advance that can change the landscape of pharmaceutical manufacturing in the next decades. In a continuous process, material flows continuously through the system so typical equipment would be tens of centimeters in size and would process a few hundred grams of material at a time. Continuous manufacturing of pharmaceuticals has the potential to be transformative by simplifying development and scale up, and allowing major changes in production. This will result in lower development and production costs for the pharmaceutical industry, and higher quality products and more robust manufacturing processes that will reduce manufacturing costs and benefit society as a whole.
  
An industry/academic innovation ecosystem will be established for the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical process modeling for continuous manufacturing.  The innovation ecosystem that will be created includes Janssen Supply Group, Patheon and Control Associates/QbD Process Technologies. A framework for connecting the process models will be established, and these will be linked to available control models in an integrated system. The potential economic impact is expected to be development of process models and commercial modeling software and creation of new jobs in the next 3-5 years.  Students and post-doctoral fellows will gain entrepreneurial and technology translation experience through training materials, seminars and meetings with entrepreneurs. 

An essential part of the development of continuous pharmaceutical processes and the implementation of continuous manufacturing of pharmaceuticals is modeling of these processes.  In this project, integrated models will be developed to replace the current mode of trial-and-error design of a continuous manufacturing system. The integrated models will allow for model guided experiments and state-of-the-art process design and will be developed as part of the ecosystem and then commercialized. In this ecosystem, a repository of unit operations will be developed that can be used to model continuous manufacturing of pharmaceuticals.  The end product will include a process model library consisting of unit operations, a controller model library that includes different kinds of controllers, and finally the capability of connecting all of these libraries of process templates.","Liang Chen, Zizhou He, Kuriakose T.

Part of the strategy to address this challenge is to improve the reliability and reduce the cost of pharmaceutical manufacturing. At the present, most pharmaceuticals are produced using batch manufacturing technology. In a batch process, each operation is carried out by itself in a unit operation. This means that in a batch process, all of the material is processed at the same time. Replacing batch manufacturing of pharmaceuticals with continuous manufacturing has been generally accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a major technology advance that can change the landscape of pharmaceutical manufacturing in the next decades. In a continuous process, material flows continuously through the system which leads to numerous advantages over batch processes. Continuous manufacturing of pharmaceuticals has the potential to be transformative by simplifying development and scale up, and allowing major changes in production. The use of continuous manufacturing methods enables the integration of the different production steps or unit operations, and this allows for the implementation of sophisticated control systems that enable a reduction in product quality variability. Continuous manufacturing also allows for the utilization of smaller equipment capable of reaching the ?controlled state? in a matter of a few minutes, which can eliminate the need for process scale-up. This can allow for lower development and production costs for the pharmaceutical industry, and also higher quality products and more robust manufacturing processes, that can lead to reductions in manufacturing costs. An essential part of the development of continuous processes and the implementation of continuous manufacturing is modeling of these processes.  In this project, integrated models have been developed to replace the current mode of trial-and-error design of a continuous manufacturing system and rather allow for model guided experiments and state-of-the-art process design. The project has focused on the development of models for continuous manufacturing of pharmaceutical tablets. The models have been developed as part of an academic-based innovation ecosystem with the following end-users in mind: pharmaceutical companies, regulatory agencies, engineering software companies, equipment companies, engineering consulting companies and data management companies. The research has leveraged the research and technology capabilities of the Engineering Research Center for Structured Organic Particulate Systems. The academic-based innovation ecosystem allows for commercialization of the pharmaceutical process models for continuous manufacturing. In this project, postdoctoral associates, doctoral students, masters students and undergraduate students received training in research and technology translation, protection of IP through the disclosure and patenting process and the commercialization of technology. The students and postdoctoral associates also acquired technical skills and knowledge and have been exposed to pharmaceutical manufacturing of solid dosage forms.

The microfilter is important because it makes possible rapid, high purity separation of rare cells from complex mixtures, such as cancer cells circulating in blood.  This high purity separation could enable the early detection of cancers and other diseases.  The project will result in a prototype and scalable process for the manufacture of microfilters with greater than 40% open area. The resulting microfilter will be unique due to the combination of a high open area while maintaining mechanical robustness required for integration with standard medical equipment.  These features enable both a higher purity separation and a higher volume capacity when compared to track-etched filters, the leading filter material in this market space.  

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. First, the method of manufacture will be determined so that a prototype can be made with greater than 40% open area. This will be developed by applying variations of known three-dimensional microfabrication techniques. Second, through testing and iteration, design parameters will be determined to achieve sufficient burst strength. Third, tests will be performed with clinical samples to determine if the filtration capacity and purity meet minimum requirements for an initial application as a cancer diagnostic. In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduates and a postdoctoral researcher, will receive technology translation experience through participating in the customer development process as interviews are conducted. 

This project engages two partners to enable clinical testing and continuation of other business activities. Precision Membranes LLC is a startup co-founded by participating personnel to lead customer development and business model generation activities. Astrimmune LTD will incorporate prototype filters into a clinical trial and provide feedback about performance parameters of various designs.",,,"Development of high open area supported membrane filter for cellular separation of tumor cells from whole blood. With a goal to create high-performance supported polymeric membrane filters, we developed a process to fabricate filters with precise pore sizes while providing a high open area (see figure 1). Fabrication processes were scaled up to produce thousands of filters per month. The application of circulating tumor cell (CTC) capture involves separation of tumor cells from white blood cells and red blood cells. Efficiency of tumor cell capture is important but the purity of the separation can be even more critical. In clinically relevant situations, tumor cells can be present in concentrations one billion times smaller than blood cell concentrations. In filter based CTC capture, blood is flowed through the filter and the smaller red and white blood cells pass through the filter pores while CTCs larger than the pores are retained. Because of the extremely low relative concentration of CTCs, passing a high percentage of red and white (particularly challenging) blood cells through the filter is critical to prevent clogging and to lower background in the genetics based testing being applied to pancreatic CTC identification. A low capture-rate for non-target blood cells is enabled by the high open area filters with precise control of pore size. The white blood cell capture percentage for these filters was less than 0.01%.  As part of this work, 10,000 filters were produced and delivered to an initial customer for pancreatic cancer clinical trials.

This is important because in the future, communication and cyber systems will require optical subsystems with ultra-high transmission rates due to the connectivity requirements of data centers, residential systems, mobile smartphones, and smart network communications.  The optical modulator is a key piece of optical systems and at present is the component that limits the data transmission rates.  This project focuses on developing a working, packaged prototype optical modulator based on barium titanate (BaTiO3) ferroelectric oxide thin films with a bandwidth of 50 GHz, which is 25% higher than the current state of the art technology based on Lithium niobate (LiNbO3).  

Lithium niobate (LiNbO3) has been established as the electro-optic material of choice for optical modulators due to its relatively high electro-optic (EO) coefficient.  However, it has a high dielectric constant at microwave frequencies, which limits the bandwidth of conventional modulators to 40 gigahertz (GHz) or less. Approaches based on silicon, indium phosphide and polymeric materials have been widely investigated to solve this major challenge and although progress has been made, a number of significant challenges in speed and power required remain. This project takes an alternative approach by using BaTiO3 ferroelectric oxide thin films with experimentally demonstrated electro-optic (EO) coefficients more than an order of magnitude higher than that of LiNbO3. In this project, packaged EO modulators with photonic crystal waveguide structure will be developed. Devices will be fabricated using vapor phase epitaxial deposition, and both conventional photolithography and focused ion beam milling. The BaTiO3 thin film platform has numerous competitive advantages over other platforms for optical modulator applications such as (1) Large EO coefficient, ten times higher compared to those of LiNbO3 devices dominating optical modulator markets; (2) Low driving voltage thus low power consumption; (3) Ultrahigh bandwidth higher than 50 GHz demonstrated with potential reaching sub-THz regime; (4) potential for integration with Si electronics leading to ultrahigh compact electro-optical components at low cost. By using a BaTiO3 thin film platform with non-linear photonic crystals, significant improvements in bandwidth, operating voltage, and size are expected compared to conventional devices. A working packaged, prototype 50 GHz bandwidth modulator, 1mm long, will be demonstrated.  The project will involve training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in photonic crystal design as well as offering experiences with technology transfer through the development and demonstration of the prototype.","Peter Girouard, Pice Chen, Young Kyu Jeong, Zhifu Liu, Seng-Tiong Ho, and Bruce W.

CdTe PV is currently competitive for generating electricity in many parts of the world (e.g. 7-9 cents/kWhr from utility scale projects without subsidy) and the costs are decreasing rapidly. However, the objective of this work is to advance the CdTe technology to the point where solar is a competitive source of energy in all regions for individual home owners and a variety of applications which are now considered too expensive to be done electrically.  To achieve this, the work proposed under this award will enable a significant increase in device efficiency while also addressing manufacturing methods to reduce costs.  This could have a direct impact on further developing the U.S. based CdTe industry with the potential for significant economic growth and job creation.  In addition, results from this research will lead to cost-effective opportunities to displace greenhouse-gas emitting technologies with PV technology and corresponding benefits to the environment. 

The innovation ecosystem that will be enhanced includes all the leading groups in CdTe PV technology space. The proposed project will be led by Colorado State University (CSU), which has a long history of successful CdTe PV research and is a founding member of the NGPV. The primary research partner and third-party investor will be First Solar, Inc., the largest U.S. manufacturer of solar panels.  CSU will also be joined by the Center for Renewable Energy Systems at Loughborough university in UK (CREST), the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and material supplier 5N Plus.  Students will gain entrepreneurial and technology translation experience through working with industry on their research projects and formal student training in innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology transfer. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The project will advance CSU's state-of-the-art deposition systems and pursue two separate routes to higher-efficiency manufacturing-friendly cells.  The first route will be to advance the research on unique device structures to move them to commercialization, and the second will be to develop PV devices with a higher bandgap suitable for multi-junction cells.  In addition, detailed characterization of these advanced devices will be performed. The proposed effort will have a clear line of sight to mass production and has the potential to significantly increase the efficiency of both single-junction and multi-junction CdTe-based solar cells.","Munshi, Amit H., Jason Kephart, Ali Abbas, John Raguse, Jean-Nicolas Beaudry, Kurt Barth, James Sites, John Walls, and Walajabad

Electricity generation by CdTe thin-film photovoltaics (PV) offers a strong potential to address this challenge.This Accelerating Innovation Research Alliance project has significantly advanced the state of the art in  CdTe based photovoltaic (PV).  The research alliance including the Next Generation Photovoltaics Center (NSF I/UCRC) at Colorado State University (CSU), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the Center for Renewable Energy Systems in UK (CREST), First Solar and 5N Plus has effectively collaborated to advance device performance and the fundamental understanding of the technology.    The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is below ~4 cents/kWh from CdTe PV without subsidy and the costs are decreasing while the national average LCOE from all sources is 11 cents/kWh.

 

Intellectual Merit. 

Our Alliance works to impact the PV industry with technologies developments that span across the value chain.  Efforts include basic research (density functional theory or DFT) materials science computational simulation, world record device efficiencies to technologies deployed directly on member company manufacturing lines.   Driven by industry input, our focus over the last two years has been to advance device efficiencies.  With partial support from this project, the efficiency of CdTe PV device was increased to 20.1% on low cost sodalime glass and with process that have a line of sight to mass production. These are the highest efficiency demonstrated on these substrates by any academic institution or national laboratory.  This project developed novel semiconductor alloys, novel processing methods, novel defect-passivation approaches, and novel device structures.  At the same time, understanding of the defects, interfaces, and the device physics of the advanced devices was advanced. In parallel, close coupling with industry continued to disseminate the benefits of the research.

 

Broader Impacts. 

The most significant broader impact is the production of clean energy globally on an unprecedented scale.  This will also provide a major benefit for the U.S. economy and will create thousands of well-paying jobs in the U.S.  This program provides a unique collaborative environment between the PV industry and university researchers that enabled significant advances in PV.  Spearheaded by the CSU the Alliance has been the forefront of the CdTe thin film PV technology.  Aided by their long term collaboration, Alliance  member First Solar, (NASDAQ: FSLR) has recently expanded manufacturing capacity from approximately 2 GW/yr to nearly 6 GW/yr  In addition to driving a clean energy adoption, We continue to aggressively peruse entrepreneurial venture development and technology transfer.  Three foundational technologies have been translated out of our IUCRC Center to industry.   All the results from this project have been broadly disseminated in invited talks, publications, etc. The project has partially supported the graduate education of 6 Ph.D students and 2 M.S students and 16 undergraduate students. The PV-training approach at CSU is strongly team based: students from different disciplines work closely with each other, with engineers from industry, and in many cases with students at other universities. 

Driven by our member companies and our Center research results, CdTe solar power is economic compared to all traditional energy technologies. During the last year, CdTe PV with energy storage has beaten fossil fueled generation for supplying power even after dark.

This Variable Delivery - External Gear Machine (VD-EGM) technology offers energy-efficient, reliable and low-cost pumps and motors in engineering applications such as high pressure fluid power circuits (used in construction, agriculture, transportation, aerospace, manufacturing and entrainment) and low pressure fluid systems (fuel injection, washing systems, food and pharmaceutical industry). The VD-EGM concept preserves all typical advantages of EGMs, such as low cost, compactness, high efficiency, tolerance to both contaminants and cavitation, reliability; and it also permits application in efficient ""flow on demand"" systems layout configurations, for which traditional EGMs are not suitable. This will enable: 1) the use of more energy efficient system layouts in current applications of EGMs; 2) the use of EGMs in place of more expensive designs of variable displacement machines (such as axial piston pumps and vane pumps). As a consequence, the VD-EGM has the potential to impact almost all fluid power machines,  which currently handle about 3% of the total national energy consumption, offering significant fuel consumption reduction (up to 40%) without significant cost increase. Similarities in the design and appearance of the VD-EGM with respect to standard EGMs will allow for an easy acceptance of the novel concept into the fluid power market.

This project will result in two functional prototypes (P1, P2): P1 will be a hydraulically operated VD-EGM suitable for power transmission systems involving high operating pressures (up to 250 bar), while P2 will be an electronically operated VD-EGM suitable for low pressure applications (up to 30 bar). To promote commercialization, the project will build a technology demonstrator, a hydraulic fan drive system, based on prototype P1. 

The intellectual merit of this research is the novel principle for obtaining variable timing in EGMs, which uses asymmetric gear profile. This principle introduces an actuation system to modify the fluid dynamic features of the meshing process in such a way that a variable flow is delivered by the EGM. Although suitable to vary the displacement up to a certain range, this principle is applicable for both high- and low-pressure systems and enables high bandwidth associated with flow regulation. The research approach is based on a multi-objective numerical optimization procedure based on a detailed tribological model for EGM that has been created to assist the VD-EGM design. This procedure will advance knowledge not only about variable timing applications of EGMs, but also about the multiple physical characteristics of the meshing process and the displacing action of EGMs.

Personnel involved in this project include, the project PI, two graduate level students and two undergraduate students which will receive innovation and technology translation experiences by overcoming the challenges related to the design of the actuation systems of prototypes P1 and P2 of the VD-EGM. The students will also work with a business entity (Purdue Office of Technology and Commercialization) through the project co-PI, and receive feedback from a gear pump manufacturers that will be instrumental for product commercialization.","Vacca, A., Devendran, R.S.~A Flow Control System for a Novel Concept of Variable Delivery External Gear Pump~Juried conference paper,

The novel concept is based on a variable timing principle realized on the design typical of external gear hydraulic machines, either pumps or motors (Fig. 1). The proposed innovation preserves the typical advantages of external gear machines, which are the low cost, good energy efficiency parameters, high reliability and tolerance to fluid contamination and cavitation. But it also enable the ""flow on demand"" capability, which permits to implement more energy efficient solutions, able to reduce energy consumptions up to 40%, depending on the application. 

This novel concept was first formulated by the PI Dr. Vacca within a previous NSF award through the Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power (www.ccefp.org). The specific objective of this AIT  project was to solve the technical barriers related to the actuation system of the unit that implements the flow regulation, and demonstrate its functionality through two functional prototypes. Specifically, the project successfully implemented and tested follwing prototypes:

Prototype P1 (Fig. 2). A high pressure variable flow pump (suitable for operation up to 300 bar), demonstrating the new proposed technology for high power applications such as fluid power machines (hydraulic presses, mobile construction or agricultural equipment, aerospace).

Prototype P2 (Fig. 3). A low pressure variable flow pump (suitable for operation up to 30 bar), demonstrating the technology for low power applications such as trasnmission systems, charge pumps, fluid transport system. 

The two prototypes demonstrate multiple concepts for applying the proposed variable timing technology. In particular, P1 shows how the flow actuation mechanism can be implemented as manual-operated or hydraulic-operated (pressure compensator); while P2 implements an electric regulation control system. Moreover, P1 proves the applicability of the concept on the pressure compensated design of external gear machines, which is typical for pumps operating at high pressure, Differently, P2 shows how the implementation of the proposed variable timing concept can be significantly simplified for the case of low pressure applications, reducing the implementation costs.

The proposed concept relies on a proper design of the tooth profile of the gears, which can be considered as unconventional for common external gear machines. In particular, the gears have to realize longer regions of trapped volumes, so that the range of flow variation can be maximized. For this purpose, and also to realize prototypes offering good efficiency and optimal fluid dynamic features (low internal pressure peaks, limited regions for localized cavitation), the project utilized the numerical tool HYGESim (HYdraulic GEar machines Simulator) developed over the last year by Dr. Vacca's team. Significant effort was put in advanving the numerical tool, originally developed for conventional pumps, to permit the simulation of the proposed variable timing concept. Particularly, the tool was extended to novel geometries for the gears and to alternative features of the internal flow connections within the units. This modeling work benefitted not only this project, but allowed Dr. Vacca's team to study and publish findings about the effects of gear design parameters on the operation of traditional external gear machines. The two prototypes P1, P2 resulted as best designs from two optimization processes based on a combined Genetic Algorithm - Response Surface Methodology method.

Both prototypes P1, P2 were built with parts fabricated at Purdue University (with the exception of the pump case for prototype P1, which was donated by a gear pump manufacturer). Experimental tests were perfomed at the Maha Fluid Power Research Center of Purdue University, which is the largest academic fluid power lab in the nation. A picture taken during one of the tests on prototype P2 is shown in Fig. 4.

The test confirmed the numerical predictions and permitted to further validate the simulation model. In particular, both prototypes were able to reach a flow variation range of more of 35%, showing how the use of these units could permit similar levels of energy saving in many of the applications above mentioned.

This NSF AITechnology project involved not only the project PIs, but also two master students (working in Dr. Vacca's team as Research Assistant), four undergraduate students (working under Dr. Vacca's supervision). All these students were exposed to training and professional development, through preparation of technical papers and patent applications, presentation at conferences, and demonstrations given to visitors from both industry and academia.

Two patent applications resulted from this award, four technical papers and five presentations (four at international conferences, one at a national conference).

The hybrid metal-glass composite column system is important because our nation is in critical need for durable and safe transportation infrastructure.  Conventional structural materials, such as reinforced concrete and steel, are vulnerable to various hazards and environmental conditions.  Traditional bridge construction methods are expensive, time consuming, and cause major traffic interruptions.  This product enables accelerated construction of new bridges, increased work zone safety, and reduction of travel delays, which optimizes the stewardship of public funds to grow the nation?s infrastructure.  The project will result in the proof-of-concept of a novel hybrid composite column system.  This hybrid composite system integrates the unique energy dissipation of steel material, the excellent strength-to-weight ratio of glass fibers, and the exceptional durability of polymeric resins.  These features provide the following advantages:  superior structural performance, durability, cost-efficiency, and ease of construction when compared to the leading competing systems like conventional concrete-filled FRP tube (CFFT) systems in this market space.  

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) understanding morphology of hybrid steel-glass composites, 2) validating superior structural performance of the column system, 3) developing reliable structural design methodology, and 4) identifying and addressing potential scalability and manufacturing difficulties.  A series of structural experiments will be performed on tubes with diverse composite architecture under various loading conditions.  This will be complemented by high fidelity finite element simulations to optimize the design of the prototype.  After finalizing the design, structural testing of a large-scale bridge column will be performed.  In addition, personnel involved in this project including multiple graduate and undergraduate students, some from underrepresented groups, will receive entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through collaboration with industry partners and communication with Departments of Transportation and bridge construction companies.

Currently, more than 66,000 bridges exceed their 50-year design life and have been categorized as structurally deficient. In recent decades, extreme events have exposed deficiency in bridges that are designed according to code. This revealed the limitations of current structural materials and demonstrated the need for robust structural materials that can be used for new construction. It is necessary to develop novel column systems that are cost-effective, durable, and multi-hazard resilient for implementation in bridge construction.

This project proposed a hybrid glass/steel composite material to be used as a multifunctional reinforcement system in bridge columns and investigated the structural performance. This work addressed deficiencies of conventional composites that limit their application in structures that are exposed to extreme events. First small-scale tests in tension, compression, and bending were run to determine the optimum fiber architecture for the composite tubes for use in structural columns. Parameters including fiber angle, steel-to-glass ratio, and thickness of the shell (layers of glass) were studied. The results were used to inform the design of the large-scale specimens. Two large-scale column specimens were tested under lateral loading to show the energy dissipation and re-centering capabilities of the column system. These factors are critical in demonstrating the resilience of the column to both natural and man-made hazards. The large-scale tests were successful, with the baseline hybrid specimen achieving over 10% drift, over double the targeted drift capacity of typical columns in use today.

Despite the superior structural performance of the proposed column system, its application may be limited due to the need for structural details and lack of understanding on the performance of beam to column connection details. Therefore, to extend the application of the hybrid composite columns to building structures, the feasibility of a connection between the column and a steel beam was investigated. All three of the connection specimens tested were able to achieve high shear capacities, which suggests they are a feasible option to connect steel beams with CFFT columns in gravity frame buildings.

The project contributed to the field of engineering beyond its technical scope by involving all female graduate students. Women are currently highly underrepresented in the field of structural engineering.  The nature of the project provided an opportunity for entrepreneurship which helped the students to become well rounded professionals. This project lead to establishing a start-up company that focused on innovative technologies for bridge infrastructure. It also provided a unique opportunity for a highly underrepresented population of undergraduate students with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD) in engineering through an REU site.  They were made familiar with the importance of translating research to commercialization. These students realized the need for advancement of next generation structural systems and materials for improving the sustainability and resiliency of the nation?s bridge infrastructure. One of the REU students who worked on the project joined the research team in September 2017 and is pursuing her PhD. She has continued working on the modeling of the composite system and was awarded the NSF GRFP in April 2019.

Functionalized delaminated zeolite catalysts are important because they can result in significant savings in energy due to their higher efficiency and longer lifetime, ease of catalyst recovery, and recycling during processing.  These catalysts also aim to replace toxic reagents, which can harm the environment when leaked in the case of an accident, with catalysts that are environmentally benign and pose minimal danger of leakage due to their solid nature.  All of these reasons ultimately result in cost savings for the production of key chemical intermediates that go into everyday products such as plastic containers, coatings, and paints.  The project will result in a proof-of-concept prototype of an organically functionalized delaminated zeolite material, which can function as a robust catalyst for chemical industry.  This functionalized delaminated zeolite has the following unique features:  resistance to leaching, high activity and selectivity in producing a desired product outcome of a chemical reaction, and long lifetime with minimal deactivation.  These features provide cost savings, energy efficiency, and minimal environmental impact, corrosion, and toxicity, when compared to the leading competing industrial catalysts in this market space.   

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The research specifically develops structure-function relationships involving catalysis on surfaces.  An understanding of how heteroatom environment influences catalyst activity and selectivity within the context of delaminated zeolites is provided, which is an emerging area for this new class of robust solid catalysts.  The research also investigates catalytic effects of confinement within the context of 2-dimensional layered zeolitic structures, a developing frontier that is distinct conceptually from conventional 3-dimensional confinement within bulk zeolite structures.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, graduates and post-docs, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences as part of entrepreneurship activities, and as part of a team that is geared to conduct the work of this proposal and further technology in the area towards commercialization. 

The project engages industrial partners who are leaders in the production of chemical products, by aiming to synthesize new materials that will better serve their needs by decreasing the cost and environmental impact of such production.  These partners will augment research capability by providing testing of new materials under industrially relevant environments, which will be used to guide the technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.","N.

All PO manufactured worldwide uses propylene as a feedstock, and 47% of this PO production relies on a reactive organic hydroperoxide as oxidant.  Over 120 customer interviews with PO chemical producers have uncovered that a must have is reducing the current 5% of organic hydroperoxide that is currently wasted during PO production, which, if instead converted into PO, would result in additional revenue for PO producers of $145 M/year, corresponding to a revenue increase of 8.6%. Because of the oxidant?s reactivity, and in order to avoid accidents, the current PO synthesis process requires that 99.7% of the organic hydroperoxide that was originally fed to the PO synthesis reactor be converted within the reactor, before exiting.  This has been a daunting challenge for current PO manufacturers as the process catalysts deactivate and are inhibited greatly, especially at the tail end of the PO synthesis reactor. There, an extremely corrosive and catalyst inhibiting environment consisting of high epoxide and alcohol concentrations abound.  This causes conventional catalysts to operate at greatly reduced selectivity in the tail end of the PO synthesis reactor &ndash; where the vast majority of the 5% of organic hydroperoxide waste occurs in the process.  Further reducing this waste by employing more robust catalysts has been unsuccessful so far.

During the Air-TT grant period, we developed a crystalline catalyst that combines the robustness of highly ordered solid inorganic oxides with the high surface area that is otherwise restricted to silica gel and other amorphous materials.  This was previously thought to be impossible to have a combination of high crystallinity and high external surface area. Our discovery demonstrated that it was indeed possible to accomplish this by the mild delamination of layered two-dimensional zeolite precursors. Based on this discovery, we designed robust, active, and selective catalyst BMS-1 that is specifically geared for the extremely harsh conditions of the tail end of the propylene oxide (PO) reactor &ndash; identified as a must have by PO producers during over 120 customer interviews.  The BMS-1 catalyst will permit the selective conversion of organic hydroperoxide to propylene oxide under these extreme conditions, where the conventional catalyst lags in comparison. The conventional propylene oxide (PO) manufacturing catalyst, which is based on a mechanically flexible and chemically fragile silica network, lacks the structural integrity and mechanical rigidity that is required under the extreme tail-end reactor conditions, to keep the Ti-containing active sites within a stable coordinated configuration. This results in relatively easy Ti-site surface migration, aggregation, and consequent catalyst deactivation and selectivity loss, in the industrial solid catalyst, under tail-end reactor conditions.

Selectively converting organic hydroperoxide under tail-end-reactor conditions is challenging, due to a large excess of catalyst poisons consisting of alcohol and epoxide products.  Our molecularly engineered drop-in replacement catalyst BMS was designed to be used in the tail end of the existing PO synthesis reactor.  In a flow test reactor simulating propylene oxidation with ethylbenzene hydroperoxide, our catalyst BMS-1 is nearly 20% more selective compared to the currently used industrial catalyst which operates at only ~55% selectivity under similar tail-end reactor conditions.  Encouraged by these results, we and our industrial partner began industrial testing of our prototype catalyst BMS-1.  Results of this industrial testing, which was performed in collaboration with a major PO producer, demonstrate our prototype catalyst as being competitive with the conventional industrial catalyst.

This is an electronic ""area sensor"" that can detect improvised explosive vapors at a security checkpoint, in a room, in a piece of luggage, or from a roadside improvised explosive device (IED).  The sensing films are produced by impregnating aqueous reagents (inks) into silica gel of plastic chromatography slides. The sensing films are then placed into a custom dual beam spectrometer that uses a low-cost LED the light source.  A metering air pump provides a constant flow of the ambient air or test gases across the film. During the course of this project inks were prepared with highly specific responses to hydrogen peroxide explosives and their sensitivity and response were optimized. The sensor developed from these improvements performed extremely well for detection of vapors of hydrogen peroxide and the improvised explosive, triacetone triperoxide (TATP). 

The area sensor has widespread applications ranging from explosives detection for homeland security to monitoring peroxide levels for employee protection in industrial and manufacturing operations that employ organic peroxides.  In addition, the hydrogen peroxide detection capabilities of the sensor are useful for monitoring workplaces such as hospitals and food preparation operations where hydrogen peroxide is used for sterilization. The commercialization of this sensor will lead to significant increase in safety for the American public as they are protected from both explosives and harmful vapors.

 

The project contributed to the development of a skilled workforce by providing six graduate students and five undergraduate students with training in nanotechnology and explosives handling and sensing. With the expanding war on terror and the increasing use of nanotechnology by society, the training of these students will be an important contribution to our future human resource needs.

The project participants performed public outreach at the Oklahoma American Chemical Society?s Oklahoma National Chemistry Week ""museum events"" in Oklahoma City, at Chemistry Day at the Oklahoma Museum of Science, at Earth Day celebrations at the Stillwater Public Library and the Oklahoma Museum of Science, and at the annual Oklahoma EPSCoR Women in Science Conferences. We developed a kit of colorimetric test strips and 3% hydrogen peroxide from a pharmacy that allows children and members of the public to perform colorimetric tests. This not only highlighted the National Science Foundation?s contribution to making the public safe but it also fostered interest in chemistry. There was a total of ten such public demonstrations.

Intellectual Merit:

Through the course of the project, we have developed and evaluated a number of approaches, from using a personalized template for high-accuracy tracking, dual-depth camera setup, to data-driven tracking methods. In the end, we have settled on a hybrid tracking method that uses data-driven approach (e.g., deep-learning based) to initialize the pose, followed by a geometry-driven refinement approach. Based on this approach, we have developed a novel system that combines the automatically identified key marker points from color image and the depth information to recover motion trajectory of human subjects, and by leveraging high throughput of GPUs to achieve real-time tracking. With our new system we can provide pose information of a human subject to the users such as physical therapists.

The software tools we have developed allow automatic identification of anthropometric landmarks and interactive adjustment, as well as provide live pose data of a human subject with a single setup. This can be used by clinicians who is interested in human body and pose measurement. These will provide valuable aid and convenience for health science professionals in physical therapy and many other fields.

These panels are constructed with a layer of rigid insulation sandwiched between two concrete wythes. The concrete wythes are tied together using shear ties, commonly fabricated using polymer materials to mitigate thermal bridging through the insulation layer, causing the wall to act as a composite when resisting loads. This project focused on the development of an innovative multi-hazard resistant precast concrete insulated wall system which includes a proprietary shear tie detailed to provide enhanced resistance to extreme man-made and natural hazards. Cladding systems for high risk facilities are often the first line of defense to extreme hazards and shield critical load-bearing components from direct exposure to such threats. These threats often cause exterior cladding panels to accrue larger deformations than typically seen for conventional loading (e.g., wind) and thus may need to satisfy critical deformation limit states in additional to design strengths.
The main design objective was to produce a shear tie which would allow the panels to achieve larger deformations, and thus higher damage levels, without sacrificing design capacity or significant structural integrity. After a comprehensive examination of suitable polymer materials for the tie, polycarbonate was selected due to its combination of tensile strength and superior ductility. Initial tie prototypes were fabricated using state-of-the-art additive manufacturing technologies and, following several rounds of preliminary mechanical testing, the final design revisions were manufactured using injection molding (see Figure 1). Three variants of the ties were fabricated: DT22 (2 in. insulation with 2 legs), DT23 (2 in. insulation with 3 legs), and DT24 (2 in. insulation with 4 legs), using a single aluminum mold block with interchangeable inserts for each tie variant (see Figure 2). The DT23 serves as the standard configuration, suitable for typical insulated panel designs with uniformly spaced ties. The DT22 and DT24 variants serve as slight derivatives of the DT23 design, intended for lighter and heavier panel designs, respectively. The capacity of the ties was evaluated using experimental testing to determine their shear resistance, a parameter used in design calculations for insulated wall panels. Specialized tests were also conducted to isolate the sole shear resistance of insulation to facilitate design of the innovative wall system with different types of insulation.
Following shear testing, a set of 24 insulated wall panels were fabricated (see Figure 3) and tested under uniform pressure using a water bladder setup (see Figure 4) at Lehigh University. Several different design configurations were considered to assess the effect of varying placement location, quantity and number legs for the shear ties. For example, a standard industry design configuration uses ties spaced uniformly at 16 in. on center. Performance-based analyses of the wall panels suggested that a larger number of ties concentrated closer to the ends of the panel provided a more efficient shear transfer mechanism. Therefore, two additional panel layout schemes were designed to reflect this finding. The results of semi-static testing using the water bladder setup showed that although panels with different shear tie layouts are currently designed for the same flexural capacity using industry guidelines, panels with heavier shear ties (i.e., DT24) concentrated near the ends achieved significantly larger flexural capacity relative to standard uniform tie layouts (see Figure 5). All panels achieved significantly greater ductility than panels designed with other commercially available shear tie systems.
The experimental resistance of insulated wall panels was then used as part of a performance-based blast design and analysis framework to estimate the performance of these components to blasts or other extreme loading conditions. This framework was developed using enhanced performance-based limit states to facilitate a more accurate and component-specific prediction of dynamic response, as opposed to current antiterrorism guidelines which specify prescriptive deformation limits and damage definitions for a given component type. Using this analysis framework, several parametric studies were performed to evaluate the effect of varying panel constitutive properties and geometric configurations to determine which design parameters have the greatest influence on the overall response, specifically ductility, of the components.
Following the successful completion of experimental testing and extensive computational modeling, the innovative shear tie system was licensed to ALP Supply, a supplier of precast concrete accessories, to market, fabricate and distribute the ties. Lehigh will continue to work closely with ALP to introduce the ties to the precast and tilt-up concrete construction industries through construction site visits, demonstrations at fabrication facilities and presentation at industry trade shows, conferences and technical committee meetings.
The outcomes of this research are currently being used to develop new recommendations to produce more economical, sustainable and energy efficient building envelopes, especially for facilities susceptible to extreme or multi-hazard threats. This is particularly important, given the growing popularity of these systems in residential, commercial, recreational and government facilities.

Positioning systems have revolutionized how we interact with the world around us.  Outdoor mobile devices make use of technologies like Global Positioning System (GPS) to deliver a wide variety of location-based services. Similarly, indoor positioning systems will enable delivery of new services that provide tremendous social and commercial value to humans in residential and commercial built environments. Indoor location services can be used by enterprises to track and manage assets. Building management systems can use indoor location information to enable services for building managers and occupants and first responders, such as effective emergency response, indoor navigation, and perimeter protection. Furthermore, indoor location services will enable implementation of important services such as coordination of people in a disaster scenario (e.g., natural or man-made (public shootings) disasters and navigation services for the blind). Unfortunately, satellite-based approaches, such as GPS, do not work indoors due to weak satellite signals that do not penetrate through building facades. Unlike existing methods, the proposed smart service will achieve high accuracy and robustness with respect to disruptions, while maintaining low installation and maintenance costs. In addition, users will be able to use their mobile device(s), (e.g., smartphone, tablets, smart watches), without the need to carry/wear additional equipment. 

The project will develop and combine ultrasound, visible light and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)-based positioning techniques with Radio Frequency (RF)-based, magnetic signatures, human ambulation models and building information models (BIMs) for localization, tracking and visualization. The combined use of several independent positioning techniquse not only will dramatically increase the accuracy of positioning over any single technique, but it will add the necessary redundancy to withstand disruption of all but one positioning service, with provably bounded loss of performance. Even in the case of unavailability of all positioning techniques, ambulation models, together with BIM, will be able to provide indoor positioning at a coarser level of granularity. In turn, redundancy can be used to perform maintenance and periodic system calibration on any subsystem without service interruption. The impressive feature of the proposed methodology is that all these properties can be achieved at low installation and maintenance costs, as the system can piggyback on a building's existing audio, lighting, and RF communication capabilities. One unique property of the proposed positioning algorithm will be its modularity and extensibility. Information coming from different sensors will be incorporated seamlessly, allowing the algorithm to work under intermittent failure of one of its subcomponents. The inclusion of ambulation models, together with accelerometer, gyroscope and compass data available on the majority of today's smartphones, will allow the achievement of fine-grain tracking, which will provide smooth trajectories in place of sequence of locations. In the proposed scheme, Multi-sensor localization and BIM play a synergetic role. BIM will contribute to decreasing installation and maintenance costs, by providing precise positioning of the sources of ranging (e.g., light, ultrasound, Wi-Fi antennas) and accurate topological information to develop high fidelity ranging models. Additionally, the semantic information provided by BIM will help with detecting infeasible trajectories. On the other hand, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)-based techniques can help refine BIMs and keep them updated. Dynamic information can enhance BIMs by providing useful information to building managers about traffic patterns and occupancy. Importantly, the design of the smart service needs to be human-centered and to take into account each of the stakeholders, i.e., owner and facilities management team, the service developers, the users of the smart service application program interface (API), who will develop value-added services customized for a particular facility or more generally for many facilities, and, of course, the end-users, the occupants and visitors of the facility, who will use the smart services themselves. To understand the needs and wants of such distinct groups of stakeholders, the project will directly involve them by conducting a series of focus groups. Participatory design is an established technique where a design team works directly with stakeholders to design an artifact or service. Stakeholders will also be engaged in the formal testing of the software service, from installation to maintenance, to application design and to application usage.

Indoor  localization systems typically determine a position using either ranging  measurements, inertial sensors, environmental-specific signatures or  some combination of all of these methods. Given a floor plan, inertial  and signature-based systems can converge on accurate locations by slowly  pruning away inconsistent states as a user walks through the space. In  contrast, range-based systems are capable of instantly acquiring  locations, but they rely on densely deployed beacons and suffer from  inaccurate range measurements given non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals.

In order to get the best of both worlds, we developed an approach  that systematically exploits the geometry information derived from  building floor plans to directly improve location acquisition in  range-based systems. Our system comprised of a novel range-based beacon  infrastructure that uses synchronized ultrasonic chirps between beacons  in the environment and any mobile device with a microphone.  On top of  this hardware platform, we designed a location-based service  architecture that can seamlessly fuse inputs from a variety of sources  like 3D floorplan scans, inertial measurement data and information  crowd-sourced by users moving through the space to streamline both the  setup and management process.  We demonstrated the system in a grocery  store deployment where it was able to precisely localize any number of  smartphones with enough accuracy to show the path towards and the exact  location of products using mobile augmented reality.

Our cell proliferation models are based on probabilistic target inhibition map (PTIM) framework that consists of a series of blocks where each block contains a set of targets connected in parallel. To find the ideal target inhibition profile, we designed a lexicographic search method to effectively search through all possible solutions. This method takes advantage of the properties of the PTIM to significantly reduce the number of potential solutions that we have to search through. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our algorithms using both synthetic models and models generated from Drug Sensitivity of Cancer Database. A theoretical analysis of the expected number of steps required by the Lexicographic Search process has also been derived that was shown to provide a close approximation to actual observed search steps.

In terms of human resource development, the project partially supported a graduate student to conduct research on algorithm design for high efficacy low toxicity personalized cancer therapy drug treatment plans. The project provided the student opportunity to learn the process of conducting research including problem identification, reference researching, critical and creative thinking, idea formulation and validation, computer simulation, technical writing, and oral presentation. Furthermore, the support provided by NSF through the internship supplement helped the student gain valuable experience in Industry (Omics Data Automation) and subsequently land a full-time job offer in the internship company.

Fast switching of light propagation is of prime importance in applications such as optical communications and computing as it allows one to process larger amounts of information within a shorter period of time.  The two discovered effects are the Nanosecond Electrically Modified Order Parameter (NEMOP), in which the electric field is used to alter the refractive indices of the LC rather than to reorient the optic axis as in standard approach used so far, and the polymer-induced modification of the order parameter that allows one to enhance the amplitude of the switched optical birefringence. The NEMOP-based technology has the following unique features: the switching time of optical properties is on the order of nanoseconds and tens of nanoseconds; moreover, the switching-on and switching-off responses are equally fast.  These features provide the advantages when compared to the leading competing LC switches based on reorientation of the optic axis, as the nanosecond switching is million times faster than the current industry standard of a few milliseconds.

The NEMOP-based technology brings a new paradigm in the development of LC devices by utilizing microscopic effects of molecular alignment instead of macroscopic reorientation.  This project addresses the following technology gaps: relatively high operating voltages (hundreds of volts) and moderate (10-3-10-2) modulation of the effective refractive index, as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The researchers will overcome the gaps by a synergy of approaches: (a) polymer modification of the LC materials to increase the amplitude of switching; (b) exploration of LC structure-property relationships in order to enhance the optical response and lower the driving field; (c) design of electro-optic cells that increases the pathway of light propagation.  The main commercial target is communication industry where cheap and light-weight LC optical and infrared modulators with nanosecond response times would be of great value.  In addition, personnel involved in this project includes several graduate students, who will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through the cutting-edge research, targeted development of the technology to the commercialization level, and through participation in the NSF I-Corps program.","Young-Ki Kim, Greta Cukrov, Francesco Vita, Eric Scharrer, Edward T.

This project proved a commercial viability of a significant improvement, by six orders of magnitude, of the switching time of modern nematic liquid crystal (LC) telecommunication devices, from milliseconds to nanoseconds. The major goal of the project was to develop practical approaches to the electro-optical switching of nematic LCs that would have a switching time in the range of nanoseconds and tens of nanoseconds, have a large (350 nm or more) amplitude of field-induced change in optical retardance, be insensitive to reasonable temperature variations. The project has successfully accomplished the tasks through the characterization and selection of the proper LC materials and through the design of electro-optical ""sandwich"" LC cells with multiple total internal reflections of a propagating light beam. The obtained results validated the proof-of-concept, by achieving fast (less than 75 nanoseconds) switching in a broad temperature range (20 degrees that encloses the room temperature), and the change of optical retardance of the LC cell by as much as 800 nm using the driving voltage less than 600 V. 

This research project provided the participating graduate students with opportunities for experimental and theoretical studies of electrooptical phenomena in liquid crystals at record-settings nanosecond time scales under a strong applied electric field. The graduate students also gained a practical experience of the process by which a technology moves from the academic research to evaluation of its commercial viability.

The proposed technique of pulsed magnetic focusing will deliver nanotherapeutics to deep targets in order to direct chemotherapy to where it needs to go in the body. If successful, this technique would enable a technology that could improve treatment for a wide range of diseases. The project will result in a prototype device that will dynamically focus nanorods to deep targets in preclinical studies. In this research, biocompatible nanorods are first aligned in one direction by a fast magnetic pulse, and then before they can turn around a second shaped fast magnetic pulse applies forces on the rods that serve to focus them to a central target. Repeat magnetic pulsing brings all the rods to a central target between the magnets. These features provide the key advantage that therapy can now be focused to a deep target between magnets, for example to treat inoperable deep tissue tumors. Focusing of therapy to deep tissue targets has been a key goal in magnetic drug targeting, and prior efforts in this field have not yet been able to achieve this goal.

However, to date, researchers in the field of magnetic drug targeting have not been able to achieve this goal.

The purpose of our NSF award was to enable magnetic deep targeting.

The reason magnetic focusing to deep targets is difficult is because each magnet tends to attract the nano-particles. If many magnets are arranged around the body, each will locally attract particles to form many foci at the surface of the body. This intuition is encapsulated in a famous theorem by the mathematician Samuel Earnshaw, which basically says that no arrangement of external magnets can create a stable energy trap between them that will focus the particles to a deep target between the magnets.

Our concept was to use the physics of magnetic rods (as opposed to spheres), and fast magnetic pulses to circumvent the assumptions behind Earnshaw's theorem. At short time scales small ferromagnetic rods act as tiny bar magnets. When these small rods are near a large magnet, the rods? pole closest to the magnet will determine the rods? behavior. Rods that are aligned with the magnetic field direction (North to South of the rods matches North to South of the applied magnetic field) will be attracted by a single magnet. Rods that are anti-aligned will be repulsed by a single magnet. Regardless of whether the rods are being attracted or repulsed, the magnet is simultaneously rotating the rods so that they align with the magnetic field. Therefore, given enough time, the rods will always be pulled inwards toward a single magnet.

The key difference between rods and spherical particles, and what makes deep focusing possible, is that typically spheres rotate before they can move, but rod parameters can be readily chosen so that they move before they rotate. Thus it is possible to arrange pulsed magnetic fields so that they push rods away before the rods have a chance to rotate and be attracted to the magnet. This key idea flips the sign in Earnshaw?s curvature constraint and enables a stable deep trap between magnets.

First, using pulsed magnetic fields, we demonstrated focusing between magnets experimentally, in a bench top system.

Second, we created mathematical models of rod dynamics under pulsed magnetic fields. These models were built from physical first principles, and were carefully validated against experiments.

Third, the models allowed us to begin to optimize focusing. Optimization is needed so that we can extend focusing from a bench-top demonstration on a small scale, to a demonstration of focusing in biological tissue. Optimization is also needed to scale-up the system, so that instead of just focusing therapy in a small beaker, we can focus therapy across the tens of centimeter distances that will be required for a human patient (e.g. to a deep tumor). Our optimization efforts showed that the optimal way to focus is to first apply a fairly long uniform field to align all the rods. But then to use magnetic pulses that are as fast as the hardware will allow so as to allow the rods as little time as possible to rotate away from their anti-aligned states. Thus the optimal strategy can basically be summed up as: long align, fast push, fast re-align, fast push, fast re-align, ... .

These insights led to fourth, optimization of our hardware to allow even faster pulses. To create faster pulses we designed and constructed unique high-power electropermanent magnets. Usually, a magnet is either electromagnetic or permanent, and permanent magnets are either hard (don't change their magnetization easily) or soft (do change their magnetization easily). Our magnets combined electrical coils and soft and hard materials. The hard materials provide continuous strength. The coils allow us to change the magnetic fields, by changing the current through the coils. And the soft magnets further amplify what the coils provide. The result are ultra-efficient magnets that can create incredibly strong pulses with reasonable power and energy inputs. Mathematical analysis and optimization was carried out to design and construct these magnets.

Using these advances, we showed that focusing could be extended to longer distances, and could be achieved in biological tissues. We are now (beyond the life of the grant) scaling up the system. Scaleup will require substantial additional effort beyond this NSF AIR-TT grant that supported proof-of-principle.

In prior NSF-funded work, the researchers developed highly capable, low-cost robot hands which, when paired with a standard industrial robot arm and vision system, can grasp a sufficiently wide range of items to be useful for e-commerce order fulfillment and automated restocking applications. The intended applications, however, require extremely low error rates. This project will (1) develop a system to independently test the reliability of the grasping system on a realistic variety of potential customer inventory, and (2) implement and evaluate new mechanisms for the system to detect and correct errors during grasping.

The proposed in-depth evaluation of the reliability of grasping systems in real-world tasks is unprecedented. To date, published assessments of grasp system success is limited to a few dozen to a few hundred trials - and typically results in error rates of 1-10%. The proposed methods for evaluation of grasp errors represents an essential capability for validating the performance of robot hands as they move out of laboratories and factories into diverse real-world settings like homes, hospitals, and shop floors. In addition, this project will develop new methods for independently assessing errors in grasping, as well as new methods for enhancing the reliability of grasping. The proposed system will produce very large data sets that will be exploited in future work for data-driven learning of grasp control and on-line error detection and correction. In addition, post docs involved in this project will receive entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through working to define customer needs and developing application-driven technology.

High-reliability automated grasping systems promise to reduce costs and enhance the productivity of the warehousing and logistics businesses that are a rapidly-growing segment of the economy. By automating the selection of inventory from automated storage and retrieval systems, tasks such as order picking, auditing and packing can be accomplished with fewer sources of error, which is crucial in handling high-value products such as pharmaceuticals and electronics.

Goals included (1) development of a system to independently test grasping reliability on a realistic variety of customer inventory, and (2) implementation and evaluation of new mechanisms for detecting and correcting errors during grasping.

 

The project created a grasping reliability testing system that included an RGB-D camera for object localization and grasp planning, a UR-5 robot arm, and a three-fingered robot hand with tactile sensors, all integrated with an external camera to monitor and record grasping trials, and software that coordinated data acquisition from video and tactile sensors. The project provided the first data sets that included hand motion, robot finger joint, and tactile sensor signals for over 10,000 gasping trials. Additional tests used objects that span a range of shapes expected in commercial applications in warehouse distribution systems.

 

The results indicated that in a significant portion of the hand workspace, the tactile sensor signals are complex and highly variable, making it difficult to differentiate between grasp success and failure. This motivated an analysis of the relationship between tactile sensor spatial resolution and grasp success prediction, using force-based grasp analysis. The results from this analysis define, for the first time, the relationship between tactile sensor performance (resolution, noise, etc.) and grasp stability prediction. This approach enables calculation of the specific contact locations on an object where the tactile sensors are trustworthy and where the object is reliably graspable.

 

This new knowledge has immediate application to commercial implementation for warehouse distribution systems, by automating the process of picking items from bins for customer orders.

The TriPAC magnetic arrangement is important because it allows a new type of high-power pulsed magnetron sputtering (HPPMS) to achieve the same deposition rates as conventional sputtering sources.  The project will result in a higher quality coatings (less stress, higher density, better adhesion) broadly impacting many different industries and research areas- from consumer items (razor blades) to energy production (photovoltaics) to semiconductors (displays) to decorative coatings (bathroom faucets).  The advantage of the innovation is the way the new magnetic field is generated, using only permanent magnets, and the whole assembly can fit into the standard design of magnetrons where conventional magnet assemblies are positioned.  These features will allow easy adoption in the market place and will allow HPPMS to be used in a cost-effective manner compared to the standard magnet packs currently in use. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.   This new magnetic field topology works better than current magnetic fields because it allows plasma to expand further from cathode and provides a less steep potential drop. With this new electric field orientation, ionized sputtered material is more directed towards substrate to be coated and utilized for film deposition in larger quantities than with the conventional magnetic field configuration.  The average incident atom energy is also increased, further improving film densification and making the HPPMS technique more attractive for thin-film coatings. In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, will receive technology translation experiences through seeing this invention turn into a commercial product.

The project engages Starfire Industries Inc., a small business specializing in bridging the ""valley of death"" to take the design which works in the research lab and turn it into a manufacturable product, and the Kurt J. Lesker Company - a large leading firm in this area.

Ruzic.~A Method to Improve High-Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering for Industrial Applications~SVC Bulletin~~2016~~~~0~ ~0~ ~21/02/2017 13:52:48.663000000",,"The modern world is becoming more complex with more machines of better performance, more screens and data transmission devices, more lines of high speed trains and satellites in the orbits. All these advances are available in part from a capability to deposit functional thin films with predefined parameters and qualities and deposit these functional thin films faster and with better reliability every year. Thin films are used various in industries: to make chips and integrated circuits, to reduce friction in bearings in cars, to make better cutting tools.

The present major industrial technique for thin film disposition is a direct current magnetron sputtering (dcMS). This technique provides means to deposit a thin film in vacuum via sputtering a magnetron target. The thin film can be practically of any material or a composite of several materials and can be deposited on various substrates. The dcMS is a well-established method which utilises a sputtering magnetron as a main device to transfer a material from a target onto a thin film. The dcMS when used with Direct Current does not provide enough ionization of sputtered material to control film properties at a necessary for most applications level, and as a result additional tools and methods are used to improve and control thin film quality. Mainly the dcMS produces a flux of neutral atoms from sputtered target, which can not be controlled by electric or magnetic field. The sputtered neutrals should be post ionized with additional devices or methods to tweak and tune the film qualities to a desired level. Thus making the process more complex and more expensive. But not so long ago a High Power Pulsed Magnetron Sputtering (HPPMS) method was developed to increase the number of ions in the flux of the sputtered material. This sputtering method is also known as High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS). HPPMS utilises a high voltage pulsed bias on the sputtering target to produce a much bigger portion of ionized sputtered material. But it was suffering from a tremendously low deposition rate, which was making it an unlikely candidate application of industrial scale.

The AIR - TT: High-Rate High-Powered Pulsed Magnetron Sputtering project was a continuation of a work started at NSF I/UCRC centre as a collaborative effort of a few companies among them: Kurt.J.Lesker, Strafire Ind, Dexter Magnetics and later Gencoa to develop and/or enhance a tool to deposit thin films with better control over deposition parameters and films qualities. The goal of the project funded under AIR-TT became to develop a new magnetron magnetic field configuration of an acceptable for industrial needs size with increased deposition rate of HPPMS discharge. The initial design from previous work resulted into a TriPack magnet pack which had a higher deposition rate than any conventional design, but was not very suitable for operation very thick targets.

Center for Plasma Materials Interactions at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under this project was able to finalize efforts for development of an industry size relevant magnetic field configuration with deposition rate higher than any other conventional magnetic field configurations in HPPMS discharge. The magnet pack was called a Serpentine Magnet pack. Because of the shape of the plasma racetrack on top of the sputtering target.

The Serpentine magnet pack, which produces a specially designed magnetic field configuration and can fit into standard industrial magnetron dimensions, was tested and it was confirmed that the new configuration can operate and produce higher deposition rate of thin films while keeping all advantages of HPPMS discharge. The experiment results are presented on figure 1 and 2. Figure 1 represents a comparison between deposition rates for Serpentine Pack and TriPack. And figure 2 contains pictures of TriPack and Serpentine pack in operation. The results are very encouraging, because Serpentine pack in HPPMS discharge (HiPIMS discharge) has a deposition rate equal to TriPack in dcMS mode. This provides major companies on the market with a new tool. The tool will have higher disposition rate and higher ion fraction of sputtered material than any other conventional device on the market.

The MIR range of the electromagnetic spectrum has recently become accessible (due to the development of semiconductor quantum cascade lasers) and this has opened up exciting applications in chemical sensing, environmental monitoring, and medical imaging. However, fully benefiting from these sensing, monitoring and imaging opportunities requires the development of optical fibers that cover the entire MIR spectrum, are affordable, robust, and easy to handle. This project addresses this critical need by leveraging recent NSF-funded fundamental discoveries in multimaterial fiber fabrication, where distinct materials are combined monolithically in a single fiber strand. The fiber's optical properties are dictated by an otherwise brittle MIR glass, while the superior mechanical properties stem from a robust built-in polymer jacket. The project will result in three distinct optical fiber prototypes packaged with standard end-connectors. When compared to the leading competing MIR fibers in this market space, the monolithic multimaterial optical fibers developed here will offer a broader optical spectral transmission window, lower cost, and superior mechanical robustness for ease of handling and manipulation.

This project, as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application, addresses the technology gap in robust optical fibers that have a transparency window covering the entire MIR spectrum and in which the dimension of the core and the index contrast between the core and cladding may be readily controlled. Recent breakthroughs are exploited in one-step multimaterial preform extrusion in which a fiber preform - a macroscopic scaled up model of the fiber - is extruded from a billet combining MIR chalcogenide glasses and a thermoplastic polymer. The preform is provided with a thick, built-in thermoplastic polymer jacket that is thermally compatible with the glass and thus they may be co-drawn into a fiber. Since the glass is sealed within the polymer, the preform is readily drawn continuously in an ambient environment into extended fiber lengths. The project will result in three fiber prototypes: a multimode fiber with a transmission window extending to a wavelength of 12 microns, a single-mode fiber for transmitting up to a wavelength of 6 microns, and high-refractive-index-contrast fiber tapers for nonlinear applications - particularly MIR supercontinuum generation. All three prototypes are endowed with superior mechanical properties and will be packaged with standard optical fiber connectors to be readily used in real-world settings. This project combines the efforts of a research scientist for fabrication and testing along with an MBA student for market analysis. The project co-PIs in turn combine technical and commercialization expertise and will leverage both the unique fiber fabrication facilities at the University of Central Florida along with business incubation and venture accelerator programs.

For longer wavelengths other types of glasses are required to produce fibers for delivery of infrared (IR) laser light to a desired location. Candidate glasses that have been considered in producing IR fibers include fluorides, germinates, tellurites, and chalcogenides. Two shortcomings are usually associated with IR fibers: (1) high optical losses, typically a few dB/m; and (2) low mechanical robustness (e.g., Young?s Modulus of the chalcogenide glass As2Se3 is &lt; 1/4 that of silica. The latter drawback especially plagues chalcogenide glasses (ChGs), reducing their utility despite their broad spectral transmission window in the 1.5-10 &mu;m range. This is particularly an issue when chalcogenide glass (ChG) is drawn into the form of a narrow and long optical fiber.

By employing a multimaterial, hybrid fiber-fabrication process, we fabricated ChG fibers that are both low-loss and robust.  Starting with highly purified glasses a double-crucible technique (as shown in Step 1 of Figure 1) was used to produce glass canes 2-3 mm in diameter with a core having a slightly higher refractive index than the cladding. These canes were then inserted into a thick polyetherimide (PEI) tube and thermally drawn using a standard fiber draw tower in ambient environment as shown in Step 2 of Figure 1.  Final core diameters could be changed but were typically drawn to be ~10 &mu;m in diameter, a size useful for single mode beam propagation.  See Figure 2 for typical fiber tip dimensions.  Optical and mechanical properties of this fiber were then tested.

Optical transmission losses were shown to be less than 1.1 dB/m at wavelengths of 1.5, 2.0 and 4.6 &mu;m.  Background loss analysis showed that our fiber fabrication process did not introduce additional losses with respect to the glass preform. Previously, single-mode ChG fibers had transmitted up to 2.1 W of laser power at 2 &mu;m, handling intensities of ~5 MW/cm2 on the facet without damage.  Our ChG fibers delivered 10.3 W at 2053 nm (a factor of 5 improvement), 1 W at 2520 nm, and 0.5 W at 4102 nm without damage. The intensity on the input facet sustained 12 MW/cm2 without failure at 2053 nm.  Anti-reflection coatings were deposited on the fiber facets to reduce reflection loss at these surfaces.  This enabled us to achieve 90% transmission through 20 cm length fibers.  Bend losses were measures and were found to be negligible for radii &gt; 5 cm and only 0.46 dB for a 2.5 cm bend radius.
The tensile strength of 16-cm-long fibers with 1.2-mm PEI outer diameter was measured. The inner ChG materials began to fragment at 15 MPa (the point at which beam transmission fails) but the maximum strength of the outer PEI jacket layer was ~100 MPa.  The 15 MPa breaking point is more than a factor of 1000 higher than bare ChG fiber showing that the polymer jacket provides considerable improvement in fiber robustness.

In summary, we have demonstrated a new class of robust multimaterial ChG fibers fabricated in a two-step process that bridges the gap between the double-crucible approach and traditional thermal fiber drawing from a preform. Our new fabrication strategy produces fibers that provide &lt; 1 dB/m loss over a large infrared spectral range, controllable &Delta;n (NA), controllable core-to-cladding diameter ratio, robust mechanical properties and durable coatings. This new type of ChG fiber provides reliable, low-cost, efficient and versatile laser power delivery for numerous emerging mid-infrared applications.

The HydroT sensor of water status and temperature, and the Extended Maturity Analysis that it will enable, are important because they will allow for improved control of the properties of concrete during curing. Improper curing of concrete structures can cause stress that may lead to cracking and ultimate failure. Real-time sensing and monitoring of concrete curing will lead to improved functionality, increased lifetime, and a reduction in the global use of this energy-intensive material. 

The project will result in prototypes of the HydroT sensor, initial development of Extended Maturity Methods using these sensors in concrete curing, and an improved understanding of the priority markets for the commercialization of this technology. The HydroT sensor has the following unique features: 1) unprecedented sensitivity for the measurement of water stress in the range that is relevant in concrete. This capability will allow for water status to be incorporated, for the first time, into methods of tracking and controlling concrete properties during construction. 2) Integration of water and temperature sensing using microfabrication techniques. This approach will allow for simple, low-cost scaled-up and production by leveraging the existing capabilities of microfabrication foundries. 3) Small format and simple integration with electronics and communication. These characteristics will make the barrier for adoption by industry low. Taken together, these features mean that the HydroT technology will provide the concrete industry an important new functionality (sensing of water status) in a device that can replace the temperature probes used in conventional Maturity Analysis with similar costs and technical complexity.   

To translate the HydroT Probe and Extended Maturity Analysis toward commercial application, the team will pursue advances in the understanding and technical approaches on both hardware and application fronts. These developments will involve fundamental advances in the ability to manipulate the properties of critical materials such as the porous membrane and deeper understanding of the coupling of moisture and temperature in defining maturation in important classes of concrete. Additionally, the team will pursue a deeper understanding of the market, competitors, and potential partners for manufacturing and distribution. Throughout, the team will aim to reinforce its intellectual property position and to build a core group of entrepreneurs and technical staff to carry the project into a successful start-up company. As part of the project, the personnel involved - undergraduates, graduates, and post-docs - will gain experience in innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation through participation in the patent application process with Cornell's technology transfer office and activities such as Cornell's Pre-Seed Workshop and technology accelerator program, eLabs.","Olivier Vincent, Alexandre Szenicer, and Abraham D.

Knowing the thermodynamic state of water within a given material helps us understand both the biological, chemical, and physical processes that can occur within it. Materials of interest in this project included biological tissues (particularly of plants), synthetic materials such as concrete, and natural materials such as soils. The most important thermodynamic property is the free energy or chemical potential, because it tells us how accessible a given molecule is to participate in a chemical reaction or to move from one place to another. Our tools for measuring chemical potential of water within complex natural and synthetic materials has been limited. This project matured the fabrication and modes of use of a new tool called a microtensiometer that addresses this limitation. The original concept and initial prototype of this sensor had been developed under a previous NSF award to the principle investigator at Cornell University.

Under this award, the team went through two stages of prototyping of the microtensiometer to achieve technical goals related to size, speed of response, and reliability. Using microfabrication tools in the NSF-sponsored cleanroom at Cornell University, the team shank the overall dimensions of the device by a factor of two. To improve the response time of the device required an innovation that was inspired by the vascular system of plants: the team integrated an array of microchannels into the nanoporous membrane that allows the device to maintain tension. As in the xylem tissue of plants, these microchannels are segmented such that the liquid passes between subsequent channels through thin barriers made of nanoporous material. This design lowers the resistance by allowing the liquid to travel long distances in channels with high conductance and it protects the device from entry and spreading of gases with the nanoporous barriers. The inclusion of this biomimetic vascular structure decreased the response time from around one hour to a few minutes.  The team also developed methods to package the microfabricated sensor to protect the sensing elements both chemically and mechanically.

The team used the sensor and related devices to characterize function in two contexts that emerge in important applications. The first relates to the presence of gradients of temperature in the material in which one would like to measure the chemical potential of water. In this context, thermodynamic calculations and some previous experiments suggest that differences in temperature between the sensor and the material could lead to large errors in the measurement of chemical potential. The team developed an experiment to measure this effect directly with the microtensiometer. These experiments led to the most complete characterization of this effect yet known and provide important information for the development of protocols to use the microtensiometer accurate measurements. The second context relates to situations in which the liquid inside the microtensiometer contains solutes. This scenario is important because solutes could infiltrate the device as contaminates in some applications or they could be added on purpose to change the response of the device. These experiments fully characterized the impact of internal solutes and pointed a way toward extending the range of operation of the device.

The target application for the microtensiometer was the measurement of water chemical potential within concrete during curing. Within the period of this award, the team was not able to define a package that allowed for accurate measurements in the chemically and mechanically harsh environment of concretem, but they did make important progress toward this goal. The team did manage to make the device work in another important application: the continuous measurement of drought stress in woody plants. In this context, the microtensiometer provides unprecedented information about the water status of plants that can inform our understanding of plant physiology and provide a basis for more efficient water use in agriculture.

Cornell holds two issued patents on the technology developed in this award. These patents have been licensed to a start-up company founded by the principal investigator and one of the former students on the project. The company, FloraPulse Co. aims to commercialize the sensor and services that it can support in the agricultural sector. As the technology matures further, it may also serve other markets such as in civil and geotechnical engineering or food processing.

Bancroft St.,Toledo,OH,43606-3390,Toledo,US,9	0,"This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on a transformative technology for converting biomass to platform chemicals (furans) that would replace petroleum-derived feedstocks for fuel and chemical production.  These furans serve as building blocks for a variety of other chemicals and intermediates that are necessary in industry. A process that allows them to be economically produced from renewable resources (e.g. biomass) instead of petroleum-based technologies would result in reduced dependence on fossil fuels, reduced emission of greenhouse gases, and minimal environmental impact. 

The project will result in a proof-of-concept development, demonstration, and evaluation of an integrated hybrid enzyme-and chemo-catalytic technology for high-yield production of furans from biomass sugars. When compared to competing processes that rely on inefficient water-based reaction media, the technology has several distinct advantages. It provides a cohesive pathway to efficiently transfer biomass sugars into a non-aqueous reaction medium; produces the furan product in high yield; and isolates the furan for downstream processing, all with low energy input and recycling of process streams. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: (1) the design, construction, and testing of a scalable process configuration that allows transition from bench to larger scale; (2) the collection of metrics for the prolonged operation of the integrated process; (3) the assessment of the process economics and environmental impacts; and (4) the evaluation of the integrated process with diverse biomass feedstocks and their upstream pretreatment/saccharification methods. In addition, personnel involved in this project, namely undergraduate and graduate students, will receive entrepreneurship and innovation experiences through new interdisciplinary initiatives developed at The University of Toledo based on the Lean LaunchPad approach.","S.

The innovative bone graft material is important in treating patients involved in vehicle accidents, cancer patients following tumor resection, soldiers involved in blast injuries, or children with congenital craniofacial injuries that require large amounts of bone graft to maintain continuity. The project will result in a prototype bone graft as an alternative to allograft or demineralized bone for reconstruction of segmental femur or tibia defects. The unique feature of this bone substitute technology is that the material mimics the natural structure and composition of dense cortical bone. This unique feature provides a safe, mechanically-stable, and resorbable graft that stimulates bone formation without eliciting an immune response and is ultimately displaced by the patient's own tissue. This results in a more sustainable healing solution when compared to the leading allograft products in the market.  

This project addresses the gap in technology for an autologous bone graft in treating patients with large, traumatic segmental bone defects. A biomimetic approach is used to produce a scaffold structure similar to that of natural dense cortical bone in order to overcome the technological gap in insufficient strength as well as tunable resorption of the graft concurrent with bone formation. In this approach, osteoconductive microsheets are generated by nucleating calcium phosphate crystals on nanofibers functionalized with calcium-chelating peptides. Next, rigid, load-bearing scaffolds are generated by the wrapping and fusion of the microsheets into a cortical-bone-like cylindrical structure. Then, an array of microchannels are formed on the surface of the cylindrical structure by laser micro-drilling to form an interconnected network of Haversian- and Volkmann-like canals for tunable resorption and uniform nutrient transport in the scaffold. The biomimetic scaffold is loaded with bone morphogenetic protein-2 to produce a graft for recruitment of osteoprogenitor cells and regulation of stem cell fate toward bone formation. The outcome of this project is a non-immunogenic, mechanically-stable, conductive, and inductive bone graft ultimately displaced by the patient?s own tissue for a more sustainable healing solution. In addition, biomedical engineering undergraduates, doctoral students, and post-doctoral researchers involved in this project will receive training in entrepreneurship and technology translation through interviewing the people in different parts of the product ecosystem in collaboration with mentors at the Faber Entrepreneurship Center and the Office of Technology Commercialization at the University.","D.

To reach this objective, aligned nanofiber microsheets functionalized with a calcium phosphate nucleating peptide were synthesized by electrospinning. The microsheets were incubated in a modified simulated body fluid supplemented with citric acid to nucleate calcium phosphate nanocrystals on the microsheets. Next the microsheets were wrapped around microneedles to form laminated osteon-mimetic microtubes. Then a set of microtubes were packed around a cylindrical rod and fused to form a macrotubular scaffold. Next laser ablation was used to drill microholes on the tube?s surface to form an interconnected network of Haversian/Volkmann canals and a cortical-bone-like scaffold. Functionalization of nanofibers with calcium phosphate-nucleating peptide and supplementation of simulated body fluid with citric acid dramatically increased nucleation of calcium phosphate crystals in the nanofibers, approaching the calcium phosphate content and crystalline structure of the natural cortical bone. The aligned calcium phosphate-nucleated nanofibers displayed shape memory which fused the set of microtubes to form a dense calcium phosphate-nucleated macrotubular scaffold. The dense macrotubular scaffold displayed mechanical properties similar to that of wet cortical bone. The interconnected network of Haversian-/Volkmann-like microcanals in the macrotubular scaffold sharply increased diffusivity of biomolecules and growth factors in the scaffold. The nucleation of calcium phosphate nanocrystals on nanofiber microsheets sharply increased osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of human mesenchymal stem cells. The cultivation of human mesenchymal stem cells and epithelial progenitor cells seeded in the growth factor loaded cortical-bone-like macrotubular scaffold in a perfusion bioreactor substantially increased osteogenic differentiation, mineralization, and vascularization. The cortical-bone-like scaffolds showed mechanical stability in vitro and in vivo for at least 12 weeks. The resorbable, mechanically-stable, osteoconductive, and osteoinductive cortical-bone-mimetic macrotubular graft is a safe and infection-free alternative to allograft bone that is ultimately displaced by the patient?s own tissue for a more sustainable healing solution.

This project will use electron injection detectors developed at Northwestern to develop a 3D imaging technique that can be accomplished without moving parts, using laser illuminated detection and ranging (LIDAR) large detector arrays (""flash LIDAR"").  Most current LIDAR systems use a small number of avalanche detectors and mechanical scanning methods to produce an image. Electron injection detectors, as proposed here, offer a promising alternative to avalanche detectors because they require less voltage and use less power, and can be made into large two-dimensional arrays.  If successful, the proposed work could lead to ""staring"" LIDAR systems, which do not need mechanical scanning and produce a high-resolution 3D image in one shot.  The system would be smaller, lighter and lower cost than existing 3D imaging systems with mechanical scanning.  These improvements could enable 3D imagers to become as ubiquitous as digital cameras are today.  
 
This project addresses the following technology gap as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: increasing the speed of electron injection detectors to enhance the ranging resolution. While the current devices are fast, they do not demonstrate gigahertz (GHz) speed. One of the limitations in achieving this speed is the parasitic capacitances, which will be addressed as part of the research effort. Also, high-bandwidth trans-impedance amplifiers will be used, an improvement over current existing voltage amplifiers. In addition to the PI, co-PI, and the personnel from sub-contracting company, there will be one graduate student who will receive significant technical training. The student will also learn directly from the commercialization work planned for the project, and from entrepreneurship courses offered by the McCormick School of Engineering. 

The project engages Michigan Aerospace, which has significant expertise in LIDAR system, to help identify the best tradeoff between different design parameter in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.","Yashar Movassaghi,   Vala Fathipour, Morteza Fathipour, and Hooman Mohseni~Analytical and numerical evaluation of electron-injection detector optimized for SWIR photon detection~Journal of Applied Physics~121~2017~084501~~http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4976012~0~ ~0~ ~02/04/2017 14:24:10.506000000, Vala Fathipour ; Hooman Mohseni~Detector with internal gain for short-wave infrared ranging applications~Optical Engineering~56~2017~091608~~10.1117/1.OE.56.9.091608~0~ ~0~ ~02/04/2017 14:24:10.446000000, Vala Fathipour and Hooman Mohseni~Detector with internal gain for shortwave infrared ranging applications~Optical Engineering~56~2017~091608~~10.1117/1.OE.56.9.091608~0~ ~0~ ~05/12/2017 14:41:14.73000000, Yashar Movassaghi, Vala Fathipour, Morteza Fathipour, and Hooman Mohseni~Analytical and numerical evaluation of electron-injection detector optimized for SWIR photon detection~Journal of Applied Physics~121~2017~~~10.1063/1.4976012~0~ ~0~ ~05/12/2017 14:41:14.80000000, Skyler Wheaton*, Alireza Bonakdar*, Iman Hassani Nia, Chee Leong Tan, Vala Fathipour, Hooman Mohseni~Open architecture time of flight 3D SWIR camera operating at 150 MHz modulation frequency~Optics Express~25~2017~~~10.1364/OE.25.019291~0~ ~0~ ~05/12/2017 14:41:14.83000000",,"Development of new Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems has gained significant importance over the past decades. In particular, rapidly growing markets such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotics, demand compact and low-cost high-resolution LiDAR systems that are eye-safe and can produce high fidelity 3D depth imaging. Current photon detectors used in LiDAR systems are either avalanche photodiodes (APD) or p-i-n detectors. While APD provides a much better LiDAR imaging, it suffers from a large dark noise at room temperature. We evaluated the performance of a new type of detector called electron injection (EI) for LiDAR application. The EI detectors prior to this project showed excellent gain, but lacked the speed needed for measuring the time of flight of the laser light pulse and could not be immediately used in LiDAR. We explore methods to enhance the speed of the EI detector, by both isolating the absorbing zone of the detector and scaling the key component of the detector called ""electron injector"" to smaller sizes. Using these methods, we could successfully achieved high-speed EI detectors. We compared the performance of the improved EI detectors achieved significant improvements in the 3D depth resolution under identical condition. Our results also suggest that a lower laser power could be used to achieve similar depth resolution compared with the existing technology.

The diagnostic device is important for patients who receive blood thinner medication because of cardiovascular disease.  These patients require constant blood coagulation analysis in order to monitor the efficacy of the anticoagulation medication.  If the anticoagulant drug level is too low, the risk of blood clot formation is high. Conversely, if the drug level is too high severe bleeding (hemorrhage) can occur.  Conventional hospital- or lab-based coagulation measurement is expensive and time consuming. The project will result in the development of engineering prototypes of simple paper-based diagnostic screening devices with several unique features: rapid indication of blood coagulation status; ease of use, with no other apparatus needed, thus allowing patient-operated home use; ultra-low-cost allowing one time use and preventing contamination; fast response time. These features provide significant cost savings compared to the leading competing blood coagulation portable measurement systems, thus greatly expanding the availability of point-of-care testing to currently underserved segment of the population. 

This project addresses technology gaps in using blood samples with paper-based lateral flow assays (LFA) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. This includes specific design of test kits (LFA materials and cassettes) for use of small blood sample volume, enhanced sensitivity to coagulation conditions, low-cost manufacturability. A major consideration is the development of industrial-quality manufacturing processes, with particular consideration to reproducible fluid flow in the LFA nitrocellulose (NC) membranes. The geometrical definition of the NC membrane by mechanical cutting will be compared to a laser milling approach. In addition, personnel involved in this project (research assistant and research associate) will receive entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through the Center for Entrepreneurship & Commercialization at the University of Cincinnati.

The project engages with industrial partners in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.

This is an important consideration for individuals being treated with anticoagulants for cardiovascular disease. By developing this type of device we hope to be able to greatly minimize the frequency and cost of visits to doctors? offices and hospitals for blood testing of these individuals.

The basic device concept uses flow of a droplet of blood obtained from a finger prick through a cellulose sheet (similar to paper). The distance that the blood flows in a given time (a few minutes) is a function of its coagulation condition ? stronger coagulation leads to shorter distances, and vice-versa. We have demonstrated the concept, optimized the device design and operation, and obtained high reproducibility of results. A small-scale human clinical trial with both healthy individuals and patients under anti-coagulation therapy confirmed that this paper-based test for coagulation monitoring is comparable to measurements using conventional desk-top instrumentation. Similar results were obtained with blood from various animal species (bovine, canine, equine, etc.), indicating potential for animal veterinary use.

A study of key product aspects of our device was carried out to assess its potential for commercialization. The study included the competitive landscape, pricing of competitive products, materials cost breakdown of our device platform, performance considerations, such as sensitivity, reproducibility. The results of this study indicated a promising commercial opportunity.

 

The project enabled the training of a graduate student who obtained her PhD degree based on research performed on the project. Following the PhD degree the individual took a post-doctoral position in the PI's laboratory and also participated in an internship at our industrial partner, Meridian Bioscience. As part of the internship, she investigated the process for developing commercial opportunities for the technology and for obtaining government approvals. The results of our research have been disseminated through 15 journal publications and conference presentations, publication of a PhD thesis and by obtaining a related patent.

This project has the potential to lead to economical use of alternative fuels derived from algal biomass. The lack of low-cost technologies for harvesting algae is currently a major bottleneck in the commercial production of fuels from microalgae. When cultivated in open raceway ponds, microalgae concentrations are very low - typically 0.1%. Stimuli-sensitive hydrogels are capable of selectively soaking up large quantities of culture media (without absorbing microalgae cells), thus efficiently increasing concentrations of the microalgal cultures, leading to a more efficient recovery of the microalgal cells. This allows separation of solid cells from liquid media in a cost- and energy-efficient manner and without use of additional chemicals as compared to competing chemical flocculation methods. In addition, the absorbed liquid in the hydrogel can subsequently be released easily through small increases in hydrogel temperature (from ambient to 35?C). The recovered (de-swelled) hydrogels, as well as the growth medium, can then be reused over multiple cycles to create a sustainable algae harvesting process through effective recycling of water and un-utilized water-soluble nutrients.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: (i) continuous hydrogel harvesting in a scalable prototype that minimizes exposure of the gel to mechanical attrition and preserves gel longevity; (ii) use of waste flue gases to de-swell hydrogels through heat integration, (iii) establishes benchmarks for harvesting efficiency, highest culture concentrations achievable, quality of harvested product, and hydrogel stability during prolonged-use.  In addition, undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through design, development and testing of hydrogel-based algae harvesting prototypes.","Vadlamani A, Zhao X, Krusciel de Moraes A, Varanasi S, Viamajala S.~A novel approach for dewatering microalgae cultures using rapid-response stimuli-sensitive hydrogels~Platform presentation at the 2017 Algae Biomass Summit, Salt Lake City UT (October 29 ?

There is a growing demand for stationary energy storage driven by the increasing interest in the large-scale integration of renewable energy into the power grid. However, major barriers preventing widespread stationary energy storage deployment are safety and reliability concerns. By providing more accurate state of charge and remaining useful life estimates, the Smart Battery Gauge technology will improve safety and reliability and enable the widespread use of stationary battery systems within the emerging renewable energy market. This will drive wider deployment of renewable energy systems, which will help meet the renewable portfolio standards targets imposed by many states. 

This project will result in a software prototype of the Smart Battery Gauge technology to demonstrate its real-time adaptive battery SOC and RUL estimations with market-leading accuracy and reliability, and its flexible customization for multiple different battery chemistries. As compared to the existing battery monitoring methods in the market, the estimation data generated by this technology will provide systems management and operations with the advantages of improved energy storage system efficiency, reliability, cost-effectiveness, longer lifespan, and reduced capital and operation/maintenance costs.

This project addresses the following shortcomings of existing battery monitoring solutions: 1) State-of-the-art battery SOC estimation methods lack accuracy because of non-updating parameters, 2) State-of-the-art battery RUL estimation methods either do not exist or lack accuracy because of unreliable energy consumption and battery degradation predictions, and 3) State-of-the-art battery SOC and RUL estimation methods is tailored to specific battery chemistry. This project addresses these limitations through research efforts in the following areas: 1) Extraction of the relevant data and models that are needed for accurate RUL estimation; 2) Design of the adaptive predictive RUL estimation algorithm that can adjust the battery parameters with real-time measurement feedback; 3) The development of flexible battery SOC and RUL estimates using a configurable battery model; and 4) Benchmark the Smart Battery Gauge prototype with existing approaches and competing technologies. This project plans to establish collaborations with domestic and international renewable energy companies, as well as provide outreach to other institutions performing renewables and battery related research. In addition, the graduate students involved in this project will receive technology translation and entrepreneurship experiences through the prototype development and commercialization activities.","S.

Random numbers are indispensable resources for modern information processing and are ubiquitous in computers and communication devices. In particular, they play a crucial role in many applications, including cryptography, privacy assurance, Internet protocols and scientific computing.   Unfortunately current random number generators are vulnerable to hostile adversaries, thus compromising the security of many systems.  This lack of security derives from the fact that no test can determine whether or not a string of bits is random. Thus one is faced with the prospect of having to trust that the random number generator operates as advertised, since this cannot be verified by observing its output alone. If the device is user-built and always remains under the user's control, then this will not be an issue. In practice, however, these constraints are not likely to be met.  A prototype hardware random number generator, operating on quantum principles, will be built using optical components and tested.  The operation of this prototype is unique, since it includes a certification procedure that can guarantee the randomness of its outputs even if the hardware equipment used to generate the randomness is not trusted.  This certification protects the user against hardware imperfections and also deliberate manipulation, and it offers higher security than any other current solution on the market. 

This project aims to narrow or close the gaps between theory and experiment through prototyping such a random number generator. This method of generating certified random numbers is based on measuring entangled quantum states; it was first proposed in 2006 by Roger Colbeck. In 2014, Yaoyun Shi and Carl Miller, two members of the AIR-TT project team, gave the first practical security proof, which fundamentally lowered the requirements associated with implementing a certified random number generator. Recent advances in the optical components needed for quantum information processing have greatly improved the performance of quantum-based measurement instruments. To reach the project's goal, the team will examine the capabilities of currently available components, through numerical studies and theoretical analysis, in order to identify any shortfalls in view of the known security requirements.  The hardware and protocols will be adjusted accordingly, and new theoretical analyses will be developed as needed.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, including postdoctoral, doctoral researchers and undergraduate students, will receive innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation experiences through the prototyping effort and market research activities.","Kai-Min Chung and Yaoyun Shi and Xiaodi Wu~General randomness amplification with non-signaling security~The 20th Conference on Quantum Information Processing (QIP 2017).~~2017~~~~0~ ~0~ ~24/03/2017 11:00:23.660000000, Carl A.

However, quantum cryptographic protocols typically require the users to trust the inner-workings of the underlying quantum devices, and this requirement is a source of vulnerabilities. In the emerging direction of untrusted-device quantum cryptography, such a requirement is replaced by carefully integrated integrity tests by the users. A standard such test is the so-called Bell Test, which was originally proposed in the 1960s as a fundamental test in physics, and was later shown to have a crucial application to quantum cryptography.  The Bell Test can be implemented by transmitting photons (particles of light) between different electronic devices.
In this project, researchers constructed a system for Bell Tests using off-the-shelf components.  These efforts provided useful experience and an actual system for future research and development of low-cost untrusted-device quantum cryptography. The experimental portion of the project contributed to the education of 3 graduate students, 2 postdocs, and 3 undergraduate.  The researchers carried out numerical studies about lowering the requirements on such devices for achieving security.
In theoretical work on the project, the researchers studied fundamental questions related to the Bell Test.  They explored an intermediate scenario in which communication is taking place between a trusted quantum device and an untrusted quantum device (as in, e.g., a server communicating with a remote client).  New results were published about the level of performance that is necessary for such devices to achieve a successful Bell test.  These results added to the conceptual toolbox for understanding the non-local nature of quantum physics.

The Interleaved Sparse Array (ISA) technique is important because it augments the enhanced scanning capabilities of phased-array radar and may lead to cheaper and smaller weather radars with appropriate accuracy in places where traditional weather radars are cost- and space-prohibitive.  This can lead to the preservation of human life, better management of agriculture, and better preparedness for weather-related events.  The project will result in a proof-of-concept demonstration of the ISA technique that will enable dual-polarization phased-array weather radars to achieve necessary polarization purity for weather and hydrological applications in a cost-effective manner. 

In phased-array antennas, each element of the array not only radiates its requested polarization, but also emits an unwanted cross-polarized signal.  The ISA technique is a correction that is applied after manufacturing and switches the polarization of some of the antenna elements in order to cancel the cross-polarized signal of the remainder of the array, or to adjust the overall radiated polarization.  To do so, the antenna elements need to be characterized to determine the number and position of the elements to be switched.  This project addresses how to cost effectively characterize the antenna elements and how to evaluate the resulting performance so that ISA may be applied to commercial products.  In addition to the technical work, personnel involved in this project, including a postdoctoral student, will conduct literature and patent searches related to prior art, work with the university technology office on protecting any intellectual property generated, develop marketing collateral, and work with industrial collaborators and other potential licensees on identifying first adopters of the technology for prototype demonstrations.","Gerard Masalias-Huguet, K.

Phased-arrays are candidate architectures for future weather radar systems that will need to measure the echo from weather targets (i.e. rain, snow, etc.) using different polarizations with high fidelity.   It is generally difficult and expensive to fabricate such antennas with the necessary fidelity. 

The method investigated, termed the Interleaved Sparse Array (ISA) technique, attempts to cancel undesired cross-polarization contamination by using a small fraction of the phased-array antenna elements properly phased.  The concept  is roughly analagous to that of noise-cancelling headphones.  This method, if successfully applied to antennas, could relax the design requirements of such arrays, enabling lower-cost manufacture.

We applied this technique to a 64-element dual-polarized phased-array weather radar antenna developed at UMass.  The array scans in the azimuth (horizontal) dimension only.  We found that the ISA technique resulted in improved cross-polarization performance over the central portion of the antenna beam.  We also found, however, that the overall cross-polarization performance integrated over the entire beam was not significantly improved.  We found that cross-polarization contamination that existed in the elevation plane of the antenna was not significantly cancelled.  The relatively small number of elements in this array also limits the extent to which cancellation can be achieved using just a few elements.  We plan to continue investigation of this technique using a two-dimensional scanning phased array with many more antenna elements and diversity in both azimuth and elevation.

Many low-cost desktop 3D printers are commercially available, but only a handful of low-cost desktop 3D scanners have been introduced in this market. Unfortunately, all these 3D scanners produce low quality 3D models as a result of intrinsic limitations of their technologies. Although the quality of existing low-cost 3D commercial (or home made) scanners is sufficient for hobbyists to replicate small objects using the current generation of personal 3D printers, the resolution of the low-cost desktop 3D scanners is not adequate for applications in art, entertainment, industrial inspection, reverse engineering, medicine, forensics, and in many other more advanced applications. Industrial 3D scanners, capable of producing high resolution 3D models, are available in the market, however they are at a price point one or two orders of magnitude higher, which makes them unsuitable for the high volume consumer 3D printer market, or even for some of the more advanced applications listed above. The 3D scanners to be developed in this project will be competitive in cost with existing low-cost desktop products, but able to produce 3D models of much higher quality, resulting in significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, with resulting competitive advantages.

The project will integrate proprietary technologies within a well designed user-friendly system, which will remove the most tedious steps through smart automation and advanced algorithm design: projector-camera calibration technology will enable the creation of a simple user-friendly semi-automatic calibration process, critical for high quality reconstruction; unsynchronized structured lighting technology will enable the project to leverage low cost hardware components manufactured in high volumes for the mobile market, and also to simplify the circuitry quite significantly; multi-frequency phase shifting technology will enable 3D scanning of objects made of optically challenging materials, such as polished metal and other anisotropic and translucent materials; smooth signed distance and non-convex hull surface reconstruction technologies will result in high fidelity multi-resolution polygon meshes. The project will also develop other unique image and geometry processing technologies to register multiple scans, to cleanup the reconstructed models, and to prepare the models for 3D printing.

Many low cost desktop 3D printers are available as products, but only a handful of low cost desktop 3D scanners have been introduced in this market. Unfortunately, as a result of intrinsic limitations of their technologies, they all produce low quality 3D models.  The 3D scanners developed within this project are competitive in cost with existing products, but able to produce 3D models of much higher quality, resulting in significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, and competitive advantages. Even though the quality of the 3D models produced using home made or existing low cost commercial 3D scanners might be sufficient for hobbyists to replicate small objects with the current generation of personal 3D printers, the resolution is not adequate for applications in art, entertainment, industrial inspection, reverse engineering, medicine, forensics, and in many other more advanced applications. Industrial 3D scanner capable of producing high resolution 3D models, are available in the market at a price point one or two orders of magnitude higher, which makes them unsuitable for high volume consumer 3D printer market, and even for some of the more advanced applications listed above. A second goal of this project was to expose students to the business aspects of commercializing this technology. In partnership with the Brown Program in Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship (PRIME), the project worked with a team of students to analyze the market opportunities in a number of additional application domains, and has been developing a broader marketing and commercialization strategy. The development of the proposed 3D scanner prototypes progressed on schedule. The prototypes comprise mechanical, electrical, and software design components. The prototype design and fabrication required the evaluation of various components, such as low cost embedded computing platforms, high performance lighting sources, and optical engines. The project resulted in a number of publications and patent applications. The technologies developed within this project have been licensed, and a consumer product is currently being developed based in part on these technologies.

Battery units are composed of individual cells connected together to provide the overall energy storage capacity of the battery. The self-X smart battery can automatically configure itself to self-balance from individual cell state variations, self-heal from failures of individual cells, and self-optimize to achieve optimal energy conversion efficiency. These features prolong battery operating time and lifespan while ensuring the overall safety of the system. An improved battery system is important because it will provide a cost-effective, highly efficient, flexible, reliable, scalable, and ubiquitously deployable energy storage solution to address national needs in the fields of renewable energy and transportation electrification. 

The project will result in a prototype of a self-X smart battery the uses a power electronics-based switching circuit to demonstrate self-balancing from cell state variations, self-healing from failures of cells, and self-optimization to achieve the optimal energy conversion efficiency through self-configuration of cell connections.  As compared to the leading battery design and management technology, these features provide the advantages of improved energy conversion efficiency and reliability, longer operating time and lifespan, and reduced operation and maintenance costs.

This project addresses the following limitations in existing solutions as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) the state-of-the-art switching circuit is separated from the battery pack without considering system integration and packaging issues; 2) the state-of-the-art individual power switch in the switching circuit has limited condition monitoring and control functions and needs an appropriate electrical insulation and grounding design for real-world applications; 3) the state-of-the-art online state of charge estimation method is an open-loop method subject to problems of wrong initial state of charge and accumulating estimation errors; and 4) the state-of-the-art solution does not offer an efficient online state of health estimation method.  These limitations will be addressed in this project by designing 1) a power electronics-based switching circuit as an integrated part of the metal connector grid of the battery cells/modules in a battery pack; 2) a low-cost, high-efficiency power switch with integrated condition monitoring and control functions, an optocoupling-based electrical insulation, and a proper grounding design; 3) an closed-loop online state of charge estimation algorithm; and 4) a maximum capacity degradation estimation-based online state of charge estimation algorithm.  In addition, the graduate students involved in this project will receive technology translation experiences through the development of the self-X smart battery prototype.","T. Kim, W. Qiao, and L.

The self-X, smart battery system prototypes incorporated multiple innovations developed by UNL, including modular and reconfigurable battery packs, reconfigurable and scalable battery system designs, condition monitoring, power management, and protection schemes, and a new universal space vector pulse-width modulation method for controlling the switching devices of the three-phase battery system prototypes.  The self-X, smart battery system prototypes overcame the design deficiencies in existing multicell battery systems by automatically reconfiguring themselves to self-balance from cell state variations, self-heal from failures of cells, and self-optimize to achieve optimal energy conversion efficiency and prolonged battery operating time and lifespan while ensuring safety of the system.  The results of this project can significantly enhance the performance of battery storage systems in all aspects, including energy efficiency, safety, reliability, and lifespan and, therefore, offered more competitive energy storage solutions for the applications such as electric vehicles, grid storage, data centers, etc.  Through the collaboration with McNeilus, the results of this project have accelerated technology translation to facilitate commercialization of the self-X, smart battery design.  In addition to batteries, the proposed self-X design is transformative to the design of other cell-based energy storage systems, such as ultracapacitors and fuel cells.

 

The findings of this project have generated five peer-reviewed papers published, two journal papers under peer review, three journal papers to be submitted for peer review, one U.S. patent application, one Ph.D. dissertation completed, and one Ph.D. dissertation to be completed in 2019.  The project team has developed models and software for simulating the self-X, smart battery systems, including the condition monitoring, power management, and protection schemes.  Based on the models and software developed in the project as well as the results of the project, the principal investigator has developed seminar and course materials on self-X, smart batteries and their applications in electric-drive vehicles, renewable power generation, and power grids.  The seminar and course materials have been used to teach undergraduate and graduate students and educate professionals about emerging battery system technologies.  A large amount of data has been generated from computer simulations and hardware tests conducted during this project.  The data provided excellent resources for teaching and further research in the field.  Moreover, the project team has given presentations and seminars on the findings of this project and hosted demonstrations of the self-X, smart battery systems developed in this project for K-12 school students as well as professionals from the academia, industry, and government at a variety of events, including technical meetings, UNL research fairs, invited seminars, laboratory tours, and the NSF AIR-TT Grantee Meeting in June 2016.

COPD affects almost 24 million people in the U.S. and is the 3rd leading cause of death. The CDSS is important because it provides better quality of care for patients while providing significant costs savings related to hospital readmissions. The project will result in a prototype of a smart CDSS, which will enable practitioners to better understand if a COPD patient is expected to be a candidate for hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge. This cloud-based CDSS will have the following unique features: ability to utilize patient information available either in electronic or plain text format, novel algorithms derived from big data analytics, natural language processing and machine learning and ability to provide alerts to healthcare professionals about high readmission risk patients. These features provide the following advantages: improving the efficiency of the care process through system accessibility, effectively utilizing and integrating relevant patient information from various sources, reducing total cost of care through early and preventative intervention, and improving the quality of care and quality of life of the patients.  Further, this CDSS will help reduce the variability in care so that hospitals with historically lower performance can benefit from best practices.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application in the area of clinical decision support systems. The predominant technical gaps are a lack of fusion of structured and unstructured data for the development of predictive models, a limited use of natural language processing, and a significant lack of integration of local and global clinical information. This project provides a comprehensive platform to address these gaps by integration the structured local and global clinical data available in either CCD, CCR or CCDA format with the unstructured clinical data such as physician notes and laboratory reports. Further the system utilizes UIMA based cTAKES natural language processing sub-system that is developed for COPD to analyze this unstructured data.  The predictive capabilities of CDSS are based on multiple leading-edge technologies including data mining, machine learning, natural language processing and data visualization techniques. In addition, graduate students involved in this project will have opportunities to learn the interdisciplinary domain of medical information systems and their real-world applications. In addition, these students will be mentored in technology transfer and commercialization activities. 

Larkin Community Hospital (largest D.O. program in the U.S.) and Humana (the largest health plan in Florida) will provide clinical data and expertise to the project. This project could be effectively deployed at hospitals, healthplans, accountable care organizations and managed care organizations for avoiding hospital readmissions related to COPD thereby, providing significant savings related to hospital readmissions while improving quality of care.","Ankur Agarwal; Christopher Baechle; Ravi Behara; X.

Through this project, a laboratory prototype power converter board was developed via collaboration with our industry partners, based on which ANN control technology has been further extended, enhanced, and tested on hardware experiment platforms for power inverters in solar, wind, microgrid, and other power systems applications. The project has generated multiple high quality journal and conference publications, including more than seven journal papers acknowledged and supported by this project. Other outcomes generated from the project include:

1) The ANN control technology for smart grid won the business plan competition EIT Idea Challenge in Europe, 2014

2) The demonstration of the ANN control technology received a high evaluation from the attendees at 2015 TechConnect World Innovation Conference &amp; Expo in Washington, DC.

3) A business model based on interviews with potential customers, competitors, partners, and investors is generated. 

4) The team participated 2017 NSF I-Corps cohort in Newark, NJ for the ANN control technology in renewable and microgrid applications.

5) This project also brought the application of ANN control beyond the power systems area into electric motor and drives control.

The project has both graduate and undergraduate student participation. Especially, two undergraduate student senior design teams helped to build and developed parts of the prototype hardware system. One team helped to develop a sensor board needed for the development of an embedded ANN microcontroller and the other team helped to develop a microgrid test bed to support the hardware-based testing of ANN control for microgrid applications.

In general, this project resulted in a laboratory prototype and made it closer to a product prototype through further development effort; this project together with the associated NSF I-Corps project has resulted in a better understanding of ANN control market and value proposition, etc. From technical, education and market perspectives, the project has properly fulfilled its objectives.

Due to the ability of THz waves to penetrate through barrier materials (clothes, packaging, etc.), and to perform non-contact and non-ionizing testing, THz systems are positioned to compete with more hazardous and less sensitive technologies like X-rays and will allow resolving images that other technologies cannot resolve. The proposed system based on THz detection would enable the development of new nanostructured THz devices with applications in homeland security, biotechnology, and medicine.

The project will result in a low-cost commercial prototype of the terahertz plasma-wave SOC (system on chip) detector. The device will feature a wide spectral range (0.3-3 THz), an improved time resolution by optimizing device packaging and building integrated signal processing elements, which would allow logic operations with multiple terahertz pulses, such as measuring delays between pulses and extracting pulse position modulation information. This will extend the feasibility of such devices to the emerging fields of THz communication and THz logic systems. Traditional detectors of terahertz radiation include pyroelectric detectors and bolometers, which are very slow (typically within Hz or kHz bandwidth). Such systems are acceptable for measuring the average THz power, but unable to resolve short individual pulses. Existing fast Schottky diode based detectors didn't receive wide acceptance in short pulse terahertz applications due to their static sensitivity and low electrical breakdown thresholds. The proposed device addresses these issues in a silicon integrated platform. While the terahertz spectrum has a great potential for applications in imaging, sensing, spectroscopy, and ultra-broadband wireless communications, realizing this potential requires lowering the equipment cost and size and developing highly efficient, fast, and compact sources and detectors.  The proposed integrated SOC plasma wave detector system will be uniquely suited for the THz market. The development of such prototype will include:  (1) Design and fabrication of integrated amplifier for RF coupling of the detector output with transient digitizer module with an RF bandwidth up to 50 GHz. (2) Design and fabrication of integrated terahertz antenna for the active element and collimating lens for optimization of THz radiation coupling efficiency, and increase of effective terahertz cross section of the detector. (3) Design of integrated data acquisition module.  

The project engages industry, foundries, and university venture development organization to augment research capability, provide test environment, and guide the commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality. Furthermore, the students involved in the project, will take an entrepreneurship course, which, in addition to the courses offered by the Lally School of Business at RPI, will have a directed study course offered by the PIs. The students supported by the project will also receive a 3 hours mini course followed by a pass-fail test on IP, and they will be strongly encouraged to participate in business plan competitions at RPI.","K.

While the immediate application of such devices is in the area of control and calibration of instrumentation such as terahertz systems based on femtosecond lasers, as we continued to work on the project, we have also applied the same principles to gas spectroscopy and ultra-high data rate communications. 

 To accomplish the project goals, our research team has worked on the following tasks, (1) Design and fabrication of terahertz antenna for the active element and collimating lens for optimization of coupling efficiency and increase of effective cross section of the detector, (2) Design and fabrication of integrated amplifiers for RF coupling of the active element with transient digitizer module with an RF bandwidth 10-50 GHz.  

To date, we have designed, fabricated and tested a THz detector in a standard foundry process (Triquint (now Qorvo Inc.) TQP13 and IBM 130nm CMOS technology). The detectors in both technologies have comparable performance to commercial detectors with a fabrication cost that should be much lower than existing products (exact pricing is dependent on the level of volume production). Furthermore, the fabricated THz detectors can be programmed to change the responsivity and operating bandwidth depending on the application. The detectors were tested in continuous wave (CW) mode and under pulsed THz radiations. Based on promising results of the detector tests,  we have been discussing commercial use of our detectors and have already contacted RPI Lally school of business about their incubator program. The PI has also teamed up with other faculty from Physics department, Mechanical engineering, and business school at RPI to create a team that would build on the capabilities of Terahertz system on chip (SOC) solutions and use detection and signal generation principles for applications such as communications and gas spectroscopy. We have also reached out to startup companies (e.g Brightspecs Inc.) as well as major semiconductor companies such as Global Foundries to either use our detectors in their systems or in the case of Global Foundries, use their technology for the fabrication of THz devices and systems.

To date, we have received two provisional patents, submitted one international patent application and published 5 journals, 10 conference proceedings. We have tested our detectors up to 35GHz bandwidth and used the detection principle as part of  a communication link that showed 8Gbps data rate. This data rate is only limited by our testing equipment and we expect to be able to demonstrate above 20Gbps.

The attached figures show two setups that we have recently built (August 2017 to Jan. 2018). The first on gas spectroscopy, where we are using THz systems for detecting Ethanol around 290GHz, and the second on a communication link at 200GHz that can give data rate at least 20X higher than the expected data rate from 5G mm-wave systems.

The CS-FET is important because it enables new miniature, low power, low cost devices for much broader deployments of wireless emergency leak detection & alarm systems to make the oil & gas industry more safe, and eventual integration into mobile consumer devices to allow rapid detection of environmental hazards for the mass market. The technology provides ultra-miniaturization and power reduction sufficient for microbattery-powered wireless gas monitoring. Sensing capabilities will facilitate industrial and consumer safety and health applications. The features will provide compelling commercial advantages in mobility, multiple gas targeting, and suitability for wireless sensor network integration when compared to the leading competing handheld gas sensors available in this market space. Educational benefits will accrue to university of California Graduate student researchers who gain entrepreneurial and technology translation experience through close collaboration with industrial sponsors in more phases of research commercialization than are currently observed in arms-length industry sponsored university research projects. 

This project addresses several technology gaps in translation from research discovery to commercial application. The batch fabricated gas sensor itself utilizes economic semiconductor processes to create a novel low cost, low power transistor that can be chemically functionalized to multiple gas species on a single substrate. The program will additionally support aggressive miniaturization of ultra low-power wireless communications platforms built on new wireless network standards (such as Wireless HART) established for applications such as this. The boundary spanning marriage of university research-driven sensing and communications technology with industry technologists targeting real world problems will validate the innovation ecosystem that is the subject of this program.

The innovation ecosystem that will be created includes oil & gas industry leader Chevron Corporation who provides application & operations knowledge and brings unmet product needs to the ecosystem as eventual customer/end user; Murata Manufacturing Corporation, a multinational leader in electronic & wireless components and subsystems; Rosemount, a business unit of Emerson, a market leader in industrial automation and major supplier to Oil & Gas and other targeted industries; and NanoShift, a microfabrication contracting and consulting company with presence inside the University recharge laboratories where the CS-FET is being developed. The economic impact is expected to be development and manufacturing jobs as well as employment of high technology systems and field service personnel. Some of these impacts will begin to be realized in the 5-year timeframe because of the active collaborative co-development ecosystem that will reduce discovery-to-commercial timeframes. The scale of investment in clean air technologies is illustrated in current Chevron forecasts of up to 1,000 jobs to implement a single facility technology modernization project at their Richmond, California refinery (just one of 143 U.S. commercial oil & gas refineries) some of which is undertaken for emissions reduction.",,,,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

The technology will address the need for low cost blades used in cataract surgery, tissue cutting and hair removal applications. The project will enable high-throughput manufacturing of ultra-sharp semiconductor and ceramic based cutting tools with associated safety features and potential integration of a variety of electrical, optical and mechanical sensors that are not possible in metal based blade platforms. Conventional metal blades used in surgical or hair removal applications experience oxidation and become blunt over time due to micro-chipping, rusting and burr formation. In cataract surgery, a single-use blade is desirable. However, surgeons in most countries re-use them on several patients due to their high cost (around US$50 per blade) emanating from a serial manufacturing process. Such practice may lead to a risk of compromising patient safety. This project will result in massively parallel blade manufacturing processes to produce several thousand identical blades from a single wafer with atomic level sharpness and ultra-long durability at a fraction of the cost of their existing counterparts. Further, the cutting edge profile, sharpness, size and angles of such blades can be fine-tuned and controlled using matured micro/nano-fabrication techniques. Blade technologies developed in this project could dramatically reduce the cost of disposable ophthalmic surgical blades and offer improved shaving experience with integrated sensors for skin and hair condition monitoring. Atomic sharpness achieved via micro-fabrication processes will play a key role in breaking the status quo in the saturated hair removal blades market.

This project will pursue micromachining of silicon and ceramics to fabricate micro-ridges with atomically sharp cutting edges. Unlike the sequential polishing process using harsh chemicals for the fabrication of current blades, this project will develop and employ a massively parallel microfabrication process commonly used by the semiconductor industry. Commercialization of such blades will depend on addressing several technology gaps that this project will address. These include the (a) development of high-throughput fabrication protocol based on a combination of wet and dry etching of thick silicon and ceramic wafers along with conformal thin film coating processes with tightly controlled composition, thickness and hardness, (b) establishment of manufacturing device design space and yield geometrical window, (c) development of an early stage prototype by integrating handles to blades and packaging them cost-effectively, (d) conducting lab tests for mechanical and maneuvering stability, and (e) process development for large-scale production. Semiconductor and ceramics are rust-free, more biocompatible, micro-machinable and their applications in blade fabrication are enabled by highly matured, inexpensive and green micro-nanofabrication technology. A graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) will have the opportunity to be educated in the immersive transdisciplinary nature of this project, uniquely preparing them with training in technology translation to solve important problems in the engineering marketplace and succeed in today?s highly competitive entrepreneurship and industrial environments.

We addressed a number of key challenges and fabricated blades using wafers as thick as 3.0mm. It is worth noting that silicon wafers thicker than 1.00mm cannot be processed by industry yet and our team is still in the process of developing a complete set of fabrication processes for fabricating blades from 3.00mm thick wafers. The prototype blades were tested and analyzed by doctors, potential development partners and investors. Our team visited a number of hospitals, surgical clinics, met number of ophthalmic and neurosurgeons to receive suggestions and guidance. We also had video-conferences with doctors in Africa, Asia and Middle East. A number of new ideas and techniques are currently being pursued to build and test surgical blades in collaboration with the doctors.

Progress in the area of process development: Although the deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) process is well suited for rapid anisotropic etching of semiconductor structures, it is expensive and suffers from many issues including losses of structural resolution when a wafer if very thick. We explored electrochemical etching to cut through thick Si wafers. Our preliminary results using a rudimentary set-up has borne deep-etching of silicon &ndash; an important step toward mass- manufacturable blade processing.

The project was organized in collaboration with Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, US Department of Agriculture, and Water Environment &amp; Reuse Foundation. 

The workshop brought together stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds and geographical regions. Participants from municipalities, federal government, state government, consulting industry, universities, national labs, entrepreneurs, technology providers, private investors, and non-governmental organizations discussed their interests and needs for the test bed network, and they discussed potential network pathways, functions, and structures to meet the needs and objectives. More discussions were then held for developing plans for the formation, operation, and assessment of the test bed network. Based on the findings from this workshop and other activities, a feature journal article was published to lay out a blueprint for the potential testbed network.

Multiple students were trained during their involvement in workshop activities, and they co-authored the journal article. The workshop outcomes were disseminated broadly through journal articles, conference presentations, workshops, and the ideas received positive feedbacks and supports. The workshop outcomes provide visions for accelerating innovation and technology transfer to the market place in the wastewater sector, and some ideas and concepts can be valuable to other industries as well.

Accurate detection of flammable gases is essential for safe operation of many industrial processes, especially in the oil and gas industry. Installing networks of combustible gas monitors in industrial settings can allow for rapid leak detection and increased safety and environmental protection.  The construction and inspection cost associated with installing wired gas monitors in a hazardous facility, such as a refinery, are prohibitive. Battery-powered wireless monitors would eliminate this installation burden, but the high power requirements for current combustible gas sensor technology necessitate a large, expensive, heavy battery or represent a major inconvenience to facility personnel who must replace the battery as often as every week. This project focuses on addressing the need for combustible gas sensors with significantly lower power consumption (at least 100x) than the best commercially available sensor, while maintaining performance parameters such as sensitivity and lifetime.  The proposed ultra-low power combustible gas sensor with competitive sensitivity and lifetime characteristics will enable ubiquitous wireless monitoring of combustible gases in industrial settings, resulting in enhanced safety. Furthermore, in the long-term, the technology may enable embedding gas sensors in smart phones, which will result in increased personal safety. Additional significant impact is on human resource development, in particular in the training of graduate and undergraduate students. 

The core technology in this project is a suspended microheater coated with a sensing material that catalyzes hydrocarbon combustion.  These microheater sensors require only a few mW of power to reach operation temperatures of 500 ?C.  However, several challenges remain in developing a commercial prototype for combustible gas sensing. These include stable adhesion of the sensing layer to the microheater, stability of materials and sensor response in appropriate atmospheric conditions, and reproducible catalyst deposition. This project addresses these technology gaps as it translates from discovery research toward commercial application.

The project will provide core training for graduate and undergraduate students who will benefit from interdisciplinary training in surface chemistry, materials science, electrical engineering and market analysis. The students will gain experience not only in research but also in technical presentation through their participation in meetings with industry leaders. This will provide the students with a unique experience in the interconnectivity between research and development and technology and the marketplace.  In addition, the students will be able to take advantage of resources at the Haas School of Business at Berkeley (such as Launch: The Berkeley Start-Up Competition program) as well as the CleanTech Open Accelerator program to gain entrepreneurial/technology translation training.","A.

Lowering the prohibitive costs associated with installing wired gas monitors in a hazardous facility was identified as a customer priority, and therefore as a business opportunity, by the proposing team. Battery-powered wireless monitors would circumvent this installation burden, if the power requirement of combustible gas sensors could be reduced by a factor of 100 with respect to current technology, while maintaining performance parameters such as sensitivity and lifetime.
This project was able to break through the power consumption barrier by developing a suspended microheater platform, where the micro fabricated heating element is integrated with sensing materials that promote catalytic combustion of the gases to be detected.  The combination of microheater and supported catalyst enabled low power combustible gas sensing. The technical breakthrough was made possible by the use of high specific surface area aerogels loaded with catalyst nanoparticles, which afforded an improved response and recovery time for both hydrogen and propane gas (1-2 s). The fast response of the microheater and the catalyst support means that pulsed heating can now be used to lower the power consumption to the single mW range without loss in sensitivity. A newly realized silicon carbide microheater platform allows for more stable sensing performance at operating temperatures of 500 &deg;C or more.

Both are also co-inventors in a provisional patent filing that resulted from this research.

The new continuous aperture phased (CAP)-MIMO transceiver architecture is important because it represents a promising and practically viable approach for realizing the full potential of emerging millimeter-wave (mmW) technology, operating in the 30-300 GHz band, in addressing the wireless data rate challenge with dramatically enhanced power and spectrum efficiency compared to existing systems operating below 5 GHz. The project will result in a prototype of a millimeter-wave CAP-MIMO transceiver. This CAP-MIMO prototype has the following unique features: a hybrid analog-digital architecture, an analog front-end for spatial multi-beamforming, and a multi-beam selection mechanism. These features provide several advantages when compared to the leading competing designs based on phased-array principles in the emerging millimeter-wave wireless technology market including: multi-Gigabits/second speeds, unprecedented electronic multi-beam steering and data multiplexing capability, and a viable architecture for optimizing the fundamental performance-complexity tradeoffs inherent to millimeter-wave MIMO systems.  
This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Electronic multi-beam steering and data multiplexing capability is critical to realizing the full potential of millimeter-wave (mmW) MIMO systems both in terms of performance (power and spectral efficiency) and functionality (point-to-multipoint network operation in both static and mobile environments). However, existing approaches to mmW MIMO systems ? including conventional designs based on digital beamforming and phased-array-based extensions to multi-beam MIMO ? fail to address fundamental performance-complexity tradeoffs that are critical to technology translation.  The CAP-MIMO prototype developed in this project will provide a definitive demonstration of the critical multi-beam steering and data multiplexing capability and help identify viable pathways for technology translation. The hybrid analog-digital prototype will leverage two key translational elements for filling the technology gaps: a lens-based front-end antenna for analog beamforming, and a digitally-driven multi-beam selection network that enables joint hardware-software optimization of transceiver complexity.

Two technological trends offer new synergistic opportunities for meeting the exploding bandwidth requirements. First, millimeter-wave (mmW) systems operating in the 30-300GHz range provide orders-of-magnitude larger bandwidth than current systems. The second trend involves multi-antenna MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) systems that represent a particularly promising opportunity at mmW frequencies since arrays with a large number of antennas are possible in a compact size. The large number of antennas can be exploited for a number of operational capabilities, including high antenna gain for power efficiency, and communication with multiple narrow beams for enhanced spectrum efficiency. However, conventional state-of-the-art approaches fall significantly short of harnessing these opportunities because of their failure to address fundamental performance-complexity tradeoffs inherent to mmW MIMO systems. In particular, the hardware complexity of the mmW beamforming antenna and the computational complexity of the high-rate digital processing challenge the current paradigms and lead to significant technology gaps that require a new approach.

This project developed a prototype for a new wireless transceiver architecture &ndash; Continuous Aperture Phased MIMO (CAP-MIMO) &ndash; to realize the multi-Gigabit capacity potential of mmW technology as well as the unprecedented operational functionality of dynamic multi-beam steering and data multiplexing. The CAP-MIMO prototype leverages two key translational elements for filling the technology gaps in mmW MIMO technology: i) a lens-based front-end antenna for analog beamforming, ii) a multi-beam selection network that enables joint hardware-software optimization for taming complexity. A complete 28 GHz prototype system consisting of a CAP-MIMO access point (AP) communicating with two single-antenna mobile stations (MSs) was designed and developed in the project. The project culminated in a successful real-time demonstration of electronic multi-beam steering and multiplexing of two simultaneous data streams from the MSs to the AP. 

The students involved in the project gained invaluable inter-disciplinary research experience in communication theory and signal processing techniques, mmW antenna and hardware design, field programmable gate array (FPGA) development, and ""hands-on"" experience through prototype development and testing. The research team also gained valuable experience in developing and evaluating different strategies for commercialization of the CAP-MIMO technology. With the successful development and demonstration achieved in the project, the CAP-MIMO technology is poised for application in a number of use cases of mmW wireless, including fixed Gigabit wireless access, that are being actively pursued as part of fifth generation (5G) wireless technology. The principal investigator and his group are continuing to further develop and refine the CAP-MIMO technology and pursuing various commercialization options. The results from this project could also impact other emerging applications of mmW wireless technology including Gigabit mobile access, sensing and radar.

The microfluidic nucleic acid sorter is important because genome sequencing is fundamental for deciphering biological pathways leading to malfunction and disease. All sequencing technologies require the fractionation of nucleic acids tailored to the specific sequencing approach. This project will result in a proof-of-concept design for a microfluidic nucleic acid sorter. This microfluidic nucleic acid sorter has the following unique features: a dielectrophoretic process fractionating nucleic acids by size and conformation, realization on a microfluidic platform and operation under continuous flow. These features provide the advantages of nucleic acid fractionation in tunable size ranges, cost effectiveness, minute sample amounts and applicability to both DNA and RNA when compared to the leading competing shearing technology and bead purification technology in this market space. 

This project addresses previously little explored technology gaps in next generation sequencing as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application, comprised of the development of a versatile device applicable to a wide range of nucleic acid lengths, conformations and nucleic acid types and, the micro-preparative approach realized through microfluidic integration. Specifically, the project aims in the development of nucleic acid array and constriction fractionators based on insulator-based dielectrophoresis suitable for fragment lengths between 100 bp and ~20 kbp and in volumes and quantities applicable for next generation sequencing. The design of the dielectrophoretic fractionation process will be optimized with the aid of numerical simulation tools and improved device fabrication technologies. A systematic study of size fractionation capabilities of the proof-of-principle devices for DNA and RNA will be performed and optimized fractions will be tested on existing next generation sequencing platforms. The versatility of the approach will allow the application for existing but also future next generation sequencing platforms and their requirements in nucleic acid sample preparation.

In medical diagnostics, for example, the development of personalized medicine requires approaches on an individual basis. These trends are fueled through recent developments in genomics and gene sequencing. The need for novel sequencing approaches also reaches pharmaceutical industries, where biomolecular information is required. Thus, DNA sequencing is revolutionizing research and medicine, however current techniques with enormous economic impact have several important limitations. Before DNA can be sequenced, it needs to be extracted from a sample and isolated into discrete size ranges tailored for the various sequencing approaches.

The field of DNA sequencing is constantly evolving, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches require specific size ranges appropriate for the respective technique. This proposal had the goal to investigate and develop novel and efficient methods of DNA separation and fractionation to deliver DNA of appropriate size for NGS applications. We employed microfluidic devices and subjected DNA to electric fields and various flow conditions to induce separation based on the DNA?s dielectrophoretic properties. We tested two device designs for DNA separation. The first consisted of a constriction sorter which allowed us to deviate DNA of various sizes into different outlets for collection. In the second approach, we tested an array sorter, where continuous streams of DNA samples were subjected to various deflection angles allowing the collection of DNA samples of various sizes. We investigated the underlying electrokinetic phenomena inducing separation and developed novel instrumentation to allow the coupling of the microchip method with existing instrumentation.

This project was conducted in collaboration with post docs, graduate students, undergraduate students and an industry partner. Students and post docs were trained in DNA separation, microfluidics and instrument development. Opportunities were provided for students and post docs to present their results at conferences. Project members were able to interact with the industry partner within the collaboration and at selected conferences. Several events were organized in which the industry partner presented work practices in industry.

This microfluidic dose response analyzer will deliver significant societal benefit by transforming the way preclinical drug discovery is conducted in the pharmaceutical industry. It will guide decision-making early on in the drug discovery process helping to reduce drug development cycle time and cost. The project will result in a prototype with defined design criteria and performance parameters, as well as validation data on cell-based assays. This technology uses significantly less sample and reagent volumes, eliminates pipetting errors and allows automated reagent delivery and washing. These features will lead to significant cost savings, high-resolution data and simpler workflows compared to multiwell plates and pipetting systems that occupy the current market space.

This project addresses the technical obstacles as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Current microfluidic drop methods lack the ability to store cells at precise coordinates on a substrate, followed by addition or removal of media or drugs. As a result, such approaches have difficulty culturing cells and screening for drug efficacy, while retaining the benefits of nanoliter reagent volumes. In this project, this bottleneck will be resolved by coalescing stored and moving drops in a uniquely designed microfluidic network.

Our proposed translational research had two components &ndash; (i) demonstrate cell-based assays using our technology and resolving the accompanying research issues related especially to the viability of cells enclosed in nanoliter droplets and (ii) engineer an alpha prototype and identify design criteria and performance parameters.

To conduct cell-based drug assays we engineered a microfluidic well plate integrated with automated pipettes (FIG.1) that can deliver cell samples into individual nanoliter-scale droplets without the use of complicated fluid delivery systems. The system was optimized in terms of sample volumes and well plate architecture.  We tested the viability of the cancer cells in the nanoliter-scale droplets over a period of one week and found that cells are viable up to 3 days which is a sufficiently long period to conduct drug assays (FIG.2A).  We conducted drug assays using the anti-cancer agent doxorubicin in both standard well plates and our microfluidic well plate and found that the results were in good agreement (FIG.2B).

From a technological and commercialization perspective, our work has shown that the microfluidic well plate system is capable of drug testing on cancer cells with the significant benefits of small sample consumption and readouts at the level of individual cells. This technology is expected to significantly impact pharmaceutical industry where there is a need to conduct assays with precious patient-derived cell samples.

The market for MOCs producing 1 to 8 liters/min of ~90 % oxygen from compressed ambient air is rapidly growing with an estimated global market in 2017 valued at ~$2 billion. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 80 million people worldwide have COPD and nearly 3 million deaths per year can be attributed to COPD. A more compact and light-weight MOC design with substantially higher oxygen recovery and longer battery run-time will provide greater mobility to COPD patients for exercise, improved cardiovascular health and quality of life. 
This project seeks to meet this critical objective through the development of a fully functional self-contained prototype based on a novel patented Medical Oxygen Concentrator (MOC) design. Our MOC design has the following advantages: (1) it uses a single adsorption column inside a storage tank, as opposed to conventional two-bed rapid pressure swing adsorption processes (RPSA), thereby reducing size; (2) it uses fast cycle times in the range of 3-6 seconds to continuously produce up to 3 liters/min of  ~90% oxygen from compressed air which is  3 times higher than the product delivery rate of commercial portable MOC units; (3) it uses less than one third of the adsorbent inventory for a given product flow rate; (4) it uses lesser number of switching valves and sensors and needs simpler process control for the single adsorption bed design due to the absence of synchronized operation of two or multi-column systems. (5) it provides more flexibility in selection and optimization of the individual step times of the RPSA process; (6) it allows continuous product withdrawal as opposed to pulsed product flow offered by many commercial portable units; (7) it is scalable in size and oxygen flow rates; (8) it can be used as a ?Snap On? device without a dedicated compressor in applications where a compressed air source is available, such as in hospitals (military or civil), cruise ships and airlines.
Graduate and postdoctoral students will be trained on new concepts in technology transfer and business strategies beyond basic research. A master's student from the Technical Entrepreneurship program at Lehigh will benefit from incorporating our study in his/her capstone integrated business design project. Undergraduate Chemical Engineering seniors will conduct experiments that will integrate traditional chemical engineering principles across four years into a single comprehensive project as part of their Opportunities for Student Innovation course.  The project will lead to comprehensive prototype performance data for enabling either a new start-up company or for a licensing agreement with a MOC manufacturer for commercialization.","Chin-Wen Wu, Mayuresh V.

The global market for MOCs producing high purity O2 (&gt;90% pure) from compressed ambient air was valued at ~ $2 billion in 2017 and   rapidly growing (~ 6 % /year).  The currently preferred technology for a MOC is a cyclic rapid Pressure Swing Adsorption (RPSA) process using a nitrogen-selective LiX zeolite. The dominant research objectives are to lower the adsorbent inventory in the MOC unit in order to produce a compact, light-weight device and raise the O2 recovery of the process in order to
lower the air compressor power, thereby extending battery run-time.

The intellectual merit of this project was the translation of a previous ""proof-of-concept"" bench-top MOC design to a fully functional self-contained prototype MOC that would move our patented design closer to market commercialization. A fully self-contained ""bread-board"" prototype has been designed, fabricated and tested. The design incorporates our proprietary single bed RPSA system with a concentric storage tank and integrates a bank of small sized compressors, switching valves, logic controllers, and flow manifolds.  The device is capable of producing the target flow rate of 4.8 liters per minute of high purity (92%) oxygen from a compressed air line. The device was also run with the bank of small sized compressors that draw air from the ambient room condition and compress it to deliver to the adsorbent bed. The use of the compressors reduced the product flow rate to about 4 liters per minute at the same purity. The device operation was fully automated with an advanced model-based control algorithm that was implemented in a compact Raspberry Pi hardware platform.

The demonstrated prototype was used as the basis to transfer our  technology to a start-up company -- Pharmateck LLC -- which was founded  as an offshoot of the Life Sciences Greenhouse holdings company, with  our oxygen concentration design as the first technology incorporated in  the company as a license.

The broader impact of our technology, once commercialized and brought to market, would be greater mobility for COPD patients that would be enabled by our smaller, more compact and lightweight design with a longer single charge battery run time. This enhanced mobility would in turn impact their ability to conduct exercise and improve their cardiovascular health. Our project also resulted in a very broad and techno-economic training and education of two PhD students, one postdoctoral scholar, two undergraduate students and one Technical Entrepreneurship Master's student.

The multifocal laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy (M-LTRS) technology is important because it offers new capabilities for analyzing single living cells by directly interrogating their intrinsic biochemistry to assess cellular composition, structure, and function. Such unique capabilities have the potential to overcome limitations of existing cytometry methods, which will lead to new advancements in biological and biomedical discoveries that ultimately will have a significant impact on healthcare. The project will result in a proof-of-concept M-LTRS system that is capable of analyzing a two-dimensional (2-D) array of optically trapped cells in solution. This M-LTRS approach has the following unique features: parallel Raman spectral analysis of up to one hundred cells, non-invasive and label-free chemical analysis of living cells, and long-term monitoring of cell dynamics and response to environmental stimuli. These features provide improved analytical efficiency, unique analytical capabilities, and improved performance when compared to the current state of LTRS instruments in the research community or when compared to the leading competing fluorescence based cytometry methods currently in this market space. 
 
Single cell Raman spectroscopy has a low analytical throughput due to the intrinsically weak signals of a Raman scattering process. The ability to analyze only a few cells at a time is currently a major limitation of Raman spectroscopy for many biological applications, which often require the analysis of a large number of cells in order to determine the heterogeneity of the system. A technology gap currently exists on how to further improve the throughput by detecting the Raman spectra of many individual cells simultaneously. This project addresses this gap as the technology translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The strategy applied in this project is to develop a multifocal LTRS system that is capable of optically trapping a 2-D array of cells and to simultaneously interrogate their spectra. A novel detection scheme will be developed that involves the rapid shuttering of different combinations of the laser foci, allowing for different superimposed Raman spectral patterns to be detected by a single camera detector. A deconvolution algorithm will be developed that, when applied to the superimposed spectra, will enable the parallel retrieval of the individual Raman spectra from each cell with no spectral crosstalk. At the conclusion of this proof-of-concept project, demonstration of a 100-fold improvement in the throughput of single cell Raman spectroscopy with this new detection scheme is expected. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including undergraduate and graduate students, will receive training in entrepreneurship through established programs at UC Davis (e.g. Entrepreneurship Academy) that focus on commercializing science innovations as well as through weekly interactions with the external collaborative partner.

Single cell Raman spectroscopy analyzes the intrinsic molecular bonds that make up biological specimens, providing rich biochemical information that can be used to study biological systems or diagnose disease. A drawback, however, is that the technique is slow and impractical for many biological applications. This project focused on testing the feasibility of a new detection approach that can analyze many cells in parallel. The innovation of the proposed technique is the use of multiple laser beams to interrogate many cells simultaneously and a method of rapidly turning on and off the laser beams in pre-defined patterns in order to detect all of the spectra using a single detector. The main finding in this project is that the multifocal technique can improve the detection speeds by as much as 100 times compared to conventional methods. In addition, we have identified other commercial applications of this technique for improving the imaging speed of Raman microscopes, which is an important analytical tool for many industries. These proof of concept results indicate a strong potential to commercialize this technology. By partnering with a business mentor with expertise in the cytometry market, a market analysis was performed to identify potential applications and to gauge the interest of prospective companies in the technology. This project has led to the formation of a start-up company that will be used to further develop and refine a prototype, which will be used to engage leading companies in the Raman market. The project has also provided an opportunity for several undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers to conduct scientific research and to learn about entrepreneurship. These students have produced several peer-reviewed publications and scientific presentations, and developed a working multifocal Raman microscope instrument.

This technology is important because pharmaceutical tablets and capsules are manufactured primarily by an inefficient process, which involves blending drug crystals called the API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) with inactive filler powders (called excipients).  The resulting mixture of powders is then further processed and fed into capsules or compressed to make tablets. During blending, it is difficult to make sure that the correct amount of the API is distributed throughout the excipient powders. During subsequent processing of the powder mixture it is challenging to keep the mixture mixed and prevent the excipients from segregating or flowing to different regions from the API. This is a particular challenge for low dose pharmaceuticals. If there is segregation or inadequate blending, it can lead to tablets or capsules with too much or too little drug substance. The resulting out-of-spec tablets and capsules must then be discarded. This project will result in a prototype of fluidized bed impregnation technology for manufacturing of pharmaceuticals.  This technology has the following unique features:  the impregnation of porous excipients with a solution containing the API and subsequent drying to produce excipients uniformly impregnated with the API. The excipients impregnated with the API can then be fed into capsules or compressed into tablets without concern for de-mixing or segregation of the API and excipients since the API is now present in the pores of the excipients. These features provide advantages of improved product quality and reductions in out-of-spec product when compared to the usual method of blending API crystals with excipients for making pharmaceuticals. 
 
This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application:  1) For very potent drugs, the amount of API in the solid dosage form can vary from 1% to 0.1% by weight. These very low API loadings pose one of the biggest challenges in pharmaceutical product development: the control of dose uniformity. Low API content variability is highly desired and strictly enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 2) Another challenge in product development is that a large fraction of newly discovered drug compounds have poor solubility which subsequently affects their bioavailability. 3) Another important aspect of pharmaceutical process development is the final product cost. As pharmaceutical companies strive to develop more affordable drugs, any possible elimination of lengthy and expensive unit operations becomes commercially advantageous.  Fluidized bed impregnation of APIs onto porous excipients can potentially address all of the above challenges in drug substance and product development by improving dose uniformity, enhancing bioavailability and reducing the number of manufacturing steps. In addition, personnel involved in this project, graduate and undergraduate students, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through specific training that will address these topics and by being involved with the commercialization of the technology.",,,"In this project we have developed a prototype of fluidized bed (FB) impregnation technology for manufacturing pharmaceuticals. A large proportion of all prescription drugs are manufactured as solid dosage forms, which includes tablets and capsules. For very potent drugs, the amount of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) in the solid dosage form can be as low as 0.1% by weight. This very low API loading poses one of the biggest challenges in pharmaceutical product development: the control of dose uniformity. Low API content variability in the blend are highly desired and strictly enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Another challenge in product development is that newly discovered drug compounds often have poor solubility which subsequently affects their bioavailability. An important aspect of pharmaceutical process development is the final product cost. As pharmaceutical companies strive to develop more affordable drugs, any possible elimination of lengthy and expensive unit operations becomes commercially advantageous. One group of such unit operations is associated with the control of API attributes (size, size distribution, shape, bulk density, etc.). These unit operations can include crystallization control and various milling and de-lumping steps. The need for control of API attributes is solely dictated by the drug product development and usually is associated with desired improvements in blend uniformity or release profile. Having a formulation process that can make these and other steps unnecessary can potentially provide a large advantage to pharmaceutical companies. This project has examined a manufacturing method for solid dosage forms using fluidized bed impregnation of APIs onto porous excipients that can potentially address all of the above challenges in drug substance and product development.  Fluidized bed impregnation can be summarized as the combination of three distinct processes taking place simultaneously. These include fluidization of the porous carrier, spraying API solution within the bed, which penetrates the excipient due to capillary forces, and drying of the porous particles causing the API to be deposited within. We have shown that this process can deliver final product with high blend uniformity, and final API loading is not limited by its solubility in the organic solvent. Fluidized bed impregnation by design does not depend on the nature of the API but rather on the nature of the excipient used. The product is an excipient impregnated with API that has flow properties that depend on the excipient and not on the physical properties of the API. In this project we have demonstrated an integrated technology for fluidized bed impregnation that is designed and optimized based on an in-depth understanding of the main components of the manufacturing system. Using fluidized bed impregnation, we have successfully produced capsules and tablets and shown, using various characterization techniques, that the capsules and tablets would pass quality standards as specified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In this project, a doctoral student received training in research and technology translation, protection of IP through the disclosure and patenting process and the commercialization of technology. The doctoral student has also acquired technical skills and knowledge and has been exposed to pharmaceutical manufacturing of solid dosage forms, and has had the opportunity for presentation of research results.

The controlled delivery of growth factor is important because it keeps the growth factor active longer in the body so as to accelerate wound closure and potentially reduce scar formation as well.  The project will result in a prototype of a wound dressing. This dressing will protect the bioactivity of growth factors and control their release. These features provide the following advantages: accelerated wound healing, reduced dressing changing frequency, reduced cost of care when compared to the leading competing wound dressing based on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Furthermore, the one-time therapy can be easily used by patients or their family care givers, thus reducing cost compared to products that require professional handling such as vacuum therapy. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) Deciphering the polyvalent interactions between the components of the controlled release system. 2) Knowledge on how to regulate the release kinetics using ionic interactions.  3) A delivery system that can protect the bioactivity of a wide range of proteins in various biotechnological and biomedical applications. These gaps will be bridged by 1) Varying the polycation of the controlled release system. 2) Adjusting the composition of the controlled delivery vehicle and the dosage of the growth factor.  3) Using heparin in the delivery system, thus allowing the controlled release of greater than 200 heparin binding proteins including heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, PDGF and fibroblast growth factor.   In addition, graduate students and post-docs involved in this project will receive technology translation experiences through participation in the ""Benchtop to Bedside"" and the ""Academic Entrepreneurship"" courses and University of Pittsburgh Big Idea Competition.",,,"Scientists have realized the therapeutic potential of growth factors decades ago. However, the short window of activity of these therapeutic proteins requires multiple large doses, and their efficacy is highly debated among clinicians. We developed a method of protecting these proteins so their activity are extended more than 10-fold. Furthermore, the vehicle can release the proteins in a controlled manner to improve wound healing.  Here we use a porcine model, whose skin is the closest to that of humans. Our treatment increased the rate of wound closure by 35% compared to controls. Additionally, PRP coacervate doubled the rate of wound contraction compared to all other treatments, including that of naked proteins of the same dosage. Wounds treated with our therapy exhibited increased alignment of the proteins that give skin its toughness and strength. The treatment also improved vascular support of the healing skin when compared to control treatments. These results suggest that our treatment strategy accelerates healing of cutaneous wounds. The delivery vehicle is a simple and effective tool to improve the therapeutic efficacy of therapeutic proteins for wound healing. Our immediate next goal is to translate this technology into a real product to help people heal chronic wounds such as diabetic ulcers. This will have a broad impact on the care of millions of people due to the increased prevalence of diabetes, not only among the elderly, but the youth of our country.

The growing elderly population coupled with low birth rates in the developed world is creating a crisis in healthcare. The number of senior citizens is outgrowing the number of working-age adults to care for them. In the U.S. alone, the number of seniors over age 65 is projected to double from year 2000 to 2030, reaching 71.5 million. With the scarcity of care options available, affordable robots are a welcome solution for assisting elders with small tasks that would normally be done by a caregiver. While helping elders with activities of daily living in an elder care facility, the system learns about them. It can then do things such as help ensure that they are eating or drinking healthily.

The project consists of two main parts: development of a low-cost mobile manipulator capable of a limited set of elder-relevant manipulation tasks (e.g., picking up dropped items or filling a water glass); and development of a data-driven service system that analyzes the use of the robot over time to monitor elder health via service requests and pro-actively offer assistance as needed. One key to making this system viable is maintaining effectiveness at low cost. This work builds on a commercial low-cost mobile robot platform being developed at Savioke and adds manipulation capabilities via a novel low-cost expanding prismatic joint arm under development at the University of Pennsylvania. This mobile manipulator robot will be used to perform service tasks, such as delivering water to elders. The data gathered by these robots and how elders use them in the field will provide information about how robots can help create a larger data-driven health monitoring system.

The project consisted of development of a low-cost mobile manipulator capable of a limited set of elder-relevant manipulation tasks (e.g. picking up dropped items or filling a water glass); and exploration into the viable tasks robots could do that could be useful for obtaining data to aid health care providers. One key to making this system viable is maintaining effectiveness at low cost.

The work on this project was led by an interdisciplinary team and engaged both nursing and engineering students.  The engineers learned and participated in social science methodologies studying elders.  This included what it means to run focus groups with human subjects and completing IRB's.  They also became familiar with data and privacy concerns as well as the context of working with elders in low income communities. Nursing students gained the opportunity to engage in focus groups, analyze themes from the focus groups that guided the interventions the robot would accomplish.  Nursing students also engaged in the robotic technology development and how robotics can be incorporated into elder care.

For the mobile manipulator platform we developed, the team identified three tasks the robot could do that would be valuable to the stakeholders. The stakeholders included clinicians, elders and paid caregivers.  These tasks involved: walking encouragement, water delivery - maintaining hydration, and assistance in fetching objects in the context of playing a throwing game.  The developed robot was tested with elders from one community based long-term care center through three deployments.  In the early deployments, the challenges of interacting with elders became more apparent. This included design recommendations for the robots such as louder audio interfaces suitable for those who were hearing-impaired and visual and button interfaces suitable for wheel-chair bound elders.  In the final deployment different levels of interaction and hardware configuration were tested and results from post-interaction surveys with elders indicated high acceptance of the robot as an assistant in the bean bag toss game, despite being slower than a human for retrieving and handing off the objects.

These next generation materials will enhance the sustainability of infrastructure, buildings, and bridges when subjected to environmental loadings.   The project will result in a large-scale cast-in-place mixing procedure and high energy input mixers, as well as design recommendations and analytical models for the design and analysis of structural members of ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHP-FRC). The UHP-FRC is important because the major problem of concrete is the considerable deterioration and consequent repair work needed due to its brittleness and limited durability. The consequence of concrete deterioration and short service life requires frequent repair and eventual replacement, which consumes more natural resources. Using UHP-FRC will introduce significant enhancement in the sustainability of concrete structures due to its damage-tolerance characteristics. These characteristics can reduce significantly the amount of repair-rehabilitation-maintenance work and give infrastructure longer service life, all of which will eventually lower the environmental liability of concrete use and lead to enhanced sustainability, safety, performance, and economy of our future infrastructure. 
UHP-FRC has the following unique features: high compressive strength, up to 25 to 30 ksi, excellent compressive and tensile ductility beyond first cracking, and high flowability. The new mixing procedure requires no special treatments such as heat, pressure, and vacuum, thereby avoiding any major changes to current concrete production practice. This makes the conversion seamless and cost effective. In addition, the use of UHP-FRC is expected to provide greater durability, high damage tolerance, life-cycle cost savings, simplified construction, and structural efficiency when compared to the leading competing high-performance concrete that is either proprietary or requires a unique mixing procedure.   
  The project engages a small business partner, Bailey Tools Manufacturing (BTM), to develop the large-capacity high-shear mixers and high-performance fibers, as well as the Texas Manufacturing Assistance Center (TMAC), to guide commercialization aspects, in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.
  This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) to develop a large-scale cast-in-place mixing design procedure and high energy input mixers; 2) to formulate design recommendations and analytical models for the design and analysis of UHP-FRC structural members. Experimental results will be used to formulate the major design aspects for UHP-FRC structural members. Once representative relationships are developed, systematic parametric evaluations will be carried out with particular attention paid to the flexural and shear design recommendations of UHP-FRC structural members.
  The potential economic impact is expected to be transformational, creating a more durable product with cost savings that will be clearly evident in the next 10 years. Implementation of the new equipment and technology will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the next-generation construction market and will reduce state funded concrete installation and repair costs by at least 25%.","Chao, S.-H., Kaka, V., Palacios, G., Kim, J., Choi, Y.-J., Aghdasi, P., Nojavan, A., and Schultz, A.

The compressive strength was about 30 ksi (six times higher than conventional concrete) with a post-cracking tensile strain up to 0.6% without strength degradation. The one-day strength was approximately 12 ksi, which is more than twice that of the ultimate long-term strength of conventional concrete. UHP-FRC has very high durability due to its dense microstructure. Micro high-strength steel fibers were incorporated in the concrete mix to enhance its ductility and toughness. The excellent flowability of UHP-FRC was achieved by introducing a pozzolanic material (fly ash) which has a spherical shape. Its shape allows all the particles to roll over thereby increasing the flowability during the mixing state. The scientific basis of this invention is due to the fact that the void (or defect) dimension and entrapped air are critical factors in determining concrete strength. The voids can be minimized by high packing density, induced by combined mixing of big- and small-sized particles, e.g., coarse and fine sands, cement, glass powder, and silica fume, to achieve ultra-high compressive strength. This approach is based on the fundamental particle-stacking theory.

Broader Impacts: We conducted proof-of-concept testing with eight different industry partners: three precast companies, the City of Bedford in Texas, a design firm, an international concrete-mixer company, an FRP provider, and a shotcrete company. The results will help us explore more potential applications and obtain accurate cost analysis. Two graduate students completed their master?s degree from the support of this research and four undergraduate students (REU) have participated in project activities.

The one-step fabrication process is important because it addresses the need to develop sustainable, low cost solar manufacturing technology while maintaining high energy conversion efficiency.  It has the following unique features: it uses aluminum in a dual role to form a p-n junction in crystalline silicon while simultaneously texturizing the silicon surface to reduce reflective losses; it reduces the number of processing steps required for solar cell fabrication, and it is based on earth abundant materials. These features provide several advantages including reduced process complexity, improved sustainability, and reduced cost when compared to the leading competing process which uses gold and silver to etch the silicon surface to fabricate nanotextured solar cells in this market space.

  This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  It will investigate the use of an aluminum thin film to simultaneously serve as the p-type diffusion source for junction formation and as a catalyst to mediate nanotexturing to form an anti-reflection layer on the surface.  The effect of texturing morphology, i.e. nanowire versus nanocone, on the optical and photovoltaic properties of the devices will be studied.  Methods to passivate the nanotextured surface will be developed to reduce efficiency losses resulting from surface recombination.

Advances in manufacturing technology and cost savings due to increased production scale have caused a dramatic decrease in the cost per Watt of silicon PV technology over the past several years, but further reductions are still needed to improve the overall cost-competitiveness of PV compared to fossil fuel technology.  Several approaches are currently being pursued to improve the conversion efficiency and reduce the material costs of silicon solar cells.  These include the use of nanoscale surface texturing to increase the absorption of solar radiation and the use of thin n-type silicon wafers which enable efficient collection of photogenerated current with reduced material usage.  

This project was aimed at reducing the number of manufacturing steps required for the fabrication of nanotextured silicon photovoltaic devices based on n-type silicon wafers.  The project focused on the development of a prototype nanotextured silicon solar cell based on a one-step fabrication process that was developed at Penn State. The one-step process uses a thin film of aluminum to catalyze the growth of a nanotextured surface while simultaneously p-type doping the n-type wafer to form the p-n junction.  Penn State University partnered in this project with Bandgap Engineering and Advanced Silicon Group (ASG) Inc., leading developers of silicon nanowire solar cells. 

Extensive studies were carried out to investigate the effects of processing conditions on the growth, doping, structure and light trapping characteristics of nanotextured silicon surfaces fabricated by aluminum-catalyzed growth. Using this approach, it was possible to vary the shape of the silicon nanostructures from wire-like to pyramidal which, in turn, altered the light trapping characteristics of the nanotextured surface. Through careful control of growth conditions and substrate selection, it was possible to grow silicon nanowires with their primary axis oriented along different crystallographic directions. Subsequent studies using ultrafast spectroscopy revealed that the carrier lifetime in the aluminum-catalyzed silicon nanowires was dependent on the crystallographic direction of the nanowires due to differences in surface recombination.  In addition to materials growth, techniques were developed for solar cell device fabrication including surface passivation, post-growth annealing, electrical isolation, back-side POCl3 diffusion/contact fabrication and top side contact fabrication using an aluminum paste.  A preliminary cost model of the one-step fabrication process was also developed with guidance from Bandgap Engineering. The cost model considered capital equipment costs, labor and utility costs and estimates for device production, yield and efficiency to project a cost per Watt for the proposed manufacturing steps.

The aluminum-catalyzed growth process was found to be an effective method to form a low reflectivity nanotextured surface, however, high levels of aluminum were incorporated in the silicon during the process which rendered the material highly p-type and also produced undesired planar defects and aluminum-rich clusters in the nanotextured silicon material which ultimately impacted the device performance. Nanotextured silicon solar cells fabricated using this process exhibited excellent current rectification and a low reverse leakage current but the conversion efficiency was limited to &lt;6%.  The external quantum efficiency of the devices was significantly reduced in the shorter wavelength region of the solar spectrum due to recombination of carriers in the defective nanotextured surface layer.   Nevertheless, the project demonstrated the potential to reduce the cost per Watt of nanotextured silicon PV technology by unconventional methods that enable a reduction or elimination of steps in the manufacturing process.

The project will result in prototypes on a software defined radio platform and an FPGA platform of the dual link algorithm. The dual link algorithm has the following unique features: near optimal interference management, it is suitable for distributed implementation, it is scalable with the size of the networks, and it has fast and provable convergence. These features provide the following advantages: allows users to share frequency spectrum with asymptotic data rates that do not diminish with the increased number of users, useful for large and small networks, and able to accommodate faster channel time variation, as compared to the leading competing technology in this market space: weighted sum-rate maximization algorithms. 

This project addresses the following technology gap as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The dual link algorithm was designed under the assumption of centralized optimization and full channel knowledge of the network, while in practice, distributed implementation is desired and each node has only local channel knowledge through imperfect estimation. To bridge the gap, the project will 1) implement the dual link algorithm in distributed fashion with distributed channel and covariance matrix estimation; 2) optimize performance under constraints of hardware resource and power limits; 3) build a prototype on software defined radio platform; 4) further develop a real-time hardware IP for FPGA-based platform.

The project engages Prof. Xinming Huang's research group at Worcester Polytechnic Institute to perform hardware design and to prototype the algorithm on FPGA platform in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.

As the number of smart phone users increases, the current method of capacity growth is not sustainable, which will ultimately result in a decrease in the speed of data transfer for users.  The successful prototype demonstration of the dual link algorithm will offer a solution to accommodate the exponentially growing data demand caused by the popularity of smart phones.  The wireless communication industry is facing a capacity crunch caused by interference from more users and higher data rates and is in urgent need of such technologies translated in this project. In addition, the potential economic impact is expected to be significant for the upcoming 5G wireless networks in the next five years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the sector of wireless communication technology and service.","M.

The algorithm helps multiple transmitters jointly design their transmit signals so that the interference among them are coordinated and the total weighted sum data rate is maximized. We extended the centralized dual link algorithm to design a distributed algorithm. In the process of design and implementation of the prototype, we solved many technical issues and produced 1) optimal synchronization algorithms for timing and frequency synchronization; 2) an algorithm for internal antenna calibration for maintaining overall channel reciprocity in time division duplex multi-antenna networks; 3) Field-programmable gate array design of the computational intensive part of the algorithm involving singular value decomposition; and 4) mechanism to drive the software defined radios in a time division fashion. The above work was integrated into a prototype and a final experiment was performed. It demonstrated that the total data rate increased with the number of iterations and approached the rate as if the transmitters knew all channel states of the network. The work produced one patent and four papers so far. The results are ready to be shown to interested industry partners for the purpose of technology transfer. The project trained three Ph.D. students and four undergraduate students through NSF?s Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. They learned to deal with important practical issues that were normally ignored in theoretical study and conducted research on ideas that were motivated by practical constraints. One Ph.D. student and four undergraduate students have graduated. The Ph.D. student currently works for the wireless technology company Qualcomm Inc.. The outcome of the project helps increase wireless data communication speed, improving the productivity of the society and the daily life of people.

The project will result in a portable, hand-held, ""green"" field-ready arsenic analyzer prototype. This instrument has the following unique features: (a) it can differentiate between the more toxic arsenite from the less toxic and more easily removable arsenate (b) it can measure both down to sub parts per billion levels, (c) it is a true green analyzer that uses air, water and electricity, with a small amount of sulfuric acid that can be recycled, and (d) it offers robust performance within a very low form factor. These features provide the advantages of low cost and portability, high sensitivity, low power consumption and very low cost of consumables when compared to the electrochemical instruments for arsenic currently available in this market space. This project addresses the technology gap of converting the original bench-top proof-of-concept to an instrument with a small, attractive form factor in a user-friendly form as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.

The project engages Chipotle Business Group Inc. to augment their water analysis capabilities, provide field testing environment for the device during development, conduct a market study to identify customer segments, and develop pathways to commercialization for the instrument in this technology translation effort.

This green analyzer for arsenic is important because it bridges the gap between an academic analytical instrument and a low-cost commercial device that will help humanity. This technology will help the millions of people, especially from the developing countries across the world, who are at the risk of being affected by arsenicosis, which is caused by chronic arsenic exposure through drinking water. Arsenic is the 20th most abundant element in the earth?s crust. Even in developed countries there are many areas where groundwater arsenic concentration is high; this technology will be helpful in implementing water quality control regulations and monitoring the efficacy of arsenic removal efforts.","Ghosh, A. K.; Das, A. N.; Dasgupta, P. K.~A Fast, Accurate, Speciation-Capable, Automated, and Green Gas-Phase Chemiluminescence Approach for Analyzing Waterborne Arsenic.~LC.GC~33~2015~http://ww~~~0~ ~0~ ~20/04/2016 22:35:59.340000000",,"Arsenic in drinking water has become a major problem in many parts of the world. It is a class A human carcinogen. In the Gangetic delta of India and Bangladesh, this has assumed calamitous proportions, with 600,000 diagnosed cases of arsenicosis and potentially 20 million people at risk.  Arsenic is the 20th most abundant element in the Earth?s crust. In the wake of greatly increased hydraulic fracturing and other unconventional energy exploration efforts, ground water arsenic levels in affected parts of the United States have also reported to be rising. 

 

Arsenic is a powerful toxin, the current regulatory limit is 10 parts per billion in water, equivalent to about one-tenth of a teaspoon of the pure material in an average residential ~13,000 gallon swimming pool. Water borne arsenic also exists in two chemical forms, trivalent and pentavalent arsenic (designated As(III) and As(V), respectively. At higher concentrations, the former is more toxic and is more difficult to remove than the latter; however, at low levels as they may exist in water, this difference in toxicity between the two forms may not exist.

 

Reliable, reproducible, affordable measurement of arsenic in water that can be carried out in a field-portable format using chemicals that are not themselves toxic has proven elusive.  A desirable instrument should be able to measure considerably below the regulatory limit such that performance of filters or other remediation measures can be judged and one can determine early when the capacity of such filters are coming close to exhaustion. The ability to specifically measure how much arsenic exists in each form is also beneficial as this may dictate the nature of the remediation measure chosen or dictate the need for pretreatment prior to mediation.

 

In this project, we have taken technology previously developed under NSF sponsorship, and built three prototypes to attract investment and commercialization.  The principle involves generation of arsine gas from arsenic in water; the arsine then reacts with in-situ generated ozone gas to produce chemiluminescence in a highly selective reaction.  The emitted light intensity is measured as a measure of arsenic.  The conversion of dissolved arsenic to arsine gas can be carried out at different levels of acidity; in a strongly acid solution, both forms of arsenic react to make arsine.  In modestly acidic solutions (pH ~4-4.5), only As(III) responds. This principle is exploited to make an oxidation-state speciated measurement.

 

Three commercial prototype analyzer in two different varieties (laboratory benchtop vs. field-portable) were built.  They rely on the same basic principle and hardware except for the power source (plug-in 110V AC power vs. Li-ion battery) and the control/command interface (laptop computer vs. microprocessor/touchscreen interface). One instrument was extensively tested by a third party laboratory (TTI Environmental Laboratories, Arlington, TX) that indicated the instrument is capable of both sub-parts per billion limits of detection and the ability to provide speciation between As(III) and As(V). In default configuration, the instrument response is linear to 250 ppb arsenic. The evaluation reports are available upon request. The business partner in the project, Lumion Laboratories, is presently actively seeking funds to take the instrument to market.

Based on the innovation we previously made on developing such a replacement based on silver nanowire-polymer composite electrode, the project was focused on resolving a major issue that hinders the commercial application of this new material, that is, the thermal instability of silver nanowires and the polymer substrate. A flexible transparent conductive electrode was innovated with extremely smooth topography capable of withstanding thermal processing at 300 &deg;C for at least 6 hours with little change in sheet resistance and optical clarity. In depth investigation was performed on atomic layer deposited zinc oxide on silver nanowires with regard to thermal and atmospheric corrosion stability. The ZnO coated nanowire networks were embedded within a polyimide matrix, and the &lt;2 nm roughness freestanding electrode was used to fabricate white organic light emitting diodes. The obtained OLED exhibited comparable performance to ITO/glass based devices, verifying its efficacy for use in optoelectronic devices requiring high processing temperatures. With further modification of the composite electrode, and the use of a thin glass substrate, we also achieved OLEDs that exhibited 2X efficiency compared to control devices on ITO/glass. Scaling of the fabrication process for the composite electrode produced letter size composite electrodes. Commercialization potential of the composite electrode was explored, with further market survey and technical analyses.

An invention was made in the project for which a US provisional patent application was filed. This invention helps overcome a major issue that hinders the technology transfer.

Four graduate students, a postdoctoral fellow, and an undergraduate student participated in the multidisciplinary project, received education and developed research skills with the project. One graduate student gained significant entrepreneurship experiences in the project through team/partnership that included students, faculty member, IP office, MBA, and start-up company to facilitate the technology transition. This student also made a technology pitch presentation at the NSF SBIR grantee conference. The undergraduate student extensively participated in the project research, and co-authored a paper produced in this project.

The next step necessary for commercialization is to demonstrate how the process can be automated. The project will result in a proof-of-concept set of software tools that will take a collection of identified invariants and micro-specialize the DBMS source code automatically.

The enhanced version of those tools will have the following unique features: it will be (i) scalable, i.e., can handle realistic DBMS code bases, up to millions of lines of source code, with acceptable performance; (ii) robust, i.e., able to handle language features that can be tricky for compilers; and (iii) effective, i.e., able to generate high-quality specialized code that realizes the desired performance improvements. These features provide the following two main advantages. First, it does not require an expensive and time-consuming rewrite of the DBMS source code, but can be applied to existing DBMS code. Second, it is independent of, and orthogonal to, other approaches to DBMS performance improvement measures. This means that any investments a DBMS vendor may have made in developing other performance improvement technologies are not nullified by our approach; rather, our approach further enhances the effects of those technologies by producing additional improvements in performance.

This project addresses the following technology gap as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application, that of automating micro-specialization. It is not practical for these vendors to manually perform micro-specialization on the end-user DBMSes since micro-specialization tailors the DBMS code to the specifics of an installation and so is different for different installations. Rather, what the vendors will want, and the product we will provide, is a software development environment that allows developers to quickly, efficiently, and reliably perform micro-specialization on their customers' DBMSes, that they then license to their customers: the DBMS end users. In order to commercialize our idea, therefore, we next have to show that the process can be largely automated.

The project engages Dataware Ventures to be responsible for the development side of the project, focusing on large-scale testing and refinement of the functionality and efficacy of the code specialization algorithms developed by researchers at the University of Arizona. Specifically, Dataware Ventures will perform software development, carry out large-scale testing and evaluation, and provide relevant feedback to UA researchers, aiding in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.

DBMS micro-specialization is important because most organizations with non-trivial data processing needs, including virtually all medium and large businesses and corporations, rely on enterprise application systems for their data processing and analysis. These applications generally run on top of a DBMS, which handles the actual storage and retrieval of data. The performance of the underlying DBMS, i.e., its ability to process large amounts of data within an acceptable amount of time, is therefore of crucial importance for providing timely and accurate information to business decision makers. In addition, the potential economic impact is expected to grow to $157B in the next three years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in enterprise application systems and in the underlying technology of database management systems.",,,,THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA

The project will result in the development of a prototype system consisting of a UAV and a ground station with associated software that can provide the firefighting ""Incident Management Teams"" with advanced situational awareness capabilities during wildfire and structural fire scenarios. This UAV based system has the following unique features: i) ease-of-use by firefighting professionals in managing UAV operations; ii) quick deployment; and iii) real-time acquisition and processing of information gathered by UAV in order to provide not only a current situational picture but also predictive ability in case of wildfires. These features provide advantages including reduced cost of operation and improved safety of lives and properties as compared with current methodologies such as manned aircraft based surveillance, satellite imageries, and manual lookout practices.   

This project addresses a number of technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. For example, the conversion of data gathered from UAVs in the form of telemetry and streaming video into an intuitive form easily understandable by firefighters requires innovations in real-time video processing, spatio-temporal estimation, systematic combination of information from multiple sources, and information presentation and visualization. Similarly, intended use by firefighting professionals, who are not trained pilots, and other practical constraints require the UAV operations to be autonomous and algorithms to be computationally efficient.

The project engages partners from the University of Toledo Technology Transfer Office, Kayos Enterprise, Inc., West Virginia Division of Forestry, and the Cincinnati Fire Department to guide the commercialization process, augment the research capability, provide a testing environment, and offer an understanding of users' needs and perspectives in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.

The proposed UAV based technology is important because it puts tools in hands of wildfire and structural fire incident commanders so they can obtain improved situational awareness for making timely and informed decisions. This is expected to result in substantial cost savings, improved levels of safety, lower loss of life and property, and augmented preservation of the environment. With the imminent inclusion of UAVs in the national airspace, the technologies developed in this research have wide potential in a number of other civilian applications such as law enforcement, border patrol, and perimeter surveillance.

The project will result in a proof-of-concept blood typing microdevice to simultaneously detect cell signatures without a microscope. This blood typing microdevice has the following unique features: portability, rapid ABO-Rh type identification, no reagents, simultaneous hematocrit determination, and small blood volumes. These features provide the following advantages: time- and cost-savings, increased efficiency, longer shelf life, and better reliability when compared to paper-based blood agglutination kits, the leading competitor in this market space. While most electrokinetic/microfluidic devices fit on handheld microscope slides, the supporting infrastructure to operate the device comprises a considerable cost and space footprint.  This project addresses this technology gap by developing sensing electrodes to replace the optical microscope?s role of recording red blood cell responses in the microdevice, facilitating a key step in the transition from research discovery toward a user-friendly commercial application. 

This blood typing microdevice is important because trauma centers and hospitals rely extensively on blood donations provided by blood banks across the U.S to save lives. There are currently 84 million blood typings per year in the U.S., with approximately 16 million donations annually. Processing costs approach $200 per pint of blood, so the ability to pre-screen donors by blood type and selectively direct the donation process (i.e. plasma, red cells) would result in significant savings and bolster our declining blood supply. This portable technology could also be translated to remote geographical locations for disaster relief applications. In addition, the potential initial economic impact is expected to be up to $12 million per year, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in healthcare including trauma, blood therapies, and surgeries.",,,"The focus of this project was to explore the feasibility of passive electrical measurements to discern biological cell location within a microfluidic device.  This approach would replace optical microscope observation of cell location.   We previously demonstrated the use of dielectrophoretic response curves to discern ABO-Rh types of red blood cells in a microfluidic chamber ~350 &mu;m in diameter.  The passive electrical measurements were integrated into this chamber.   Details are not disclosed here because the work is being commercialized by a spin-off company, MicroDevice Engineering, Inc.

Significant results included designs and microfabrication of multiple layers of metals and dielectrics within a test region that could passively measure biological cells on the surface.  Metals and dielectrics were selected to enable concurrent optical verification of the electrical measurements.  Parametric studies were conducted to ascertain the spatial sensitivity of the measurements including cell position and cell concentrations.  Interactions with concurrent electrical signals were also measured.  Research experiences for undergraduates were also included with the parent project.  A total of three undergraduates (two African-American female students) participated by using the microchips to complete parametric studies on the accuracy of the measurements in the presence of secondary flows, passive capillary force loading of the channels and chambers, as well as the design and testing of a LED/photodiode Arduino configuration to detect cell concentration. 

In summary, the key outcomes were the design, testing, and implementation of a non-optical detection method for biological cell location within a microfluidic device.  The technique enabled monitoring of cell location in near-real-time such that response curves as a function of other microdevice operational parameters could be obtained.  The designs from this work were utilized in the ongoing R&amp;D for a portable blood typing and hematocrit detection unit for blood donation centers.  These centers aim to utilize the devices to advise and route volunteer donors. 

One patent is pending, and one manuscript is under review at this point in time.

During the entire life of the award, the major outcomes is the development of a novel desktop DSIF machine applied in the new dieless incremental forming process.  

A new topological structure of three degree of freedom translational parallel kinematic manipulator was presented as Tri-pyramid Robot to overcome the drawback of conventional parallel/serial manipulators for highly accurate tool positioning applications. Displacement groups of presented new parallel kinematic manipulator were analyzed to verify the overconstrained motions in all subchains. The related inverse/forward kinematic solutions, workspace, structural parameters optimization, interference checking, kinetostatic and stiffness modeling were developed for the design, fabrication and control of the new parallel machine. A new compliant parallel mechanism was designed to meet the requirements of micro DSIF process. Both of high stiffness and large amplified displacement were implemented in the designs. A new quick slide clamping system was designed to simplify the specimen setup, and facilitate the practical operation in DSIF process.

All of designs resulted in a complete prototype of DSIF machine including the mechanical assembly and the related control integration. In order to enhance the accuracy of the motions due to the assembly errors, a complete analytical error model was developed and built in the calibration control algorithm. Several dieless sheet parts were formed to test the formability of the desktop machine. The freeform shapes aluminum sheet parts were formed by the incremental forming dieless process. The spiral/contour incremental tool paths were used in the motion control algorithm.

In order to commercialize the new DSIF desktop machine and forming technology, the prototype was presented at the IMTS 2016 (International Manufacturing Technology Show) in Chicago. In the IMTS 2016, the new Tri-pyramid robots and the DSIF technology attracted hundreds visitors every day. The work was disseminated by the demos and the machine/technology introductions. During the show, the mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel and many school students and commercial users visited the booth and queried the new technology. The related work was interacted with other different companies for the potential future commercialization.

The research were presented and published on international journals and one US patent. The results obtained from this research will contribute directly to the scientific base for advanced manufacturing. The work provides insight into the complex motion control and calibration, can direct applications effectively. The technique used in the developed analytical model provides an alternative technique to develop new machine tools, especially in the parallel kinematic mechanism applications. The embedded design, modeling, analysis and control method for the double sided incremental forming process can be further expanded and adapted to other broader commercial applications outside of sheet metal forming, such as the areas of high precision milling, positioning stages, high speed manipulation for pick-place operations, and general robotic assembly operations. The effect of machine design field on parallel kinematic mechanism will especially be a topic that has broad impact.

The project will result in a functional prototype of a multi-cylinder variable displacement linkage pump. This adjustable linkage pump has the following novel features: 1) it uses low friction pin joints, 2) it can reach true zero displacement, 3) the piston reaches the same top dead center position regardless of the displacement, and 4) it can pump corrosive fluids.  These features improve efficiency and allow the pump to be used in a wide range of applications and environments, when compared to market leading variable displacement hydraulic pumps.  This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: constructing a dynamic model of the pump, constructing a framework for multi-domain multi-objective optimization of machines with mechanisms and applying the method to optimize the pump for water pumping applications, and designing and testing a multi-cylinder prototype.

This project engages CAT Pumps, a leader in fixed displacement linkage pump manufacturing, to aid in the design for manufacturing and prototyping process. They will give guidance on customer requirements in this technology translation effort from research discovery towards commercial reality.

The variable displacement linkage pump is a disruptive technology for fluid power and fluid conveyance markets by providing a broadly applicable highly efficient variable displacement pump.  The energy savings from the use of the highly efficient pump directly result in a reduction in fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, the pump can easily operate with water, which enables the fluid power industry to transition to environmentally friendly water hydraulics, eliminating damaging oil leaks and spills.  In addition, there is a projected $15-30M in revenue over the next four years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the fluid power and fluid conveyance markets.","Wilhelm, S., and Van de Ven, J.~Efficiency Testing of an Adjustable Linkage Triplex Pump~ASME/BATH 2014 Symposium on Fluid Power & Motion Control, Bath, United Kingdom~~2014~FPMC2014-~~~0~ ~0~ ~06/02/2017 11:41:16.53000000, Wilhelm, Shawn and Van de Ven, James~Adjustable Linkage Pump: Efficiency Modeling and Experimental Validation~Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics~7~2015~031013~~10.1115/1.40282~0~ ~0~ ~10/03/2016 21:41:39.950000000, Wilhelm, S., and Van de Ven, J.~A Linkage Driven Variable Displacement Pump~2015 Fluid Power Innovation & Research Conference, Chicago, IL~~2015~~~~0~ ~0~ ~06/02/2017 11:41:16.56000000, Wilhelm, S., and Van de Ven, J.~Adjustable Linkage Pump: Efficiency Modeling and Experimental Validation~Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics~7~2015~031013~~~0~ ~0~ ~06/02/2017 11:41:16.66000000, Knutson, Anthony

This novel pump architecture is highly efficient across a wide range of operating conditions and can pump a variety of fluids.  The pump mechanism uses an adjustable six-bar linkage to change the piston displacement, allowing continuous piston stroke variability down to zero.  A dynamic model of the pump was constructed that captures the kinematics and kinetics of the linkage, fluid dynamics in the piston-cylinder interface, dynamics of the check valves, and flow dynamics through the manifolds.  This model was used to predict the volumetric and mechanical efficiency, as well as the flow and pressure ripple of the pump.  A multi-domain multi-objective optimization of the pump was performed for the application of high-pressure water pumping for pressure washer applications.  The detailed design of an inline three-cylinder linkage pump was completed.  Innovations of the mechanical design included: 1) double shear joints to reduce out-of-plane deflection, 2) a multi-piece split crankshaft for easy manufacturing and assembly, 3) a split connecting rod for easy bearing installation, and 4) positive elastomer seals with ceramic piston for water compatibility.  A prototype pump was fabricated and assembled.  Efficiency maps and pressure ripple data were experimentally generated on a test stand, demonstrating good model agreement.  In collaboration with our industry partner, a pressure-compensation automatic displacement control system was modeled, designed, and manufactured.  The displacement control system demonstrated good tracking of a flow rate square wave function, with a response time of 0.13 sec.  In addition to the technical tasks, the team performed extensive market research to identify market opportunities for future commercialization, infusing an entrepreneurial mindset into an academic project.  The variable displacement linkage pump has the opportunity to be paradigm shifting in the hydraulics and fluid transfer markets due to the high efficiency across a wide range of operating conditions and ability to pump a variety of fluids.

This system will constitute a new anti-counterfeiting and authentication technology to fill the need for fighting the staggering counterfeiting and intellectual-property losses suffered across a broad range of industries.   The project will result in a prototype of a complete Print-Read-Decode system for RGB upconverting inks.  This Print-Read-Decode system will have the following unique features: it will be based on inks activated with nanocrystals which are responsible for the upconversion luminescence; the covert markings are invisible under ambient and UV lighting, and only become visible under NIR light; it will be based on the only known print system demonstrated to fill the RGB color space using upconversion luminescence; and it will be a closed-loop system, in which the entire system, from printing, to encoding, to reading and decoding will be included within one system. These features provide advantages when compared to the leading competing security inks and marking systems due to increased difficulty to counterfeit. Specifically, the ability to replicate would require reproduction of not only the inks (which are intrinsically difficult to reproduce), but of the entire system. This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application, the development of a cyber-enabled, integrated reader; and adaptation of the current ink formulations to accommodate industry-friendly equipment and processes.  The project engages Midwest Micro-Tek in Brookings, SD to augment its research capabilities and to provide a suitable test environment in this technology translation effort.

The Print-Read-Decode prototype for RGB upconverting inks is important because counterfeit goods cost U.S. businesses $200-$250 billion annually, and are directly responsible for the loss of 750,000 American jobs. Beyond the dollar costs, counterfeit drugs are a proven danger to public health and safety. Counterfeit integrated circuits and electronic components are a threat to the full functionality of national defense systems. In addition, the economic impact of the $2 billion mass serialization track-and-trace market is predicted to expand to $75 billion in less than three years. Success in combating counterfeiting will require numerous creative approaches; a single market-dominant anti-counterfeiting technology seems unrealistic and even dangerous. If the proposed system captures a mere one percent of the predicted market within three years, the economic impact would be $750,000,000.","P.S. May, J. Kellar, J. Wright, G. Crawford, J. Meruga, A.

One reader is completely standalone and is intended for demonstration and marketing purposes.  The second design is a modification of the first and can be controlled by, and pass information to, a Smartphone.  These reader designs are made to be manufacture friendly and were developed to this stage under consultation with industry partners. These designs are protected under a provisional patent.

 

An effective business team was assembled and a company, NP Integrated Systems, was formed, dedicated to the commercialization of our technology. Our team entered the South Dakota Governor?s Giant Vision competition, in which South Dakota companies compete for the best new business idea.  This competition is held in Sioux Falls, SD, in conjunction with the Conference for the Governor?s Office of Economic Development. Our team won 1st prize in the Governor?s Giant Vision competition which includes a $20,000 prize.

 

The technology has been licensed to SecureMarking (www.securemarking.com), formerly NP Integrated Systems, which is currently conducting an NSF Phase I STTR project based on the technology.  Moreover, SecureMarking was selected to participate in the Techstars Air Force Accelerator in Boston in 2018, a program designed to help promising startup companies to succeed.   This is a highly selective program in which only the 10 most promising companies are chosen to participate.  Techstar companies have a very good record of attracting funding and becoming successful.

 

This project provided 6 months of support for a postdoctoral associate, who not only worked intimately with the project team on ink formulation / printing, but also participated in an intensive entrepreneurial training program (SDBTC Accelerator Program).  This associate, therefore, benefited from a unique training program combining science, business, and technology transfer.  This training paid off, as the associate is the PI on a current Phase I STTR grant based on this technology mentioned above.

 

This project has had an exceptionally strong impact on the training and professional development of undergraduate students.  Eight undergraduate students have been substantially involved in this project, and several of them have contributed enormously to the project?s success.  Three of the undergraduates are named as inventors on patent applications and three others are co-authors on articles published in high-impact international journals.

AAMR exploits strain effected by surface acoustic waves to temporarily reduce the magnetic field required to write on the disk and enable higher data density. The project will establish proof-of-concept of a non-contact transducer for generating focused surface acoustic waves in the storage medium for selectively addressing individual data bits. 

In comparison to other competing strategies presently being considered, namely bit-patterned media recording, heat-assisted magnetic recording and microwave-assisted magnetic recording, AAMR (1) does not require expensive patterning of the storage media, (2) precludes thermal loading and cycling issues, and (3) provides the possibility of simpler sub-system integration. The basic principles of AAMR have been proven in previous work. The technology gap to be addressed in this project is the demonstration of an acoustic transducer suitable for integration with a commercial recording head, an important and necessary step towards establishing the technical feasibility and commercial reality of AAMR.

Magnetic hard disk drives have long been the mainstay for data storage, and, despite threat from solid-state memory technologies, are expected to continue to dominate the market due to their cost-competitiveness ($0.05-$0.10 per gigabyte versus solid-state storage at $1.20-$2.00 per gigabyte). Currently hard disk drives constitute a $40 billion industry with nearly 90% of the market share held by two U.S. companies. Demand for storage is further predicted to grow exponentially, spurred by the needs of big data, cloud and supercomputing technologies. These statistics underscore the likely significant economic impact and pay-off of successfully translating AAMR to the marketplace.","P. Chowdhury, P. Dhagat, and A.

The successful demonstration of such a means would address a key technology gap in an innovation, namely, acoustically assisted magnetic data storage, realized and patented under an earlier National Science Foundation supported effort. Compared to other hard-disk drive information storage technologies being developed to meet big data, cloud and supercomputing, needs, acoustically assisted magnetic recording promises to be robust, less expensive and simpler-to-implement. The economic impact of commercializing this technology can be expected to be significant, given that magnetic hard-disk drives constitute a $40 billion industry dominated by U.S. companies.

Acoustically assisted data storage is based on generating strain to lower the magnetic hardness (or coercivity) of the given magnetic film, to enable data to be recorded in it. The project effort focused on the modeling, fabrication and evaluation of non-contact acoustic transducers, similar to those used for non-destructively detecting hidden defects in metal parts, for generating surface acoustic waves and thereby strain in the magnetic film. While modeling results verified the feasibility of thus generating strain, experimental efforts did not lead to a successful demonstration. The project, nevertheless, resulted in the development of new techniques for measuring change in magnetic coercivity with strain in magnetic thin films. These techniques are relevant also for developing smart, shape-memory magnetic materials for sensing and actuation. Six graduate and four undergraduate students gained rich and varied skills &ndash; from device modeling and fabrication experience to developing commercialization plans. The effort also seeded a new research area in novel, nonlinear signal processing devices based on interactions between acoustic waves and magnetic spin waves. Successful outcomes of this project were reported via juried publications and presentations at national and international conferences and workshops.

To do so is critical in order to motivate consumers to renounce current petro-derived materials for new-to-the-world bioplastics such as those proposed herein.  The strategy pursued by the project team is to utilize bioplastics with the right combination of properties while focusing on engineering the interface or boundaries between these components to optimize material performance.   Specifically, selected material components include cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs), poly (omega-hydroxyfatty acids (P (omega-OHFAs)), and poly (lactic acid) (PLA). While P (omeg-OHFAs) provides good hydrolytic stability and physical toughness, the PLA-CNW nanocomposites provide high modulus and improved use temperatures. The knowledge-enhance partner (KEP) small businesses in this project, PolyNew Inc. (engineered CNWs) and SyntheZyme LLC (P(omega-OHFAs) and their blends with PLA), bring together the required technologies to exploit synergies that will result by the judicious combination of materials to provide superior performance 100% biobased bioplastics.  The production of omega-OHFAs will be performed by using SyntheZyme's newly engineered yeast strain that provides the first efficient biotechnological route to convert fatty acids to omega-HOFAs.  P(omega-HOFAs) have properties similar to medium density polyethylene (PE). However, unlike PE, P(omega-HOFAs) contain ester groups separated by 13 to 17 methylene (CH2) units. Thus, P(omega-HOFAs) provide important PE-like properties such as water resistance and excellent ductility while retaining chemical reactivity so they can be reactive blended with PLA and strengthened by CNWs. PolyNew Inc. and SyntheZyme LLC will work together to develop technologies by which CNWs are functionalized to engineer interactions with blended P(omega-HOFAs) and PLAs. The impressive performance of CNWs derives from their aspect ratio that enables them to reach their percolation threshold (e.g., where long-range connectivity is achieved within the material) at relatively low loadings, resulting in impressive modulus increases. Preliminary work has shown that P (omega-OHFAs)/PLA blends show promising properties that would greatly benefit by incorporation of specifically functionalized CNWs. 

The broader impacts of this research to society at large are many. The project is consistent with Federal policies supporting greater use of biobased products including the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, which is designed to ensure that a sufficiently large base of new, non-food, non-feed biomass crops is established to meet demands for renewable energy and bioproducts. Socially, there are advantages associated with employment in the plastics, forestry and agriculture sectors of the economy--the project strongly supports Green Jobs creation. Reductions in petroleum dependence (even relatively modest ones) are also considered beneficial. Teaching and training will be promoted and considerable outreach activities will be pursued. Previous success in incorporating underrepresented groups (women, Hispanics, and African Americans) in research activities will be continued.

Partners at the inception of the project are the Knowledge-Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of NYU-POLY (Brooklyn, NY) and two small businesses partner companies: SyntheZyme LLC (Brooklyn, NY), a small business with private stock holders; and PolyNew Inc. (Golden, CO), a privately held woman-owned small business. Other partners are academic institutional organizations: University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus (CO), Colorado School of Mines (CO), NYU Langone Medical Center (NY), NYU College of Dentistry (NY),
Memorial Sloan Kettering Institute (NY), and the Denver School for Science and Technology (DSST) (CO);  private sector organizations: Fish & Richardson; Smith, Gambrell & Russell, LLP; Berenbaum & Weinsheienk; Sealed Air; Dart Packaging; DSM; ADM; NatureWorks; Lubrizol; BASF and Pepsico; and public sector organizations: Aurora Economic Development Council (AEDC), New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), Colorado Bioscience Association (CBSA), Colorado Institute for Drug, Device and Diagnostic Development (CID4), Colorado Office for Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT), Colorado Small Business Development Centers (SBDC), and Fitzsimons BioBusiness Partners (FBBp) & Fitzsimons Redevelopment Authority (FRA) (Aurora, CO).",,,"Project Summary: This program addressed the need to develop bioplastics that overcome limitations in their mechanical and barrier properties. Achieving this goal by cost-efficient technologies is critically important so that bioplastics can compete on a cost-performance basis with existing petroleum derived materials. Polylactic acid from L-lactide (PLLA) was chosen as the primary target as it is available commercially and has property deficiencies that, if overcome, will improve PLA-based material cost-performance and allow its use in a broader range of applications.  The primary strategy pursued to achieve these improvements was the development of cellulose-derived nanofibers that are functionalized with appropriate groups to facilitate their dispersion in polymer matrices during melt-blending. Property improvements targeted include enhancing PLLA strength, heat distortion temperature (HDT, temperature at which a plastic sample deforms) and barrier properties (e.g. decrease oxygen permeability).  In addition, work was performed to improve PLLAs impact resistance and ductility without compromising other valued PLLA properties.

1)   Intellectual Merit: The ability to obtain high nanofiber dispersions in blends is directly related to the desired material property improvements. Hence, the fundamental challenge is to develop methods by which CNCs can be synthesized with fine-control of their surface chemistry to optimize matrix-fiber interactions by a process that is simple, scalable, green and versatile. This was accomplished by crafting a one-pot (e.g. using one reaction vessel) reaction where cellulose from ramie or cotton linters is combined with an organic acid and hydrochloric acid (HCl) (Figure 1). Reaction parameters (e.g. temperature, HCl concentration, reaction time) were systematically varied to optimize modified CNCs yields. We learned that optimal reaction parameters varied considerably for each organic acid studied (e.g. citric, lactic, acetic, acrylic and levulinic acids). Nevertheless, by this approach, and by invoking recycling strategies to re-use residual cellulose, yields of up to about 50% CNCs were obtained. In one example, when surface modified CNCs esterified with lactic acid, acetic acid and non-modified were compared, we showed that far superior improvements in PLLA properties were achieved with lactic acid esterified CNCs (LA-CNCs). Indeed, at 5 wt-% loading of LA-CNCs, enhancements in PLLAs storage modulus below and above its glass transition temperature were 31 and 450 %, respectively (Figure 2 and 3). Direct visualization by atomic force microscopy showed that, relative to non-modified and acetic acid esterified CNCs, LA-CNCs were best dispersed (lowest tendency to aggregate) in the PLA matrix. Further improvements in the performance benefits from LA-CNC were realized by developing a method of chemically linking (e.g. grafting) long PLA chains of the opposite (D-) stereochemistry (PDLA) to CNC fibers. By this strategy, PLLA and PDLA form a unique crystal structure (a stereocomplex) that is high melting and enhances the fiber-matrix interactions. Melt blending of PLLA, non-grafted PDLA and CNC with PDLA grafts (75:25:15 by-wt, respectively) resulted in an increase in the HDT by 32 &deg;C (to 110 &deg;C) relative to neat PLA.  This improvement in the HDT is sufficient to allow contact of this material with boiling water.  This work and other studies during the course of the program demonstrated how the dispersion of CNCs in PLLA matrices is profoundly influenced by relatively small changes in CNC modification chemistry.

 P(&omega;-HOC14) is a unique biopolyester developed by SyntheZyme that is 100% biobased and fully biodegradable in compost environments (Figure 5). We discovered that, by incorporating relatively rubbery P(w-HOC14) domains within the PLLA matrix, PLLA can be transformed from brittle to ductile without significant loss in material strength. For example, reactive blending of PLLA/P(&o...",RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE

Project: Building Innovation Capacity through Partnerships in Innovation in Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices

NSF Award ID: 1318202

Report Period: Final Progress Report; 08/01/2013-07/31/2016

 

This building innovation capacity project has the focus on the advanced research in electrical energy storage using ultracapacitors and power systems using electrolyte capacitors.  In this project we created environmentally benign electroactive materials, configured them in unique structural forms at low cost and demonstrated their application for efficient electrical energy storage. By eliminating the toxic liquid electrolytes with safe ionic liquid gels, we improved the form factor and safety of the electrical energy storage devices for pervasive human use. Using this approach in this project, we created ultracapacitors over solid-state and flexible platforms.  By integrating these with the solar panels, we successfully demonstrated efficient storage of solar cell generated electricity.  This has potential use in overcoming temporal change in solar radiation from affecting the power quality by supplementing it from stored electric energy.

We worked with partner industry to evaluate materials and devices efficacy and identified the diverse business opportunities in the area of dense energy storage, efficiency enhancement and power quality.  By encouraging student participation in this project, we improved their success in energy related engineering and technology objectives.  By building partnership between research group and industry, we helped students in their professional development and in new career opportunities.  The feedback from industry-university research partnership led us to identify the educational needs in the area of engineering aspects of the energy storage. To address this, we developed a new course curriculum in electrical energy storage systems and applications which will be offered to the graduate level students beginning spring 2017.

We encouraged wider faculty research group involvement which was a factor in developing new research interest in the energy and power area. The original research contributions by the students and the involved faculty which describes their success and new research findings were widely disseminated in peer reviewed journal and conference publications and by making presentations in the specialized national and state conferences in the area of energy materials and energy storage devices.

Spider silks exhibit excellent strength and toughness simultaneously, a feat unachievable in most synthetic structural materials, and it has a thermal conductivity equivalent to copper. At USU, recombinant silks closely mimicking natural spider silk sequences have been developed and synthesized. The discovery and early development of spider silk?s properties has led to the current point of joint technology-oriented research with business and industry partners. Three industry partners and one non-profit collaborator all have potential of developing spider silk products. This project will produce bio-inspired fibers with materials properties specifically appropriate for each of the partnering companies? possible product prototypes. This research will combine expertise and resources to make it possible to move spider silk technology toward products in three distinct areas: 1) biomedical applications, in particular micro-fine sutures for eye and nerve surgery; 2) composite materials from synthetic spider silk fibers; and 3) media for microbial fermentation and synthetic feed for silkworms designed to augment typical materials for production of the unique proteins.  In addition, the unique thermal transfer properties of spider silk will be explored to assess its use in a variety of applications. The research will focus on which synthetic spider silks will be the best for the different possible uses, how to scale-up production of those spider silk proteins to levels that can be commercialized, and how to incorporate these fibers into the companies? prospective prototypes.  


The broader impacts of the research lie in the potential of the partnership to develop the products and techniques described above that will open up new markets due to the unique properties of these materials, which cannot currently be matched by any other materials.   The new products envisioned would substantially increase the revenue for the partner companies, open up new product lines, and likely lead to increased jobs for them and downstream businesses. The companies will directly gain new technical skills such as electrospinning, fiber testing, methods for handling unique fibers, and testing methods for new feed media. In return, the Lewis Laboratory at USU will gain experience in composite material design and manufacture, 3D printing, rapid prototyping techniques, and methods for media analyses. Both the companies and the USU laboratory will gain access to unique instrumentation aiding both academe and industry in the future development of products from these unique materials.  Also, importantly the development of media and diets to improve the production of the silk fibers will be crucial for production to meet expected demand. These partnerships can also lead to the use of spider silk in additional products in other companies. In addition to the research scientists participating in this project, students involved in this project will also gain valuable experience working with industry partners and with company scientists not only in the research, but also in the planning and design phases. Students will also have opportunities to present on their research and work with the PI in outreach efforts to give several presentations and tours on spiders and spider silk to K-12 students. The project will also provide hands-on workshops for the Engineering State conference for high school students with a particular goal of recruiting women and Hispanic students. This research area has continued to produce enthusiastic media attention for both the PI?s research and sponsors in the U.S. and internationally from multiple television networks.

1) increase recombinant spider silk protein (rSSP) production in bacteria

2) improve spinning process for rSSPs to increase tensile strength

3) improve mechanical properties of transgenic silkworm silk

4) develop new rSSP based non-fiber materials

5) continue and develop new collaborations with our corporate partners

Major Accomplishments are:

1) We increased the production of spider silk protein (rSSP) to as high as 3.6g of protein per liter of bacterial culture.  This was the result of both increases in bacteria produced per L and the amount of protein produced per bacteria.  The rSSP purification protocol has been streamlined with a substantial reduction in cost.  The overall process has been scaled to 1000L.

2) Improvements in the spinning process have been incremental focusing on determining the best combinations of protein concentration, stretch ratios and stretch baths.  Two substantial accomplishments were the development of a spinning head that can produce 8 simultaneous fibers and production of fibers that are as strong as 6/0 commercial suture material. 

3) The research effort in the transgenic silkworm arena has been focused on increasing the level of spider silk protein in the cocoon fibers. This has led to an increase to 10-15% spider silk protein in the cocoons of these transgenic silkworms.  It has also led to tensile strengths approaching those of spider silk dragline fibers.

4) Non-fiber based spider silk protein materials have become a major focus in the laboratory during the grant period.  These include: films, coatings, hydro- and lyo-gels, sponges and adhesives.  The key to this entire line of research was the discovery that a combination of heat and pressure, using a microwave oven, would solubilize the spider silk proteins in water.  We have found that with this method we can include a variety of additives such as antibiotics, growth factors and anti-clotting agents to create a wide variety of possible applications and products.  Two papers have been published on these topics, another is submitted with revisions and fourth is in preparation. 

5) Collaborative efforts with both BST and Caisson Labs were not as successful as had hoped.  However, several new corporate partners have come on board and are particularly interested in the non-fiber uses for rSSPs as well as fibers. Fiber uses are currently focused on micro-sutures and fibers for composite materials.  The non-fiber uses are for dental implants, coatings for catheters and other medical implants and adhesives.

6)  Three papers have been published with three more in various stages of writing.  One patent has been issued and two others are be readied for submission.

The biggest limitation for currently commercialized low temperature fuel cells is the high cost and degradation of membranes and platinum-based electrocatalysts. AEM-DEFCs have several key advantages over these fuel cells: (1) faster, more efficient oxygen and ethanol reactions to produce more energy with less raw material; (2) wider choices of cheaper, non-platinum electrodes; (3) greater stability of fuel cell components; and (4) increased fuel safety and portability by using bio-ethanol. Since 2008, the PI's team has innovated and patented the technology for affordable, highly efficient polymeric electrolyte membranes and catalysts in anion-exchange-membrane fuel cells. The remaining challenge for advancing this early-stage technology to the marketplace is demonstrating its stability and efficiency in a wide range of applications and fuel types.

The broader impacts of this research are to create technology alliances among partners that build innovation capacity from the unique multidisciplinary interaction of experts in fuel cell technology and adjacent fields. The innovation capacity of IUPUI will be increased through the establishment of integral partnerships to obtain AEM-DEFC component materials, fuel sources, marketing strategies, and fuels optimization research expertise. The innovation capacity of the small business partners will be reinforced through applications for their existing intellectual property by: 1) providing a new market for bio-ethanol fuel production (Xylogenics, Inc.); 2) expanding existing market strategies and prototyping and validation processes into fuel cell technologies (Faraday Technology, Inc.); and 3) refining AEMFC technologies by addressing the catalyst challenges in addition to membrane development (Tremont Technology LLC). More broadly, AEM-DEFCs have great potential to replace combustion-powered generators and rechargeable batteries for remote military operations and portable electronic applications, respectively, because of their high efficiency, portability, low-detection (lower heat signature), no battery recharge, and low cost. The timely development of efficient, durable, and cost-effective AEM-DEFCs and corresponding bio-ethanol fuels is imperative to meeting current and future energy demands while reducing operating costs and military vulnerability through locally-source bio-fuels. Commercialized AEM-DEFCs will have local impact by revitalizing industrial and rural economies and global impact by alleviating pressure on non-renewable resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Through the project, a robust process that successfully converted various types of food waste into ethanol fuels to achieve rather high power and energy capacities in alkaline anion-exchange-membrane direct ethanol fuel cells (AAEM-DEFCs) was established and tested. An economic model with mass and energy balances for the fermentation and distillation apparatus was developed and validated with various sizes of reactors and distillation procedures. A conceptual design of the anion-exchange ethanol fuel cell system including the fuel cell stack and balance of plant (BoP) components were initiated by a collaboration of all the team members.  Systematic energy efficiency and cost analysis were performed. 

Intellectual Merit

We demonstrated ethanol production processes to accommodate commercially viable alkaline direct ethanol fuel cells for electricity production from partially distilled alcohol feedstock. Specifically, we investigated a process to use food wastes as substrates for low-grade ethanol production and demonstrated its compatibility with alkaline anion-exchange-membrane direct ethanol fuel cells (AAEM-DEFCs).  As shown in Fig.1, a slurry mixer system was developed to evaluate a diverse source of food waste (also called feedstock or substrate) from Indiana Women?s Prison (Indiana Department of Corrections) and other sources to produce ethanol. The food waste that have been tested for bio-ethanol production included mashed potatoes, beans, mixed beverage leftovers, watermelon, asparagus, vegetarian cheese sandwiches and solids from vegetable juicer.  In addition to these external sources of substrate, dried maize was also used for experimental runs.  A detailed experimental protocol was developed for the processing of various substrates, fermentation with yeast, and distillation to various levels of alcohol by volume (ABV).  Following one or more distillations, the ethanol was produced and delivered for testing in AAEM-DEFCs (Fig.2). The bioethanol samples were found to contain different levels of impurities, such as acetic acid, lactic acid, phosphorus, maltotetraose (Dp4), glucose, maltose, fructose, glycerol, isomaltotriose (Dp3), sulfur and others.  Through a series of design of experiment using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) measurements and AAEM-DEFC testing, the ethanol oxidation activity and stability on the state of the art catalysts with ethanol fuels containing various impurities were investigated in detail and compared to control tests using pure ethanol. Test protocols to evaluate performance and stability of DEFCs were established. A cost model with input data such as substrate costs and electricity tariffs to arrive at a cost-of-ownership analysis was created using MS Excel&reg;.  Mass and energy balances for the fermentation and distillation apparatus was performed and validated with various sizes of reactors and optimized distillation procedures. A 3-D conceptual design of the AAEM-DEFC system including the fuel cell stack and balance of plant (BoP) components were shown in Figure 3. This system enables production of electricity from the food wastes with affordable cost and high efficiency.

(Indianapolis, Indiana); and (3) other partners in the non-profit (Indiana University Research and Technology Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana), government (Indiana Department of Corrections, Indianapolis, Indiana), and small business (Melon Acres, Inc., Oaktown, Indiana) sectors. The broader impacts of this research are to create technology alliances among partners that build innovation capacity from the unique multidisciplinary interaction of experts in ethanol production, fuel cell technology and related fields. The innovation capacity of IUPUI has been enhanced through the establishment of an integral partnership to develop fuel cell component materials, fuel sources, marketing strategies, and fuels optimization research expertise. The innovation capacity of the small business partners was reinforced through applications for their existing intellectual property by: 1) providing a new market for bio-ethanol fuel production; 2) expanding existing market strategies and prototyping and validation processes into fuel cell technologies. More broadly, alkaline direct ethanol fuel cells fueled with the bio-ethanol produced by various food wastes have great potentials to replace combustion-powered generators and rechargeable batteries for a wide range of applications due to their rather high power/energy efficiency, portability, no down-time for recharge, and low cost. The feasibility of efficiently converting a variety of food wastes into biofuels that are suitable for generating electricity with low cost direct ethanol fuel cells was demonstrated.

Developments in the synthesis of diamond over the last three decades have made it possible to grow mono-, poly-, and nano-crystalline diamond on various surfaces. Combining UAB's existing research expertise and intellectual property in the synthesis of CVD diamond with the technological-oriented research to be performed in this project will lead to the development of 1) novel diamond-based sensors for characterizing materials under extreme environments; 2) CVD diamond-coated laser media for improved heat dissipation; and 3) diamond-coated biomedical implants with lifespan extending over thirty years. This project aims to address the difficulties encountered in and ways to improve on the adhesion of CVD diamond films on laser media and biomedical implant materials like stainless steel and cobalt-chrome alloys. The research will also contribute to the knowledge base on the growth mechanisms of diamond single crystals as well as on the growth of nanostructured diamond coatings on metallic and non-metallic substrates.

The broader impacts of this research are enhanced innovative capacities of the academic institution and the industrial partner companies. The research proposed in this project will result in diamond crystals with embedded electrical, magnetic, and stress sensors for applications in extreme conditions of pressures and temperatures. The increase in lifespan of biomedical implants will improve the quality of life for millions of Americans and will reduce the need for revision surgeries. The diamond-coated laser media with minimal loss and high damage threshold will enable new laser applications in industry and medicine. UAB postdoctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from the exposure they will receive by working in close contact with the industry personnel. Also, by partnering with Birmingham Business Alliance (BBA), an economic development organization focused on the economic growth in the seven-county Birmingham region, this project will have a broader impact in the nucleation of new businesses in the innovation depot in the downtown Birmingham area.

This platform provides an innovative solution that consists of a large volume flow rate acoustophoretic phase separator based on ultrasonic standing waves.  Acoustophoresis is a low-power, no-pressure-drop, no-clog, solid-state approach to particle removal from fluid suspensions and is used to achieve separations typically performed with porous filters, but with none of the disadvantages of porous filters.  The acoustic resonator is designed to create a high intensity three-dimensional ultrasonic standing wave resulting in an acoustic radiation force larger than the combined effects of fluid drag and buoyancy and is therefore able to trap and hold stationary, the suspended phase. The novelty is in the ability to create ultrasonic standing wave fields that can trap particles in flow fields with linear velocities in excess of 1 cm.  High frequency (MHz), high-power, and high-efficiency ultrasonic drivers based on solid state switching mode amplifiers will be designed and developed. An embedded control solution using a Digital Signal Processor and microcontroller will be implemented to maintain resonance operation and control power delivery and acoustic trapping force. 

The broader impacts of this research are improved, green, and sustainable separation technology with applications such as environmental oil clean-up, bio-fuels production, and biomedical applications such as blood-lipid separation.  The partners on project team are eager to develop this technology and create green jobs to provide a nascent manufacturing base in Western Massachusetts, a region devastated by a significant decline in its manufacturing base. The project brings together a unique team with proven innovators from several small companies, engineering faculty from across several disciplines, three graduate students, and eleven undergraduate engineering students. Efforts are being undertaken to include underrepresented minorities in the REU and MS programs.
 
Partners at the inception of the project are Western New England College, as the lead institution, with collaborators from the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Departments in the College of Engineering, and three knowledge-enhancing small business partners: FloDesign Sonics Inc. (Wilbraham, Massachusetts), UTX Inc. (Holmes, New York), and FloDesign Inc. (Wilbraham, Massachusetts).

The Acoustic Wave Separation system provides efficient separation for multi-component liquid streams, consisting of a large volume flow rate acoustophoretic phase separator based on ultrasonic standing waves with the benefit of having no consumables, no generated waste, and a low cost of energy. The disruption and competitive advantage is that this technology offers a green and sustainable alternative for separation of secondary phases with applications in produced water such as separation of emulsified oil from water, bio-fuels such as dewatering of yeast and micro-algae, biomedical devices such as separation of lipids from blood, and manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals through mammalian cell clarification.

 Successful scale-up of the platform has been demonstrated achieving flow rates of 600 L/hr for oil emulsion splitting applications and 50 L/hr for mammalian cell clarification.  Novel electronics and control systems were designed and integrated, including power supply, oscillator, Class D amplifier, and inductor tuning with operating frequencies up to 5 MHz.   Several new models have been developed for the calculation of acoustic radiation forces in three-dimensional acoustic standing waves, driven by piezo-electric plates.  Multi-phase computational fluid dynamics modeling has been performed to aid in improved fluidic design of the systems.  This work has led to the publication of sixteen conference proceedings, eight issued patents, and many more published patent applications. 

The broader impacts were numerous.  A total of twenty senior capstone design projects for undergraduate engineering students were sponsored and supervised.  The NSF BIC award directly funded seventeen Research Experiences for Undergraduates.  The award provided for tuition for four graduate students to successfully finish a Master of Science in Engineering degree.  Three new graduate courses in acoustics were developed and taught. 

 One of the knowledge enhancing partners, FloDesign Sonics, has successfully commercialized the acoustic separation platform technology.  The funding of this award has enabled FloDesign Sonics to accelerate the commercial development and provide jobs to twenty five people.  The NSF BIC award was thus instrumental in translating University research into commercial success.

 The impact of the NSF BIC on embedding innovation within the College of Engineering at Western New England University has been profound. Innovation is now a key part of the engineering curricula and all undergraduate students are exposed and participate in several innovation activities throughout their curriculum. 

The NSF BIC has provided opportunities for several underrepresented groups to participate in the activities.   Two female engineering students and several Hispanic students have performed a summer REU at Western New England University and FloDesign Sonics.  One Hispanic student successfully finished his MS thesis sponsored by the NSF BIC.  Through other funding, one of the KEP partners, FloDesign Sonics, has been able to reach out to several community college students in the area and been able to offer summer internship opportunities to them.  

In summary, the NSF BIC grant has been very productive and successful.  It has accelerated the research and development of the acoustic separation platform through interactions of the university researchers and the knowledge enhancing partners.  The interactions have led to the identification of several promising new markets and customers, which in turn have led to a re-evaluation of the platform.  The NSF BIC has affected a wide community of faculty researchers, industry innovators and entrepreneurs, and undergraduate and graduate students.

Traditional microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) processing techniques are very well suited for a variety of applications.  However, they are generally limited to a small set of standard materials, they are used with planar substrates, and they require clean-room environments.  This project seeks to grow the universe of what is possible through the use of direct-write print technologies and a complementary photonic curing process. Direct-write deposition eliminates many of the material restrictions associated with MEMS techniques.  Nano inks consisting of polymers, metals, ceramics, or composites can all be printed.  The photonic curing process then enables one to cure, or fuse, high temperature printed nanomaterials without damaging surrounding low temperature materials such as polymers. The marriage of multi-material, multi-layer nano ink printing with low temperature curing opens the door to new applications using devices consisting of combinations of material types.

The broader impacts of this research will be economic benefits for the knowledge enhancement partners as well as end users of their technologies.  Nano ink formulations optimized for Aerosol Jet printing and photonic curing will be developed.  Aerosol Jet process enhancements aimed at multi-material deposition will enhance the ability to produce novel MEMS-scale devices. An archive of multidisciplinary webinars as well as lab activities that are incorporated into undergraduate courses and K-12 summer camps will be maintained.

The integration of high speed photonic sintering with digital printing technologies opens up enormous potential for the fabrication of multi-functional composite devices with blends of structural, thermal, electrical, optical, chemical, magnetic, or other functionalities. As a specific example, a multi-material drug delivery micropump has been prototyped and is currently undergoing further development. Results of this work have been widely disseminated through dozens of talks, publications, seminars, and workshops.

The technology is based on encapsulating microorganisms in an inexpensive, safe, extended life-time, silica-based hybrid gel. The microbes are stabilized within the gel and continue to biodegrade pesticides for more than four months. In re-engineering the platform technology for enhanced recovery, communities of microorganisms that transform coal to natural gas will be stabilized by silica encapsulation for ease of transport, enhanced stability, and improvement of function. In re-engineering of the platform technology for bioremediation, microbes will be stabilized and rendered highly active to biodegrade organic contaminants within the percentage of water returned via the well from waters generated during the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) method of drilling. 

The broader impacts of this research are on possible future applications to an efficient and safe oil and gas industry. There is a strong link between a robust domestic energy sector and the creation of new jobs. The U.S. has recently become a net exporter of energy, credited largely to advances in shale oil and gas extraction that use hydraulic fracturing. This proposal develops technologies to enhance gas and oil recovery and a platform that can minimize the environmental impacts from a percentage of the water that is returned via the well and then kept in settling ponds. Two of the knowledge enhancement partners (KEPs) will take away technology to develop and scale-up production of silica-encapsulated, biodegrading bacteria that can be used for treating fracking water in settling ponds. Biostabilization imparted by the silica materials is also important for preserving microbial communities that transform coal to natural gas. One of the KEPs will take away this technology to enhance the ability to deliver microorganisms that increase natural gas production throughout the U.S. and potentially in foreign markets. This application is important because the U.S. has enormous coal reserves and enhancing coal to methane conversion will contribute to a clean energy future for our country.

The factors that need to be considered when designing a bioencapsulation system for hydrocarbon biodegradation are the longevity, capacity, and efficiency, which are determined by the mechanical strength, cytocompatibility, and permeability of the matrix.  In these studies, we developed mechanically strong and biologically active silica gels made from a combination of silicon alkoxide and silica nanoparticles. The gels were optimized for the bacteria based on their compressive strength and cytocompatibility.  The relative rate of biodegradation was increased by designing specially made gels.  These results expand the engineering applications of the microorganisms and will enable long-term use in flow-through bioreactors.

This research also contributed fundamental knowledge for using enzymes in whole cells for biocatalysis and biodegradation applications.  Enzyme catalysts display greater rates and specificity compared to conventional industrial catalysts, but purified enzymes are often too fragile and/or expensive for many applications, necessitating creative methods for using whole cell catalysts expressing the enzyme of interest (1). The use of whole bacterial cells and cells encapsulated in solid matrices can protect cytoplasmic enzymes against harsh conditions and greatly lower production costs. However, the cell membrane and the encapsulating matrix can also significantly lower catalytic rates by limiting diffusion of substrate(s) to the enzyme inside the cell and low molecular weight inhibitors may still permeate the cell and inactivate enzymes.

We also contributed 12 peer-reviewed publications to disseminate knowledge to society. Four patents were filed.  Luca Technologies was not able to compete ultimately with cheap methane from hydraulic fracturing. However, 3F LLC has prospered and continued to develop and is licensing key technology from the University of Minnesota.

The immediate goal is to build upon and re-engineer a promising near infrared (NIR)-based seed-screening platform to increase its performance and accuracy and broaden its applications. The envisioned platform is based on two complementary components: a) NIR molecular spectroscopy and chemometrics integrated with automated, nondestructive high-throughput screening of seeds and other plant materials, and b) customized development of application methodologies that screen extant plant populations based on biochemical phenotypes. This project seeks to meet the challenge presented by the success of high-throughput DNA sequencing and analysis of plant genomes, by establishing analogous high-throughput technologies to analyze a plant's biochemical phenotype. This capability will enhance the ability of plant scientists and plant breeders to utilize genomics and develop improved new cultivars needed to accommodate the global population explosion anticipated in the 21st century. The proposed phenotype-screening platform will have a significant impact on food, feed, and bio-energy production systems because, for the first time, plant scientists and breeders will have access to a unique research tool that will routinely assess, at low cost, multiple plant traits simultaneously and non-destructively based upon biochemical phenotypes. 

The broader impacts of this research are societal, economic, and learning related.  At the societal level, plants have a remarkable, multi-faceted impact on economies, jobs, health, fuel, climate change/carbon sequestration, food security, world peace, the environment, and our overall well being.  Better understanding of plant biology, improving existing varieties, and developing new ones are all key research areas where biochemical phenotype screening will produce invaluable data for achieving sustainable and nurturing ecosystems for a rapidly changing planet. At the economic level, these improvements will greatly enhance the versatility of the screening platform, expand the user base, and make lower cost screening accessible to more public and commercial plant scientists and breeders.  At the learning level, the KEP participants will learn from each other. The project will be a vehicle for Iowa State University faculty and students and small businesses to understand how each other's abilities can be integrated to enable technological solutions to real world-challenges.

Five ISU researchers and these six small businesses will collaborate in a Knowledge Enhancing Partnership (KEP). MTEC BioAnalytics will bring NIR seed screening technology expertise to the project while the other companies have expertise in seed and other plant based products. MTEC BioAnalytics will provide key highthroughput screening platform components (e.g., ultra fast fiber optic switch), engineering design, and the others will provide the use of proprietary and unique collections of characterized seeds that express variation in desirable biochemical phenotypes.","Chen, Y., Pan, G., L?bberstedt, T.~Haploid strategies for functional validation of plant genes~Trends in Biochemical Sciences~~2015~~~~0~ ~0~ ~22/03/2017 09:32:09.250000000, Boote, B.W., Freppon, D.J., De La Fuente, G.N., L?bberstedt, T., Nikolau, B.J., Smith, E.A.~Haploid differentiation in maize kernels based on fluorescence imaging~Plant Breeding~~2015~~~~0~ ~0~ ~22/03/2017 09:32:09.226000000, De la Fuente, G., Frei, U.K., L?bberstedt, T.~Accelerating Plant Breeding~Trends in Plant Sciences~18~2014~667~~~0~ ~0~ ~07/07/2020 04:02:50.436000000, Smelser, A., Blanco, M., L?bberstedt, T., Frei, U.K., Gardner, C.~Germplasm Enhancement of Maize: A look into haploid induction of adapted tropical sources~Plant Breeding~~2015~~~~0~ ~0~ ~22/03/2017 09:32:09.263000000, Jones, Roger W.; Reinot, Tonu; Frei, Ursula K.; Tseng, Yichia; Luebberstedt, Thomas; McClelland, John F.~Selection of Haploid Maize Kernels from Hybrid Kernels for Plant Breeding Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and SIMCA Analysis~APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY~66~2012~447-450~~~0~ ~0~ ~07/07/2020 04:02:50.436000000, Smelser, A., Blanco, M. , L?bberstedt, T., Gardner, C., Schechert, A., Vanous, A., de la Fuente, G.~Weighing in on a method to discriminate maize haploid from hybrid seed~Plant Breeding~134~2015~283~~10.1111/pbr.12260~0~ ~0~ ~07/07/2020 04:02:50.436000000, Newell M., Asoro F., Scott M., White P., Beavis W., Jannink J.-L.~Genome-Wide Association Study For Oat (Avena sativa L.)

This Knowledge Enhancing Partnership (KEP) defined the common technology target that would advance plant sciences, plant breeding, and advanced chemical and biochemical characterizations.  Namely, the rapid and non-destructive evaluation of seed populations and identify and select variants in a targeted biochemical phenotype.  The project developed and engineered a seed-screening platform that used NIR molecular spectroscopy and chemometrics, integrated with automated, non-destructive high-throughput screening of seeds.  The project optimized the platform to enable the high-throughput evaluation of seeds independent of seed size; large seeds being exemplified by corn and soybeans, and small seeds being exemplified by canola and camelina (and other members of the mustard family).  The project?s success was threatened by the retirement of Co-PI Dr. John McClelland and the withdrawal of MTEC BioAnalytics (one of our KEP partners) from the project.  Despite this set-back the project fruitfully engaged two additional spectroscopists to fulfil the projects goals.  These included the evaluation of the reproducibility and sensitivity of spectral acquisition and thus improving screening accuracy.  The developed technology is enabling the development of maize double-haploid technology by providing a high-throughput, nondestructive methods for discriminating and identifying the few kernels of the desired germplasm from the many thousands that are non-desirable.  Further development of this technology is through Iowa State University's Doubled Haploid Facility (http://www.plantbreeding.iastate.edu/DHF/DHF.htm).

Efforts in this area included finding the component capabilities that were already available, developing ones that were not and effectively coupling them together. The second area was working directly with industry on the development of parallel simulation workflows for applications of importance to them.

Methods development focused on tools for the effective integration of a broad set of HPC simulation components being developed through DOE, NSF and DoD support for use in the construction of industrial simulation workflows. The first development addressed the in-memory integration methods needed for the direct coupling the simulation automation components with core physics analysis codes of interest to industry. Such in-memory coupling eliminates the bottleneck that is seen on massively parallel computers when the components of a simulation workflow communicate via files. The second effort, carried out in conjunction with the NSF XSEDE program, was the development of a web-based portal to support industry in the execution of simulation workflows on massively parallel computer systems. The simulation automation components, the in-memory integration tools, and XSEDE HPC portal are available for general use by industry, universities and government laboratories.

Working with multiple open source and commercial physics analysis codes developers, efforts were carried out to develop simulation workflows for seven industrial partners. In each case, the development of the simulation workflows involved a direct collaboration with technical people and users at the companies. The applications considered addressed a diverse set of applications including mechanical failure of integrated circuits, fluid structure interactions, pump design, non-Newtonian flow in a manufacturing process, the large scale removal of pollutants, the application of active flow control, and mesoscale materials behavior.

By superimposing a low-frequency/small-amplitude modulation on the cutting tool, Modulation-Assisted Machining produces small, discrete chips, while dramatically reducing friction and energy dissipation in machining. The Modulation-Assisted Machining research platform will expand the range of application of this technology from the current stationary drilling configurations (developed and commercialized via prior NSF support) to a wide range of rotating tool applications in drilling, turning, boring, trepanning, and related processes. Benefits include greater than two-fold increases in production rate, and large reductions in tool wear and machining emissions. Equally important, the platform will provide for development of robust methods for effecting power transfer to rotating tools and machines in the discrete products manufacturing sector.

The broader impacts of this research are higher productivity, improved product quality, greater use of higher performance alloys that cannot be manufactured economically by conventional machining, and major reductions in machining emissions with associated environmental benefits. These are a consequence of enabling the implementation of Modulation-Assisted Machining across high-performance machining applications. The platform will also offer new cost-effective routes for powder materials manufacturing, and improved cutting techniques for orthopedic surgery.

New, innovative machining technologies are needed to sustain product development and production of these high-performance products that improve quality of life. The proposed research focused on diffusing a new technology &ndash; Modulation Assisted Machining (MAM) &ndash; with wide ranging quality and productivity benefits across the spectrum of machining processes. MAM uses a controlled superimposed modulation of low frequency (&lt; 1000 Hz) and small amplitude (&lt; 300 &mu;m) to fundamentally alter the material removal process in metal machining. Important consequences are formation of small (controlled) discrete chips that are easily evacuated from the machining zone, and dramatic reduction in severity of machining conditions and energy dissipation, as demonstrated in preliminary experiments.   The technology had been commercialized for ""stationary"" small hole drilling processes by M4 Sciences LLC, a Purdue-based start-up, based on patents licensed from Purdue University and research supported by the NSF. These stationary systems are machining configurations wherein the MAM system actuating the tool does not rotate, but the component being machined rotates. The commercial system, consisting of the actuating device and controller, is installed as an accessory to machines analogous to a ""computer mouse"", with minimal changes to the machining equipment. The innovative capability of MAM and M4Sciences-Purdue partnership had been recognized by significant product sales in applications ranging from automotive to biomedical (Fig. 2), an R&amp;D 100 Award and a Small Business Administration (SBA) Tibbetts Award.

Building on this prior research and commercialization, the present partnership involving Purdue University, M4 Sciences LLC and various large and small companies has significantly expanded the capability of modulation-assisted machining  technology by enabling applications in rotating drilling systems ( with live tools).  This has been accomplished by  addressing key research challenges pertaining to power transmission to rotating (MAM) actuator devices, characterization of machining performance of the rotating systems, and detailed quantification of benefits of this technology  to product quality, tool wear, and energy dissipation, building on the preliminary findings.The key outcomes are:

a) Using deep hole drilling as the application platform, a prototype system  was constructed and demonstrated with rotating live tools. Machining  performance tests were successfully conducted with the protoype system  in difficult to machine titanium and nickel alloys,  steels, cast irons and soft metals.

b) A modulation maching testbed was established to obtain critical performance data needed by customers in evaluating and making decisions about this new technology for implementation.

c) The machining system demonstrated significantly better performance than conventional drilling/machining in these metals: upto 4 fold increase in material removal rates, 40-70% reduction in  machining energy, 1-2 orders of magnitude reduction in tool wear, ability to drill metal  alloys that could not otherwise be machined in any practical way, and  better component surface qulaity in terms of surface finish and texture.  The system could also effect novel topographical surface textures, many  of which could be of value for improving fucntional performance of  components.

Service life will also be extended, while at the same time reducing environmental impacts.  This project will advance thermal-modification technology toward the development of advanced, high-performing engineered wood products.  Thermally-modified wood is currently used in a limited set of applications, including solid wood flooring, external cladding, and decking products. This project will advance the platform so that it can be the basis of new, high-volume, and in-demand engineered wood products for markets that are poised to grow quickly in the near future when the demand for engineered wood products increases with the rebound in U.S. residential and commercial construction. The completion and validation of research will also facilitate interactions and information exchange between stakeholders within the forest products industry to enhance opportunities for sustained forest products production and use; and it will contribut to improvement in the knowledge, skills, and capacity of the forest products industry workforce and management. 

The broader impacts of this project will be job creation, national export earnings, and better homes and buildings from engineered wood products.  This project will advance the scientific understanding of the thermal-modification platform and propel it toward potential applications for new, ultra-high-performing thermally-modified engineered wood products that excel in severe environmental conditions. Ultimately, such products will bolster the critical U.S. forest products industry by increasing U.S. economic competitiveness, increasing the number of jobs (many of them in rural and lesser-populated areas where  the need is particularly great), increasing revenues for manufacturers, and accelerating the export of new products.

The platform will use Raman spectroscopy to analyze organic compounds in the gas phase or in aqueous solution. A key technical challenge for VOC detection, which this project will address, relates to identifying and distinguishing VOC signatures at low concentrations in complex mixtures. Commercially viable platforms for use in the field or at the point-of-care also must be highly robust, easy-to-use, and cost-effective. This project employs a fundamentally different approach than currently marketed systems. The platform involves a disposable, VOC sample collection/pre-concentration device, which out-performs more elaborate existing devices at lower cost. To enable sensitive VOC detection, the platform uses an innovative Raman probe, which is more sensitive than conventional Raman probes, but circumvents the reproducibility problems encountered with Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy VOCs enriched and detected at the Raman sensor surface in a unique manner which also increases selectivity. The team will refine a preliminary variant of this sensor and will perform initial experiments aimed at understanding key system parameters, while simultaneously developing a second generation sensor probe with increased sensitivity, that is small, robust, and capable of being interfaced with a portable Raman spectrometer.The probe will further be adapted for measuring compounds in the liquid phase, specifically in complex aqueous solutions such as cell culture media. 

Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this research include rapid, near patient, and non-invasive diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia, wound infections, and active tuberculosis that can benefit patients in the U.S. and globally. Bioreactor process monitoring ensures a reliable supply of biopharmaceuticals. Enabling the development and commercialization of a novel platform technology that can address these applications has economic benefits for the small business partners directly involved in this effort, and for potential future business partners in the medical device and biotech industry, thereby enhancing U.S. competitiveness.  

Partners at the inception of the project are the lead academic institution: Keck Graduate Institute (Claremont, CA), and an academic partner, the chemistry department at Pomona College (Claremont, CA). The project involves three small businesses as core Knowledge-Enhancement Partners: Tanner Research, Inc. (Monrovia, CA), Claremont BioSolutions (Upland, CA), and Lambda Solutions Inc (Waltham, MA). Other partners active in the specific targeted applications areas will be involved in the effort, including large companies such as KCI (San Antonio, Texas), leveraging KGI's strong connections with the biotech and medical device industry.",,,"Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath or in the headspace of liquid cultures, biological specimens, or environmental samples is important for a variety of medical and industrial applications. Sensitive and specific VOC analysis typically requires complex and expensive mass spectrometric systems.  Raman spectroscopy enables specific compound identification based on distinct spectral fingerprints but traditionally has low sensitivity. We have developed a novel Raman system that is low-cost, robust, readily manufacturable, and provides VOC detection in the low parts per million (ppm) range. VOCs from the gas phase are absorbed and enriched in a thin polymer film coated on the surface of an optical sensor element. The VOC enriched polymer film is probed with evanescent wave excitation and the Raman scattering collected using optimized optics. To improve the signal to background and resolve VOC mixture spectra, we applied two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis to time series spectra acquired during VOC absorption into the polymer film. The system enabled detection of known VOC biomarkers for selected bacterial pathogens with significantly higher sensitivity than commercial Raman probes, and with good agreement to reference Raman spectra of the pure compounds. Mixture spectra were further de-convoluted in the 2D Raman spectrum and through segmented data analysis. We have developed an algorithm that enables automated compound identification by comparison to a library of reference spectra. To enable off-line collection of VOCs in a format that can be readily integrated into medical or industrial devices, we have developed a small disposable sample collector that absorbs and concentrates VOCs. The sample collector is then transferred into a small chamber attached to the Raman sensor wherein it is heated to desorb the VOCs, which are then re-absorbed on top of the sensor optics. One of the targeted applications for this system is early differential diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa as one of the main causative pathogens. We have worked on identifying patterns of VOCs that can be used to detect P.aeruginosa, and differentiate between asymptomatic colonization of the airway and active infection. This project has provided research opportunities for 12 undergraduate and 5 graduate students. We have further engaged students to investigate the end user needs, competitor technologies, and market potential related to key targeted applications.

It is these modules that serve as the basic building blocks of a vast array of equipment including electrified transportation; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; energy exploration; renewable energy and storage interfaces; and grid-connected power electronics. With approximately 30% of all power produced in the U.S. passing through a power electronic converter or motor drive before it reaches its end use, it is crucial that power electronic systems operate as reliably and efficiently as possible. The U.S. DoE estimates that this percentage will increase to 80% over the next 15 years. Wide bandgap-based power electronics, particularly those made with SiC, have been shown to vastly reduce losses (> 50%); while simultaneously increasing power density, resiliency, and reliability. Even though part cost is higher for SiC devices versus silicon, in many cases, overall system costs are reduced through simpler thermal management due to the higher temperature performance offered by SiC.

The broader impacts of this research include developing leading-edge mixed-signal circuitry for use in power electronic modules that will influence a vast array of products used by millions in the U.S. In addition, there are the economic impacts of stimulating the creation of numerous jobs, differentiation in the marketplace for the core partners, and fostering a customer-supplier relationship through the three partners as the technologies mature. With the anticipated growth described above, the market potential for these technologies is clearly in the billions of dollars. Another impact is on an emerging workforce. This project will educate graduate and undergraduate students in building innovation capacity to be followed by accelerating innovations. It will also help to attract K-12 students to the electronics field as a relatively mature research platform undergoes a transformation.

The University of Arkansas (UA) led a team of researchers from Ozark Integrated Circuits, Arkansas Power Electronics International, and Raytheon Systems Limited to model, design, and test over 40 distinct circuits that operate at temperatures exceeding 400 C. These circuits were originally intended to be placed inside of silicon carbide based power electronic modules for transportation and energy applications. All of these objectives were achieved and have led to the world's first all-SiC power modules. However, further research discoveries have led to even broader impacts in space exploration and diesel engine design that are being commercialized by Ozark IC.
This project not only met the goals of the Building Innovation Capacity Program by cultivating a customer-supplier value chain from university research to IC foundry to IC design company to power module manufacturer, but also individually benefitted each partner in a standalone fashion through improved models, design methods, design tools, and unique discoveries that are being capitalized upon beyond the scope of the original project.
The UA has had the opportunity to involve a substantial number of graduate and undergraduate students (over 25) in this project. These students have had unique experiences and are entering the workforce as highly valued IC design engineers or are heading to graduate schools to continue their education being better prepared than most students because of this experience.
The business relationships among the team members are strong and collaborations continue on other projects. Each entity has viewed this project as an excellent stepping stone to further research, product development, and business opportunities.

In addition, FIU created a resource-rich infrastructure and industry accepted processes for hands on development and testing of real-world applications.  With industry partners, FIU developed strategies and business approaches that promote productization and capital infusion.

The project met or exceeded all benchmarks including commercialization analysis and recommendation, number of partners and 3rd party investors, number of pipelined research projects, number of entrepreneurial focused seminars, number of students actively working on ecosystem-related projects, number of mentor-mentee relationships, number of projects presented to angel investors, number of startup companies spawned, and number of publications.  The project also exceeded its goals related to involving under-represented groups and internships.

The AIR Ecosystem (http://cake.fiu.edu/AIR) facilitated technology transfer from two NSF centers at FIU, both directed by the Ecosystem?s PI Dr. Naphtali Rishe: Center for Innovative Information Systems Engineering (http://crest.fiu.edu) and Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Knowledge Enablement at Florida International and Atlantic Universities (I/UCRC-CAKE, http://cake.fiu.edu)

A major project of the Ecosystem was the TerraFly Platform for ALTA sub-centimeter aerial photography: http://Teralta.com  

ALTA is an Autonomous Lighter Than Air imaging/sensing platform that is powered by natural forces and information instead of machines.  The ALTA remote sensing system is comprised of a large number of small, tethered or drifting balloons that carry miniature image capture sensors along with GPS location and transmission instruments. The system operates below cloud ceilings, transmitting tree-top, oblique, geo-referenced images at low angles, from low altitudes, and at low cost, making massive balloon deployment feasible.

The availability of aerial imagery at an order of magnitude sharper resolution than current technology, mashed up with thousands of TerraFly datasets will transform environmental and urban sciences and disaster mitigation.

TerraFly (http://terrafly.com)  is a technology and tools for fusion, visualization and querying of geospatial data. The visualization component of the system provides users with the experience of virtual ""flight"" over maps comprised of aerial and satellite imagery overlaid with geo-referenced data. The data drilling and querying component of the system allows the users to easily explore geospatial data, to create geospatial queries, and get instant answers supported by high-performance multidimensional search mechanisms. TerraFly's server farm ingests, geo-locates, cleanses, mosaics, cross-references, and fuses 50TB of basemap data and user-specific data streams.  TerraFly's Application Programming Interface allows rapid deployment of interactive Web applications and has been used to produce systems for disaster mitigation, ecology, real estate, tourism, and municipalities.  TerraFly's  Web-based client interface is accessible via any standard Web browser, with no client software to install.

TerraFly tools include user-friendly geospatial querying, data drill-down, interfaces with real-time data suppliers, demographic analysis, annotation, route dissemination via autopilots, customizable applications, production of aerial atlases, and an application programming interface (API) for production of Web-based map applications.

LC - polymer interfaces have been of vital importance in the liquid crystal display (LCD) industry since its inception.  The recent advent of flexible LCDs using plastic substrates is generating renewed and urgent interest in interface design and associated behavior.  The move from glass to soft flexible substrates not only raises new technical problems, but also illuminates old ones.  These problems and questions of basic science are exceptionally close and are inextricably linked; the goal of the project is to connect device and manufacturing issues in industry to the frontiers of academic research.  The project aims to identify the technical issues in real products of the partner companies and to offer solutions based on the state-of-the-art characterization, computational materials science, and novel materials development. The proposed platform will not only solve key problems in currently emerging technologies, but it will also enable new LC-on-plastic (LCOP) technologies and thereby provide to U.S. industry new opportunities with the potential for strong economic development based on LCOP products.  

The broader impacts of this research are potentially large-scale economic opportunities for U.S. display and related industries.  A dramatic technological change today is the move of LCDs from glass to plastic substrates. This change represents a tremendous opportunity for U.S. industry to again establish a leadership position and develop and benefit from the emerging LCOP technology. The partnership will disseminate project results through networks in the LC-polymer community and provide a model for future industry-university collaboration in practical problem solving.  If the current challenges are overcome, the U.S. will have the opportunity to harness, develop, and cultivate this emerging new technology, with vast technological and economic promise.  

Partners at the inception of the project include the Knowledge-Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of Kent State University (Liquid Crystal Institute) and two small businesses:  AlphaMicron (AMI) (Kent, OH), and Kent Displays (KDI) (Kent, OH), both of which are the pioneers responsible for the breakthrough demonstrations that LCOP technology is possible. In addition, there are other partners.

Both compnies produce fundamentally new liquid crystal devices, which use polymers, rather than the conventional glass materials. The collaboration focused on overcoming optical device performance problems associated with the liquid crystal &ndash; polymer interface.

Boogie Board eWriters from Kent Displays, now in global consumer markets for over 5 years, are based on the Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Display technology.  The eWriters are made with flexible eWriter films using a liquid crystal-polymer dispersion.  As such, the technology heavily relies on LC-polymer interfaces at a variety of levels to achieve the optical, mechanical, and eletrical performance needed for various applications.  Most common uses are in quick jotting of notes, drawings, hand written notes, memos, games, etc.  This project was highly successful in research efforts towards these interfaces allowing greater understaing of such systems resulting in dramatic improvements in performance metrics &ndash; line width, brightness, contrast, reliability, irridescence, and more.  Without the fundamental understanding gained from this program, it would not have been possible to make these large improvementsin such a short time.  Examples of the improvements include creating ultra high brightness and contrast perormance eWriters suitable for large area eBoard applications for white board and smart board replacement.  This is a significant commercial thrust of the company and therefore the technological achievements from this project have direct implications in the commercialization activities.  The understnding from this program will also be used in other projects and therefore there will be further leveraging of this work.

AlphaMicon?s guest-host liquid crystal systems are part of a new class of liquid crystal technologies that can provide solution for a number of light management applications ranging from eyewear to smart windows. The alignment layer and driving electronics used for these systems are significantly different that the conventional liquid crystals used in displays. As such, the dynamics of the liquid crystal and its interaction with the alignment layer during electronic switching is not well understood or optimized. During this program, AlphaMicron studied these systems and focused on one particular phenomenon that has hindered the use of this class for large area consumer applications, namely formation of period patterns during switching.  Through study of the dielectric response of its e-Tint configuration, AlphaMicron discovered that the electrical impedance of the device can result in long range undulations in the director orientation. These undulations, in turn, lead to variations in the optical performance across the cells. The system was analyzed using LCR meter coupled with polarized microscopy. It was determined that the undulations can be reduced by controlling the impedance mismatch between the source and device.  Furthermore, treatment of the surface prior to filling helped eliminate the local changes in the director orientation during the switching process and led to elimination of the undesired period pattern that was observed in the cell. The results helped AlphaMicron overcome one of the biggest obstacles in commercializing its e-Tint product in large area markets. As a result of this accomplishment, AlphaMicron has enaged with several large window manufacturers which are interested in using the technology for smart window applications.

This collaboration under the NSF Partnership for Innovation Program resulted not only in fundamental scientific insights in soft matter chemistry and physics, but overcoming problems which allowed improved performance and new applications in liquid crystal device technology.

To do so is critical in order to motivate consumers to renounce current petro-derived materials for new-to-the-world bioplastics such as those proposed herein.  The strategy pursued by the project team is to utilize bioplastics with the right combination of properties while focusing on engineering the interface or boundaries between these components to optimize material performance.   Specifically, selected material components include cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs), poly (omega-hydroxyfatty acids (P (omega-OHFAs)), and poly (lactic acid) (PLA). While P (omeg-OHFAs) provides good hydrolytic stability and physical toughness, the PLA-CNW nanocomposites provide high modulus and improved use temperatures. The knowledge-enhance partner (KEP) small businesses in this project, PolyNew Inc. (engineered CNWs) and SyntheZyme LLC (P(omega-OHFAs) and their blends with PLA), bring together the required technologies to exploit synergies that will result by the judicious combination of materials to provide superior performance 100% biobased bioplastics.  The production of omega-OHFAs will be performed by using SyntheZyme's newly engineered yeast strain that provides the first efficient biotechnological route to convert fatty acids to omega-HOFAs.  P(omega-HOFAs) have properties similar to medium density polyethylene (PE). However, unlike PE, P(omega-HOFAs) contain ester groups separated by 13 to 17 methylene (CH2) units. Thus, P(omega-HOFAs) provide important PE-like properties such as water resistance and excellent ductility while retaining chemical reactivity so they can be reactive blended with PLA and strengthened by CNWs. PolyNew Inc. and SyntheZyme LLC will work together to develop technologies by which CNWs are functionalized to engineer interactions with blended P(omega-HOFAs) and PLAs. The impressive performance of CNWs derives from their aspect ratio that enables them to reach their percolation threshold (e.g., where long-range connectivity is achieved within the material) at relatively low loadings, resulting in impressive modulus increases. Preliminary work has shown that P (omega-OHFAs)/PLA blends show promising properties that would greatly benefit by incorporation of specifically functionalized CNWs. 

The broader impacts of this research to society at large are many. The project is consistent with Federal policies supporting greater use of biobased products including the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, which is designed to ensure that a sufficiently large base of new, non-food, non-feed biomass crops is established to meet demands for renewable energy and bioproducts. Socially, there are advantages associated with employment in the plastics, forestry and agriculture sectors of the economy--the project strongly supports Green Jobs creation. Reductions in petroleum dependence (even relatively modest ones) are also considered beneficial. Teaching and training will be promoted and considerable outreach activities will be pursued. Previous success in incorporating underrepresented groups (women, Hispanics, and African Americans) in research activities will be continued.

Partners at the inception of the project are the Knowledge-Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of NYU-POLY (Brooklyn, NY) and two small businesses partner companies: SyntheZyme LLC (Brooklyn, NY), a small business with private stock holders; and PolyNew Inc.

The particular emphasis of this project is to broaden the participation of underrepresented entrepreneurs and scientists in federal innovation research and development programs, specifically the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Partnership for Innovation (PIF) programs. These programs provide funding for scientists and entrepreneurs to develop advanced innovations that have a high level of uncertainty and risk of not resulting in a desired prototype or technological discovery. This project will match underrepresented minorities with resources and individuals that have business and scientific expertise to 1) provide coaching and entrepreneurship training 2) advance the development of ideas for STEM innovations and 3) understand and prepare innovators for the product development stage prior to applying for SBIR or PFI. The project is being disseminated through Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT), a national nonprofit that has provided career coaching and professional development training to over 5,000 African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American program participants over 15 years to diversify the talent pipelines of more than 100 corporations and social sector organizations. 

The proposed project will address barriers of entrepreneurs and scientists from underrepresented backgrounds by providing coaching and pathways to funding for commercializing innovative scientific and technical ideas. Today less than 1% of venture capital-backed entrepreneurs are underrepresented minorities, and ventures with all-Black founding teams received 30-60% of the funding amount acquired by all-White and all Asian venture capital-backed teams. Lack of access to capital and networks have been documented as limiting factors for entrepreneurs, with these factors magnified for entrepreneurs from underrepresented backgrounds. The AWARE EDP program provides opportunities to educate scientists and entrepreneurs through mentorship and coaching on how to develop proof of concepts, test the strength and viability of ideas through informational interviews, understand strategies for success in the tech industry through boot camps with tech partners, and create an action plan for acquiring seed funding. The four goals of this program are the following: 1) provide an entrepreneurship training playbook and coaching to help underrepresented entrepreneurs and scientists create technical innovations; 2) provide participants with mentorship and coaching to develop scientific and technology-based products and services; 3) support SBIR/PFI grant applications and awards of program participants through workshops with program officers and guidance in the application process; and 4) provide access to resources for focus groups, prototype testing, capital introduction and other support services for entrepreneurs.

The piezoelectric effect is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to an applied mechanical stress.  Piezoelectric ceramics are important because they play critical role in daily use devices including automobiles, aircrafts, medical instruments, food processing, and house-hold electronics. This project will result in scale-up of the manufacturing process of a particular type of piezoelectric ceramic: textured piezoelectric ceramics. Textured ceramics have the following unique features: three-to-five times higher transduction coefficients, thermal stability over high temperatures, and mechanical robustness as compared to randomly oriented polycrystalline ceramics.?These features provide the following advantages: higher efficiency, resolution, cost savings, miniaturization, and power density. Textured ceramics can be synthesized using the same process as that established for random ceramics and thus do not require any new tooling or equipment.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The sintering stages in achieving textured ceramics will be analyzed to identify the challenges associated with scaling the manufacturing process to ensure consistent production. This includes establishing the process for synthesizing the seeds in large quantities with adequate morphology and dimension, and tailoring the binder-burnout and sintering profiles. The effect of processing variables that play a deterministic role in achieving the large grain brick-wall like microstructure will be evaluated. Matrix/seed template interfaces in the microstructure will be investigated using high resolution microscopy to understand the nature of domain wall motion with applied electric field. This, in turn, will provide assessment of the processes controlling the mechanical and electrical aging behavior. In conjunction with the time-temperature dependent sintering studies, the field-stress dependent domain migration studies will provide a full understanding of the electromechanical behavior of the textured ceramics. 

In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate and graduate students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through Virginia Tech's Catalyst program, KnowledgeWorks entrepreneurship events, participation in the Nexus Conference, and participation in the iScholars program.

The project engages?Harris Corporation, Prime Photonics, and the Virginia Tech Intellectual Property Office to augment the team's research capability, provide access to industrial testing and manufacturing environment, and guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.",,,"Piezoelectric materials provide two-way efficient conversion of mechanical to electrical energy or vice-versa. Owing to this unique ability, piezoelectric components are relevant in our daily lives and are part of commonly used electromechanical systems and appliances such as automobiles, medical imaging, house-hold appliances, cellular communication, musical instruments, motors, machining and drilling, energy harvesting, etc. In applications where high voltages are applied on the piezoelectric materials, such as ultrasonic cleaners, non-destructive testing, machining tools, underwater communication and motors, understanding the changes in magnitude of electromechanical properties under high electric fields and high temperatures becomes extremely important. Ideally, these changes should be small and electromechanical properties should maintain their starting values over the entire operating regime. This was the overarching goal of this program to develop piezoelectric materials with outstanding electromechanical properties and high stability under increasing electric field and temperature. Piezoelectric ceramic materials are generally synthesized with random microstructure, implying that grains in the ceramic have different crystallographic orientation. This averages out the overall electromechanical response. However, if the piezoelectric ceramics can be synthesized with prescribed crystallographic orientation, then the electromechanical response will be maximized. Piezoelectric materials with perovskite crystal structure have specific crystallographic direction along which the electromechanical response is maximum. Our team has implemented processing method that results in ceramics with specific grain orientation, called as textured ceramics. This processing method is termed as templated grain growth, where template seeds are utilized to drive the epitaxial grain growth. Textured ceramics have two-to-five times higher transduction coefficients as compared to randomly oriented polycrystalline ceramics, providing the advantages of higher efficiency, power density, cost savings, and miniaturization. Additional goals of this project were to: (i) scale-up the manufacturing process of textured piezoelectric ceramics, (ii) address the technology gaps in understanding the role of grain size and shapes towards controlling the magnitude of electromechanical coefficients in textured ceramics and (iii) provide manufacturing innovation and entrepreneurship experiences to the personnel involved in this project. Experimental results from the program demonstrated methodology to synthesize large quantities of template seeds with consistent dimensions and properties. Using these seeds, scalable manufacturing of textured piezoelectric ceramics was demonstrated. Piezoelectric compositions with high magnitude of electromechanical response were designed and evaluated for scalable manufacturing, high temperature and field stability, and mechanical strength. In-situ diffraction and electron microscopy were utilized to develop fundamental understanding of defect and domain engineering, and electric-field induced phase transformations.
            During this program, a ceramic manufacturing facility for conducting scaling experiments was developed at Innovation Park, Penn State University. This is a unique facility which allows university laboratory-based compositions and processing methods to be tested in manufacturing environment for scalable production and repeatability. The Innovation Park at Penn State houses several university-based start-up?s and small businesses, and it is expected that this manufacturing facility will provide them important resource for process and material development. A piezoelectric ceramic manufacturing-oriented industry workshop is being planned to be organized in Fall 2020 at this manufacturing facility. Several industrial outreach activities were conducted during program ranging from seminars to laboratory visits and tours to organizing industry-oriented workshops and conferences. Knowledge gained from the program was shared with industry and government laboratory. An early-career female research scientist was trained during the program on synthesis, characterization and modeling of piezoelectric materials. In collaboration with The American Ceramic Society, an international conference was organized in September 2019 in Falls Church, VA, which was attended by over 100 scientists working in the area of energy conversion. An online high school summer camp is being planned for summer 2020 to expose the students to smart materials at an early age.

Current and future health-care personnel, along with family caregivers, will be unable to treat or even monitor the wide-ranging challenges of the aging population from anxiety to loneliness, from dementia to physical disability.  This project develops Affordable Robotic Intelligence for Elderly Support (ARIES) as one element in meeting these challenges.  Technology will not, and should not, replace trained health-care professionals or close members of the family; but technology can lighten the burden on family members and the healthcare system.  ARIES will provide affordable assistance with small but challenging tasks of daily living, such as finding keys or reading glasses; remembering medication or appointments; connecting with friends and family; and relieving agitation and loneliness.  To be effective in these tasks, ARIES must be easily understandable and reliable, and the research team is developing innovative technological solutions to meet these goals. The most significant outcome of ARIES will be to facilitate and improve health care for older populations and enable more people to continue fulfilling lives in their own homes. 

The project team harnesses novel research insights from the cognitive and behavioral sciences, geriatric psychiatry, computer science, and industrial design, as well as industry partner Hasbro's expertise in effective, affordable engineering.  The researchers will (a) use behavioral science methods to assess older adults' major challenges of daily living with which a small, affordable robotic system can assist; (b) apply inclusive design principles and cutting-edge computer science to develop a small animal-like robot that can alleviate these challenges; and (c) provide a systematic assessment of the developed system?s safety, efficacy, and acceptability in test beds with healthy adults as well as older people with cognitive impairments.  From a computer science perspective, this project will expand the frontiers of end-user programming and allow user and robot to engage in mutual teaching and learning.  The project is also poised to lead to engineering advances in object tracking and location technology and in the expansion of robot skills by levering smartphone capabilities. From a psychological perspective, the project will provide novel insights into human-robot interaction (especially when the user has no technical expertise) as well as advances in the optimal design of function and appearance in robotic technology for human benefits.","Malle, Bertram F. and Bello, Paul and Scheutz, Matthias~Requirements for an Artificial Agent with Norm Competence~AIES '19: Proceedings of the 2019 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society~~2019~~~10.1145/3306618.3314252~10170790~21 to 27~10170790~OSTI~13/07/2020 05:15:30.153000000, Ullman, Daniel and Malle, Bertram F.~Measuring Gains and Losses in Human-Robot Trust: Evidence for Differentiable Components of Trust~2019 14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)~~2019~~~10.1109/HRI.2019.8673154~10170792~618 to 619~10170792~OSTI~13/07/2020 05:15:30.3000000",,,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND

The industrial control system security techniques are important because the compromise of these ICS networks can lead to loss of life, widespread blackouts, environmental disasters, and financial loss.  

The project will result in a prototype of an ICS security and monitoring system. This ICS security and monitoring system has the following unique features: 1) the ability to detect malicious network traffic, the ability to detect malicious programs running on embedded controllers, and 3) the ability to backup programs transmitted over the network.  These features provide the following advantages: 1) defense against Nation State level attackers, 2) minimally-invasive techniques to detect malware on embedded controllers, and 3) passive program backups when compared to the leading competing approaches such as standard intrusion detection systems and hardware add-ons in this market space. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: intrusion detection, access control, network management, and malware detection for industrial control systems. Specifically, this project presents new ICS specific fingerprinting techniques that can be used to supplement traditional techniques for intrusion detection, access control, or network management. Further, a robust technique for detecting code modification of programmable logic controllers (which was done by Stuxnet), using standard programmable logic controller (PLC) diagnostic information will be developed.

Understanding what devices are accessing these networks, if malware is on critical industrial control system (ICS) components, and ways to quickly restore critical software when an attack occurs are fundamental to securing these networks. ICSs have several constraints that make securing them very challenging. For example, in ICS networks it is too often infeasible to upgrade legacy equipment to provide standard cryptographic primitives due to lack of computing power and software capabilities. Also, some ICS networks (e.g., the power grid) have components that are physically located in remote areas, often with very little physical security. Additionally, for many ICSs it is critical that they be online at all times, which eliminates any security approach (that is new or ported from the traditional IT domain) that can compromise their uptime. This necessitates novel but practical techniques that can serve as an overlay on existing ICS networks to improve their security.

In this project we realized novel techniques to enhance the security and manageability of ICSs. Various security and management techniques specifically designed for ICS networks moved from proof-of-concept stage to deployed prototypes at multiple utilities. Further, continuous customer discovery took place as well as the development of a go-to-market strategy.

Polymer-grafted lignin surfactants are important because pesticide formulations often contain large amounts of added synthetic polymers and surfactants, which stabilize the formulation and increase the pesticide activity. However, these are generally derived from petroleum and can have negative impacts on pollinators as well as soil and water ecology. This project will result in a plant-derived dispersant with improved sustainability and biocompatibility that can replace multiple components of commercial pesticide formulations. This polymer-grafted lignin has the following unique features: it is a highly effective dispersant, it can improve pesticide penetration through plant surfaces, and it is biocompatible and biodegradable. These features allow it to replace multiple components of commercial pesticide formulations, resulting in cost savings, increased loading of active ingredients, and reduced environmental toxicity.

This project addresses the following technology gap as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Multi-functional dispersants derived from biomass could improve the sustainability of agrochemicals, both in reducing dependence on petroleum feedstocks but also reducing the ecological impact of complex pesticide formulations. Polymer-grafted lignin both stabilizes suspensions but also enhances penetration through plant cuticles, and the challenge that is to be addressed during the project is leveraging these activities in test formulations of commercial pesticides that will be evaluated in controlled studies on a diversity of weeds. In addition, the doctoral student involved in this project will receive technology translation experiences through leading the development of these formulations and comparing them to those based on leading commercial dispersants.

Grafting poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), a  biocompatible and water-soluble polymer, onto kraft lignin has been  shown to augment its function as a surfactant, resulting in significant  reductions in surface tension as well as the cyclohexane-water  interfacial tension. In this AIR-TT project, KLPEG was evaluated as a  dispersant in model formulations of commercial herbicides and compared  to a leading commercial dispersant based on naphthalene sulfonate. It  was found that KLPEG imparted comparable effects on the stability of  emulsion concentrates and water-dispersable granules. Fundamental  colloidal studies demonstrated an important dependence on the dispersant  zeta potenital and synergistic effects with the nonionic surfactants  used in these formulations. Preliminary greenhouse studies at Purdue  University demonstrate that these formulations also have comparable  efficacy, suggesting that KLPEG could be an important new dispersant in  agrochemical products, providing a unique combination of performance and  biocompatibility as well as offering a large-scale industrial  application for kraft lignin. Researchers at Purdue University are  currently in discussions with Syngenta on expanded greenhouse and field  studies of novel formulations of Syngenta products that incorporate  KLPEG dispersants.

This is especially demanding in the particular design with a piezoelectric actuator since it limits the achievable closed contact force to levels much lower than its conventional, spring-loaded actuators. b) The development of electrical conductors that conduct heat efficiently from the contacts in the vacuum chamber to the terminals of the disconnect switch so that it can be safely dissipated without overheating the contacts or the actuator inside the vacuum chamber.?In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate and graduate students, will receive technology translation experiences through the development of a minimum viable product and the customer discovery process.

This 15 kV-class switch can carry continuous currents of up to 500 A and opens within 1 ms, which is at least ten times faster than today's circuit breakers. Such a fast interruption could effectively limit the fault current and thus avoid or minimize physical damage to susceptible power equipment.  

 

The fast mechanical switch uses a piezoelectric actuator integrated inside a vacuum switching chamber. Two ceramic bushings act as the power terminals on top of the grounded chamber. The actuator is controlled from signals outside the chamber though a multi-pin vacuum feedthrough. The actuator has an elliptical shell that amplifies the mechanical response of the piezoelectric stack. The elliptical shell is housed in a vacuum-compatible polymeric frame to which the outer conductors and moving contact tabs are attached. The switch (bottom of figure at left) uses contacts of optimized geometry and material to maximize voltage withstand capabilities when the switch is in the open position and to minimize losses during current conduction. Arc quenching capabilities are not required because the hybrid topology guarantees contact opening at zero current.

The fast mechanical switch is equipped with two key features to achieve an improved current conduction capability: (1) An optimized material and geometry of the contacts of the switch, and (2) thermosyphons, integrated in the conductors of the two bushings. For the first feature, a systematic procedure for selections of contact materials based on mechanical and electrical stresses experienced by FMS has been developed. From this, it was determined that having a contact pair made of dissimilar materials leads to better thermal performance and lower wear. A provisional patent has been filed regarding the dissimilar contact materials. For the second feature, a type of thermosyphon bushing has been designed, manufactured and tested to confirm its substantially improved thermal conductivity inside the vacuum chamber of the fast mechanical switch. The equivalent thermal conductivity of the thermosyphon bushing was demonstrated to reach 3,600 W/m/K when transferring 100 W heat load, an improvement of more than a factor of nine over the intrinsic thermal conductivity of pure copper.

 

The fast mechanical switch can work as a stand-alone disconnect switch in traditional AC applications. But more likely, it could become the centerpiece of a hybrid circuit breaker (Figure 2), which could limit fault currents in densely populated areas. In the future, similar topologies could be used to develop DC circuit breakers, which would enable multi-port DC systems for highly energy-efficient and power dense transmission and distribution systems as they are needed for microgrids, large-scale interconnection of renewable energy resources, electric ships, and electric aircraft. Electric utilities in the United States are often reluctant with to integrate distributed renewable energy resources such as solar, wind or small hydro-electric power. One reason is that the rapid rise of fault currents in the case of short circuits are not easily managed by conventional switchgear. For the purpose of solving this problem, our fast mechanical switch has been developed to limit the fault current and secure the resilience of power grids, so that more renewable energy resources can be more seamlessly integrated into power systems.

Hypertension during pregnancy can result in high maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. This mobile-phone based system is important because if hypertension is detected early, mothers and babies have a greatly increased survival rate compared to what happens if this condition is detected at a later stage. The project is expected to result in a prototype of a low cost mHealth technology that can be used at point-of-care or at home. In the future, mHealth will transform the way diseases are diagnosed and treated, drive the healthcare revolution, and have the potential to significantly extend life expectancy. 

However, there are several fundamental challenges facing mHealth systems that need to be addressed in this project through innovative scientific contributions. The proposed technology is expected to transform mobile healthcare through creation of mobile-platform independent, intelligent mobile sensing systems. A traditional approach requires efforts of several trained professionals to perform, process, and analyze the medical tests, and a qualified doctor to make the diagnosis and treatment decisions.  The common basis for this decision-making process is the professional experience of a single/several doctor(s). Because of recent advancements in mHealth technologies and Big Data management, it is now possible to access large-scale biomedical data about thousands of different patients and doctors efficiently.  This can be used to create an mHealth mobile-phone application to support and enhance the clinical decision making process. This approach can revolutionize patient diagnostics and treatment, decrease human error, and enable a variety of new biomedical instruments. However, it requires creation of a cross platform system compatible with different mobile hardware and software platforms. This work will address this challenge on multiple levels (ranging from hardware performance fluctuations within the same mobile device and platform, to cross-platform compatibility - e.g. Android and Apple iOS mobile operating systems). The project is expected to close important knowledge gaps about future mHealth systems and develop a fully functional prototype, compatible with different mobile hardware systems.

The general, bigger goal was to address different fundamental challenges preventing wide spread of mHealth and make steps towards versatile point-of-care testing. In addition to that we were working on health-related data management and created new algorithms and data structures for easier search, processing and analysis. This helped to simplify access to the biomedical data and made them more usable for diagnostics and early detection of complications.

While working on this project we have developed several prototypes for mobile phone-based biomedical testing called Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) compatible with many commercial ELISA reagents. Currently ELISA is one of the most sensitive approaches to measurements of proteins, hormones and antibodies present even at very low concentrations. There are several biomarkers that can serve as early indicators of preeclampsia. They include placental growth factor (PlGF) and antiangiogenic factor soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1). Both of them can be measured using traditional ELISA. Therefore, our mobile ELISA technology is a step towards enabling these important measurements in doctors? offices. Furthermore, to demonstrate practicality and usefulness of our system we showed that it can accurately measure progesterone, a hormone that is especially important in early pregnancy. We demonstrated that our mobile system can conduct the measurements with gold standard accuracy.

In addition to that we purchased electronic health records from Preeclampsia Foundation and used them for analysis of additional symptoms and biomarkers indicating future development of preeclampsia. This was a challenging task because of the data formats that were used for sharing these data, amount of information in each anonymized record and very different structure representations in numerous biomedical tests. We had to design and implement many innovative algorithms allowing us to extract, integrate and analyze the data. These allowed us to visualize how the disease was progressing is different patients and much easier track and compare anomalies appearing in the test results. The developed algorithms were very general and were later successfully demonstrated on other domains. As a result, we developed several advanced data integration, search algorithms, data structures, machine learning pipelines and tools that can benefit healthcare, financial analytics and general data management.

In addition to that, one PhD student graduated based on the work conducted for this project and found an Optical Engineer position in a healthcare-related company. A Master student and multiple undergraduate students that were involved in mini-projects related to this technology graduated and found good engineering positions.

The results of the project were broadly disseminated. They were presented in multiple conference and published in journal publications. In addition to that demonstration of the prototype was conducted at the US Congress, and the National Academy of Sciences.

The piezoelectric effect is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to an applied mechanical stress.  Piezoelectric ceramics are important because they play critical role in daily use devices including automobiles, aircrafts, medical instruments, food processing, and house-hold electronics. This project will result in scale-up of the manufacturing process of a particular type of piezoelectric ceramic: textured piezoelectric ceramics. Textured ceramics have the following unique features: three-to-five times higher transduction coefficients, thermal stability over high temperatures, and mechanical robustness as compared to randomly oriented polycrystalline ceramics.?These features provide the following advantages: higher efficiency, resolution, cost savings, miniaturization, and power density. Textured ceramics can be synthesized using the same process as that established for random ceramics and thus do not require any new tooling or equipment.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The sintering stages in achieving textured ceramics will be analyzed to identify the challenges associated with scaling the manufacturing process to ensure consistent production. This includes establishing the process for synthesizing the seeds in large quantities with adequate morphology and dimension, and tailoring the binder-burnout and sintering profiles. The effect of processing variables that play a deterministic role in achieving the large grain brick-wall like microstructure will be evaluated. Matrix/seed template interfaces in the microstructure will be investigated using high resolution microscopy to understand the nature of domain wall motion with applied electric field. This, in turn, will provide assessment of the processes controlling the mechanical and electrical aging behavior. In conjunction with the time-temperature dependent sintering studies, the field-stress dependent domain migration studies will provide a full understanding of the electromechanical behavior of the textured ceramics. 

In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate and graduate students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through Virginia Tech's Catalyst program, KnowledgeWorks entrepreneurship events, participation in the Nexus Conference, and participation in the iScholars program.

It is the most recent imaging modality being employed by pathology departments worldwide and continues to gain traction for diagnostic, educational, and research purposes.

The proposed innovation is important because it can address the challenges of high-throughput microscopy imaging and lower the cost barrier of brightfield and fluorescence whole slide imaging for the biological research and medical diagnostic markets. The project will result in a WSI product prototype that has the following unique features: 1) it can rapidly and precisely detect the sample position over a long axial range without mechanical z-scanning, 2) it is able to handle transparent and low-contrast samples, 3) it can provide multiple imaging modalities in the same platform, and 4) it requires minimum hardware modification to an existing microscope platform. These features lead to a better imaging quality, a higher throughput performance, and a cost saving when compared to the competing WSI products in this market space. ?

The new architecture offers the promise of faster, more energy efficient calculations than current solutions. This is important because there is a large body of applications such as deep-learning, big-data analytics, and data science that all require significant processing capability. While capability requirements continue to increase to meet the needs of these new applications, the rate of improvement of power efficiency of the microprocessors is decreasing (in other words, the trends predicted by Moore's Law are beginning to slow).  

This project will result in a prototype chip-design of the MPU with complete software API (Application Programming Interface) for end-to-end application demonstrations based on real-time speech recognition and big-data analytics for Internet search capabilities. The MPU includes the following unique features:  an energy-efficient simple core implementation (including exploration of mechanisms for pipeline organization, virtual-memory, and coherence), an implementation that connects 128 such cores together, cores connected through 3D links to memory, and end-to-end software implementation. Compared to state-of-art server chips in the market, the MPU architecture provides two-fold to 12-fold calculation speedup while reducing energy consumption by 10-fold.  

This project addresses the following two technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: a) the difficulty of developing end-to end software on this new highly concurrent architecture and the determination of the mechanisms required, and b) Extensive exploration of various application domains (initially demonstrating speech recognition and internet search capabilities) to determine quantitatively the benefits of this architecture over the state-of-the-art.

Our key innovation, is the discovery that three fundamental principles can be used to develop a processor that can be programmed and can run multiple application classes efficiently. The principles are: i) generality through massive concurrency, ii) extreme energy savings through low-energy computation by building a processor with a very-short pipeline, no speculation, and almost no caches, iii) generality through a flexible programming model.

Major goals of the project:

HW Engineering: This project?s focus is to develop a prototype (chip-design, complete software
 API, and end-to-end application demos) based on the research ideas developed and demonstrated. We will develop an FPGA-prototype chip

SW Engineering: End-to-end software implementation of real-time speech recognition and Internet search. The applications will run on a software simulation and the FPGA prototype. The project will provide end-to-end demos for both applications, and develop infrastructure that will allow implementation of applications for future partners and/or licensing.

Outcomes:

We completed a specification and RTL implementation of a chip design based on the RISC-V processor. The design has also been mapped to a small FPGA and executes full programs.

We have completed a full system simulator, extending the API for programming the chip, and improving its compiler to allow mapping of programs to the chip very quickly. We also completed mapping three large applications: Kaldi a speech recognition engine, bwa-mem a genomics application, and several graph processing programs. We also developed optimizations to software schedulers/compilers.

We also had discussions with various potential users of the chip. Including with colleagues at the University of Wisconsin on the genomics use case and other use cases in machine learning. On the business side, the core ideas from the proposal were part of a startup formed by the PI, and over the years that startup grew to 30+ employees and raised nearly $20M of funding from external investors, and has started production of a commercial chip.

The students working on the project obtained a unique exposure to entrepreneurship and industry-standard chip implementation and software tools. The technology developed helps continue IT innovation thereby helping many industries and technical leadership of the United States.

The new technology is expected to dramatically reduce the cost and size of existing terahertz systems.

This project addresses the need to increase the power output and simplify processing of continuous-wave room-temperature terahertz quantum cascade laser sources as they translate from research discovery toward commercial application. This will be achieved by using high-quality materials growth, thermal packaging, and innovations in the device active region and waveguide designs. These innovations are expected to boost the power output from the current record of 14 microwatt to over 50 microwatt and simplify device processing.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, two graduate students in the Electrical Engineering program and one student in the Master's of Science in Technology Commercialization program, will receive a unique experience of advancing a complex semiconductor device technology to applications.

Frequency-agile continuous-wave THz sources are highly desired for THz applications because (a) their narrowband emission frequencies can be selected to fall between atmospheric water absorption lines, (b) they can be used as local oscillator sources for heterodyne THz detectors, high-resolution spectroscopy, and gas sensing, and (c) their radiation can be detected using highly-sensitive room-temperature Schottky-diode based detectors.

The new device configuration outcouples terahertz radiation through the top laser surface using a specially-designed metal grating. Following theoretical optimization, the laser was experimentally realized in the University of Texas at Austin cleanroom and tested in the laboratory. High-performance operation was confirmed. The laser operated in pulsed mode at room temperature and delivered over 0.1 mW of peak power output at 1.9 THz frequency. This is the highest output power achieved to date with surface-outcoupled terahertz quantum cascade laser sources at room temperature. The results have been presented at the Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics in San Jose, CA in May 2018 and published in Applied Physics Letters journal in October 2018. The device configuration is suitable for implementing lasers that can operate continuous-wave (rather than pulsed) at room-temperature. Continuous-wave operation results in higher average power output that is useful for applications. However, due to a number of technical problems, continuous-wave operation of the laser at room temperature could not be demonstrated by the concluding date of this project. Nevertheless, the device configuration appears to be extremely promising for implementing continuous-wave lasers and the efforts towards demonstrating room-temperature continuous-wave operation of similar devices will be continued through other projects.

This approach to water purification will address the need for technologies with the capability of removing toxic chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, chemical waste products, and pesticides that can not be effectively removed using conventional means.? This?high throughput water purifier is important because?it has the potential to remove most organic contaminants from water as well as to disinfect the water of harmful viruses and bacteria.  The technology can be used in water reuse applications where wastewater can be treated with this plasma method to reduce contaminant levels well below maximum allowable concentrations so that it can be utilized for both potable (drinking) and non-potable applications (such as boiler water, car washing and firefighting).  This capability makes communities resilient against drought and even chemical spills.  The technology also has the potential to reduce industrial costs and associated environmental damage by treating highly toxic wastewater to the point where it can be reused at the factory.??

This project will result in a prototype high throughput plasma purifier and will test the plasma purifier at actual municipal and industrial wastewater plants to demonstrate function and scalability in a real setting. The high throughput plasma purifier has the following unique features:?1) scalability, 2) it does not require consumables to operate, and 3) it drives a multitude of chemical processes in water that rapidly reduce contaminants to carbon dioxide and water.?These features provide the advantages?of performance, e.g. rapid decomposition of contaminants and cost savings, does not require consumables such as toxic chlorine or peroxide, offers high electrical and chemical conversion efficiency, and provides ease of implementation ranging from point-of-use applications to integration as modules into an actual water treatment plant. ?Conventional advanced oxidation methods supporting water treatment applications require the use of toxic consumables to drive specialized reactions to generate oxidants as well as the infrastructure to house and apply the chemicals. The high throughput purifier produces plasma for water treatment using regular air thereby eliminating the need for costly consumables and the associated expense of infrastructure to store and apply such chemicals. 

This project addresses the technology gap of scalability as it translates from research discovery?toward commercial application. Though plasma-based water treatment has been investigated in the past, with impressive decomposition efficiencies, its widespread application has remained elusive.   This is due largely to the difficulty in scaling up beyond laboratory demonstration of 10s of ml in fixed volumes to the 10s of liters/min in once-through, flowing water applications. The key innovation of this reactor is the geometrical deconstruction of water into a form such that plasma coverage of water flowing through the reactor is maximized.  The surface plasma reacts with the water generating radicals that subsequently treat the core water. In the course of executing this proposed effort, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in applied science, technology translation, product development, and entrepreneurship. This effort will also administer a hands-on technical workshop aimed at K-12 students with focus on women and under-represented minorities that explores advanced water treatment and entrepreneurship.

The project engages a number of key partners. These partners include the a municipal waste water plant, a municipal drinking water plant, a semiconductor manufacturing company, and two engineering consultancies that actually design drinking and waste water plants, and the National Sanitation Foundation.  In this manner, municipal drinking water and wastewater, industrial wastewater, and advanced water testing facilities will be made available to this project supporting piloting in a relevant test environment and assessing the effectiveness of treatment based on accepted standards in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.","Foster, John E and Mujovic, Selman and Groele, Joseph and Blankson, Isaiah M~Towards high throughput plasma based water purifiers: design considerations and the pathway towards practical application~Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics~51~2018~~~10.1088/1361-6463/aac816~10091877~293001~10091877~OSTI~04/04/2020 17:01:54.323000000",,"Freshwater is vital to life here on Earth.  In its most assessible form-- rivers, streams and lakes--freshwater constitutes less than 1% of the 2.5 % of the total water that is fresh on this planet. Freshwater availability is under constant threat from population growth and overdevelopment, pollution, competition between human needs and industry/large scale agriculture, and climate change.  Water reuse  is a potential solution to managing this limited resource.  Water reuse (directly potable) refers to the processing of treated water from a water reclamation plant by an advanced water treatment facility which is then sent to the drinking water plant. Here nothing is wasted.  The issue with water reuse is assuring that concentration levels of contaminants--both microbial and chemica--are sufficiently low. The solution to this issue is advanced water treatment. The scalable, plasma reactor developed under this NSF funded activity aims to use plasmas to treat water contaminated with microbes and chemicals.  Interestingly, the active ingredient in this reactor is plasma--an ionized gas(often called the fourth state of matter)--that is generated at atmospheric pressure, so no special pumps are needed.  The plasma generated is also cold (essentially room temperature) and can be considered a glowing chemically activated gas.  In fact, when this type of plasma interacts with water it exposes the water to UV light, electrons, ions and reactive molecules. These contact the water and generate molecules that attack contaminants and microbes essentially dissolving them away to water and carbon dioxide for example. This process takes advantage of oxidation and also reduction.  The problem with plasma treatment of contaminated water is scaleup. The treatment is at the water surface so treatment times can be long--relying on diffusion to transport active species into the bulk of the water. This makes it quite difficulty to scale up the process to treat large volumes of water (typically millions of gallons a day at a typical water treatment plant!).  Our device developed under this NSF project, which has heritage with a previous NSF research effort aimed at understanding how plasmas interact with liquids, uses geometry and ionization waves to circumvent this scale up issue.  This device divides the water into very thin, narrow water jets or streams with very high surface area and small volume.  The plasma reactor generates two types of plasma--one in between the water streams and another type that--an ionization wave-- hugs the surface of the liquid treated it directly!  The combination of these two types of plasmas enables the injection of large treatment dose into a multitude of small volumes before recombining into regular pipe flow.  We effectively treat the volume of the liquid and thus circumvent the slow diffusion issue associated with conventinal surface treatment. The method is scalable in that one can use many of our jet stream or showerhead applicators in parallel to treat an arbitrary amount of water flow either continuously or in batch treatment mode. What?s also remarkable about this device is that it makes plasma out of regular air, so it doesn?t need any special type of gas to operate.   A key aspect of this work was to quantify the ability to vary the relative concentration of active species injected in the water. This is critical since the treatment does depends on water quality--which can change depending on weather (storm water runoff), algal blooms, brackish water intrusion, or chemical spills.  The plasma water reactor developed demonstrated the capacity to vary the ratio of oxidants generated such as ozone and peroxide simply by varying power supply settings.  This enables on the fly control of treatment --essentially at the touch of a dial on the power supply.  The reactor also demonstrated the capacity to treat a range of contaminated water.   Several in-lab pilot studies were carried out.  The reactor demonstrated the capacity to remove textile mill dye from water and waste water effluent.  1,4 dioxane contamination of ground water is of  concern in many municipalities in Michigan and throughout the U.S.  The reactor demonstrated the capacity to reduce this contaminant below action levels as well.  More recently the reactor was piloted to address the PFAS/PFOS contamination problem.  The reactor treated raw ground water heavily contaminated with PFOS (a persistent, cancer causing industrial chemical present in ground water) and was able to reduce its concentration by nearly 100 percent, clearly demonstrating the capacity for the reactor to destroy even the most recalcitrant contaminants. A fully automated demonstration reactor has been built with a treatment capacity &gt; 5 gallons/min in addition to the minimum viable product test article. This larger unit is powered by a power supply supplied funded in part by a donation from the Anthropocene Institute.  The reactor was recently awarded a US patent and the University is actively pursuing license agreements for this technology.  Also, start-up company has been formed based on this technology.

A wide range of electronic, microwave, and optical devices that use these thin films are commonplace in existing and future computers, automobiles, mobile communication systems (cell phones), etc. The capability of accurately monitoring thin film properties such as film thickness, mass, viscosity, electrical conductivity and permittivity during film deposition will improve the performance of consumer electronics that depend on these devices. The features associated with the LFE monitor will provide higher sensitivity when compared to the leading competing technology, the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) in this market space, and allow electrical conductivity and permittivity monitoring which are not possible with QCM.

The lateral field excited acoustic wave sensor under development is targeted for industrial factories and research laboratories which fabricate solid state electronic, microwave and optical devices that employ thin films critical to the device performance. In contrast to the commonly used QCM, the LFE device will allow the accurate and sensitive in situ monitoring of both mechanical (mass, film thicknesses and viscosity) and/or electrical (conductivity and permittivity) film properties. However, before this technology can be transitioned to a viable commercial product, two technology gaps have to be filled. First, the LFE device admittance response needs to be improved. Although the current LFE response is adequate for implementation in laboratory instrumentation, a larger change in admittance magnitude and phase is needed to realize a commercial sensor. The second gap involves the design and testing of an oscillator circuit in which the LFE device is a feedback element. In this configuration, the change in oscillator frequency becomes a direct measure of the change in film mechanical and/or electrical properties. 

University of Maine (UM) faculty in Electrical Engineering and Business Entrepreneurship and Fil-Tech engineers will advise undergraduates and graduate MS and PhD students in acoustic wave technology and/or business entrepreneurship necessary to realize a laboratory prototype that can be transitioned into a commercial product. In order to prepare the LFE sensor for technology transfer and commercialization, the UM Department of Industrial Cooperation will work with Fil-Tech, Inc. to develop intellectual property licensing.  

The project engages Fil-Tech Inc. to provide customized quartz samples and guidance critical in transitioning this technology to a viable commercial product.","Hartz, Jequil S. and Emanetoglu, Nuri W. and Howell, Caitlin and Vetelino, John F.~Lateral field excited quartz crystal microbalances for biosensing applications~Biointerphases~15~2020~~~10.1116/6.0000144~10161369~030801~10161369~OSTI~12/06/2020 21:01:52.103000000, Hartz, Jequil S. and Vetelino, John F. and Emanetoglu, Nuri W.~Investigation of Energy Trapping of the Lateral Field Excited Thickness Shear Mode in AT-Cut Quartz Crystal Microbalances~2019 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)~~2019~~~10.1109/ULTSYM.2019.8926227~10136162~596 to 599~10136162~OSTI~25/02/2020 13:01:53.56000000",,,THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE

The invented Li-S batteries are important because they can deliver up to five times higher energy density compared to current commercial Li-ion batteries that have over 90% market share in various applications including computers, tablets, phones, drones, and electric vehicles.? Furthermore, the invented Li-S batteries can be charged and discharged 800 times with high (80~90%) capacity retention, and the price of the raw material (sulfur) is at least 300 times lower than that of cobalt-containing active materials used in Li-ion batteries.  Since modern life includes various electronic/electrical devices that have made electrical energy storage indispensable, potential impacts from high energy density and low-cost rechargeable batteries are important.  The most important unique feature of the invented Li-S batteries is a?high sulfur (active material) loading in the sponge cathode, which allows for storing a large amount of energy in actual battery packs. ?The project will result in a continuous bulk-manufacturing method of the sponge for commercial mass-production as well as optimum synthesis conditions to control the pore size and morphology of the sponge.  

This project addresses the technology gaps related to mass-production as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The high sulfur loading is enabled by the sponge-like porous bulk, serving as an excellent electron transport channel and polysulfide reservoir.  The covalently connected CNTs not only provide excellent electron transport channels, but also completely eliminate insulating binders (inactive materials) that are used in typical Li-ion batteries to hold powdery raw materials.  To mass-produce the CNT sponge, the researchers will investigate a method of continuously delivering the catalyst to the reaction zone as well as optimum reaction conditions for continuous bulk manufacturing.  Then the pore size and surface condition of the CNT will be optimized to maximally accommodate sulfur loadings for higher performances.  Finally battery prototypes will be fabricated for testing and comparison with the current commercial Li-ion batteries.  

This project will provide graduate students with unique opportunities in the process of technology transfer in addition to technology development such as engaging the students in lab-to-market processes as well as educating how to deliver technical information to business and non-technical consumers.

Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), there have been extensive amount of studies for CNT over several decades. Although CNT has been turned out to have various exceptional properties compared to conventional materials such as high strength, high electrical conductivity, and high thermal conductivity, it has been difficult to utilize them practically for many reasons. One of the reasons is the difficulty in making tangible bulk structures out of the nanoscale CNT materials. Successfully implementation of our roll-to-roll design brings CNT to a practical material. Our CNT sponge is 3D bulk with a free-standing structure so this can be utilized for various other applications that have not been accomplished by powdery CNTs. The completion of the roll-to-roll process for carbon nanotubes allows for further research and implementation of carbon nanotubes as the price will decrease, and larger scale CNT applications may be possible. The major goals include development of a process and setup to continuously synthesize CNT in a form of porous films so that the films can be directly used as electrodes for battery applications as well as characterization and performance evaluation of the CNT as battery electrodes.

Key outcomes include topics related to the following. (1) Current/future Technology Translation and Commercialization Strategy - We have a roll-to-roll synthesis setup with completed heaters and controllers. Current results indicate that our design is feasible for commercializing the technology. The next step will be testing different substrate for specific purposes, further improving CNT film qualities and production rates. With those research accomplished, a prototype of continuously growing CNT film system will be demonstrated for commercializing the technology. (2) Substrate and Catalyst Delivery for Continuous CNT Synthesis - We have modified the parameters in CVD process and are able to deposit uniform CNT on Ni-coated carbon veil substrate in the modified tube furnace. The rate of the deposition shows feasibility of using carbon veil in our roll-to-roll setup. For continuous roll-to-roll process, the pressure control is the key factors in open synthesis system. We showed that the chemical impregnation method can be applied in the roll-to-roll system because nickel ion, catalyst for CNT synthesis, could be delivered in liquid phase for reaction with carbon source, ethanol, which could grow CNTs in a lower pressure environment. (3) Optimization of Pore sizes and Functional Groups - The most important and controllable porosity and surface properties of CNT sponges have been improved and optimized by in-operando study under a dark-field optical microscope. The edge-exfoliated graphitic layer can improve lithium ion diffusivity and intercalation, resulting in higher capacity of lithium storage capacity before dendrite growth on the surface. Based on our experiments, one of the current drawbacks is a limited lithium diffusion by clogging the neck of the scaffolds despite hybride lithiophilic/phobic surface, which means that the CNT scaffold thickness should be optimized for efficient volumetric and specific energy density. Two types of MnO2 CNT were developed by thermal decomposition and hydrothermal method, respectively. The one with mossy &alpha;- MnO2 morphology has better electrochemical performance for this anode application.

Broader Impacts: 

The research outcomes have been published in journal and conference. Our technology has been actively advertised to various companies and venture capitals. Carbon nanotubes have many application fields in material science, including structure material, battery, fuel cell, supercapacitor, thermoelectric, and so on. However, they were not practical due to the price and product forms. The limitation will be overcome by our mass production of free-standing 3D CNT bulks, which will significantly impact other disciplines. The lowered price will also enable many products using CNT to be much more attainable.

This project educates graduate and undergraduate student in energy storage, nanomanufacturing, and electrochemical systems. Graduated/undergraduate students had professional development opportunities by participating in this project. In the design and fabrication of the housing, the students were train to manage all the process, from blueprint design with Solidworks, material selection, communication and fabrication with the machine shop, system assembly and trial testing. The theoretical knowledge and practical experiment skills are also improved while improving the outcome of material synthesis. To determine the property of carbon nanotube, the students are trained to characterize the morphology and structure of material. The research skills, such as material functionalization, battery assembling and testing, are also well trained. Beside research skills, the students participated in technology translation and commercialization. The students presented our technology to investors. With such face to face communication with investors, the students acquired communication experience to investors, skills to pitch their business plan, feedback from the investors and industry. The PI and students attended the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II Grantee Conference and met R&amp;D folks in companies and investors.

The developed technology aims to improve treatment of atrial fibrillation, which has an estimated the prevalence of 2.7-6.1 million in the United States, with 200,000 new cases annually.  The developed real-time, magnetic resonance, imaging-guided, robotic catheter technology will significantly improve the accuracy and repeatability of the atrial fibrillation ablation therapy, compared to the state-of-the-art manually controlled catheters.  This technology will also reduce costs by decreasing time in the operating room, reducing the need for repeat procedures due to incomplete treatment, and reducing adverse events and complications.  In this project, the investigators will develop a proof-of-concept prototype of the robotic catheter system that will be used in subsequent early validation studies.

This project addresses the technology gaps in synergistically integrating high-speed magnetic resonance imaging technologies with robotic motion planning and control techniques, to develop a novel co-robotic system.  In the proposed paradigm, the atrial fibrillation ablation will be performed under intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging guidance, and conventional manually controlled intravascular catheters will be replaced with robotic catheters actuated by the magnetic resonance imaging system. The location of the catheter tip and the target tissue will be measured by magnetic resonance imaging in real-time. The robotic control algorithms will then use this information to actively control the catheter tip. Intra-operative availability of magnetic resonance imaging, with its superior tissue discrimination capabilities, would allow real-time evaluation of the substrate depth and lesion created by ablation. 

In addition, personnel involved in this project, in particular, one postdoctoral and one graduate student, will receive training in innovation and technology commercialization through participating in technology innovation and entrepreneurship education programs.","Greigarn, Tipakorn and Poirot, Nate Lombard and Xu, Xinyang and Cavusoglu, M.

The milli-electrode array (MEA) is important because waste treatment systems (e.g. wastewater, food waste) have been operated like a ""black box"" and monitored using ""single point"" probes without obtaining a whole picture of system operational status. This new technology will lead to an improved ability to monitor and control the operation of these systems and increase their commercial potential to transform waste material into valuable fuels and other products. In addition, the ability to economically produce milli-electrode arrays with multiple parameter sensing capability could lead to their application in other system monitoring situations such as other types of biochemical reactors.  

The project will result in a prototype development and full-scale demonstration of MEA technology. This state-of-the-art MEA sensor has following unique features: sturdy configuration with long lifetime, simple measurement procedure, low-cost durable materials, and easy deployment and replacement. These features provide the following advantages: real-time profiling of multiple parameters spatiotemporally, durable inexpensive rapid sensing, and complete datasets to reflect system operational status at lowest capital cost. 

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. First, with an anaerobic digestor (AD) as the testbed, integration of the heterogeneous datasets generated by MEA profiles into AD control and management will be explored, which will enable the adjustment of AD operational status in real-time, accommodate gradients across the whole system, and catch the early warnings of system problems before malfunction. Second, the occurrence of biofouling from particles and microorganisms in wastewater will be prevented by utilizing novel anti-fouling materials (e.g. hydrophilic film, gold and silver nanoparticles printed on mm-sized electrodes). Third, an impedance reading will be used to detect early fouling of MEA sensors. The impedance of working MEA sensors will be periodically measured and compared with the clean MEA sensors to catch the surface property changes under fouling, so that the MEA accuracy will not be sacrificed in the long-term profiling.  In addition, personnel involved in this project (two doctorate students with one for MEA prototype development and the other for MEA deployment in AD systems) will receive hands on innovation entrepreneurship experiences by working with PIs and Co-PIs in customer discovery interviews, UConn School of Engineering Entrepreneur Leadership Training Course, and MEA business model canvas development.

The project is motivated by the opportunity to fill the gap in clinical practice and educational reading assessment by developing an ecological assessment of reading comprehension and retention. The assessment includes an automated evaluation of (a) immediate and delayed (24 hour) reading comprehension; and (b) reading strategy use and study skills using text appropriate for struggling readers in late high school and college. The integrated assessment and intervention program, RULE, will be of great interest to clinicians and educators responsible for working with students who have high level challenges in reading as currently there are no validated tools. The primary product will be a prototype of an automated assessment of reading comprehension that includes an evaluation of readers' use of Before Reading Strategies (e.g., preview with activation of existing knowledge), During Reading Strategies (e.g., notetaking, highlighting, and periodic review strategies), and Review Strategies (e.g., summarization and self testing strategies).  The assessment will be integrated with a reading strategy training program that was developed by the project team in their previous NSF CampusReader project. The automated and ecological nature of the RULE assessment will be desirable to the large market space of clinicians and educators who have very limited time thus are unable to personalize assessment and interventions as is required for high level reading comprehension impairments.

This project addresses the problem of appropriate use of clinician-time during assessment. It uses technology that can assist the clinician by automating tedious and error-prone portions of an assessment. In particular: (1) it will infer reading-strategy use from the reader's interaction with the RULE interface, and (2) when students are asked to provide a written summary of what they have read, RULE will automate assessment of that summary and potentially link errors in the summary with errors in use of reading-strategies, i.e., link writing errors with reading errors.

Results of evaluation of the RULE tool provided preliminary evidence of concurrent validity and reliability (Kucheria et al., 2018).

The project was successful in automating the measurement of Content Information Units (CIU rate) in order to calculate free recall of content which has not previously been used a measure of reading comprehension clinically given the lack of feasibility to transcribe and calculate the CIU rate. The programming was successful in the partial automation but transcription remained cumbersome and would be the next area to address.

The most innovative and complex outcome was the development of an automated assessment of reading strategy use. Currently no tools exist to detect a reader's use of strategies. The RULE tool has a computer algorithm that was applied to detect 9 key reading strategies by mapping reader strategies to computer behavior. A human observer documented the reading strategies employed by undergraduate readers which was compared to the RULE computer digital strategy detection program. There was 75% agreement or higher for 6 out of the 9 reading strategies which suggests proof of concept that a reader's approach to engaging with academic text can be objectively and automatically captured in a clinically feasible manner (Kucheria at al., 2019). [See image showing computer sequences mapped to reading strategies.]

Future efforts will focus on further development of the RULE tool and dissemination to clinical practitioners.

This SAW biosensor is important because proteins in blood and urine in pg/ml levels are prognostic and diagnostic markers for diseases such as cancer. This technology enables rapid, quantitative determinations of biomarkers in POC settings such as in a clinician's office; this could lead to faster diagnoses for patients.  The project will result in proof-of-concepts necessary for prototyping the SAW biosensor for POC applications.  This SAW biosensor has the following unique features: low, clinically-relevant detection limits in the pg/ml range, rapid quantification of disease biomarkers, POC detection from real matrices such as blood, and reduction in false determinations compared to existing technologies. These features provide the following advantages: accuracy, small size, cost savings, and ease of use when compared to any of the leading competing technologies based on optical, acoustic or electrical sensing principles in this market space.  

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: (1) operation directly from complex matrices by removing non-specifically bound (NSB) proteins using acoustic streaming generated by Rayleigh SAWs, (2) rapid determinations necessary in clinical settings by improving incubation times via acoustic streaming induced mixing, (3) lowered detection limits to clinically-relevant levels by manipulation of shear-horizontal SAWs using phononic structures combined with the use of functionalized nanoprobes, and (4) integration of these features on a small sensor platform for POC applications. Based on the utilization of ST quartz, a piezoelectric substrate that is shown to support SAWs of shear-horizontal and shear-vertical polarizations in orthogonal directions, sensing, NSB removal and mixing functions are brought to bear on a single sensing area.  This allows for small, rapid, label-free sensor micro-arrays to be fabricated for quantification of multiple biomarkers, thus enabling POC monitoring of disease biomarker panels at clinically-relevant concentrations.  Additionally, incorporation of microcavity arrays in the sensor configuration will push sensitivity higher and limits of detection lower.  Combined with nanoprobes constructed using gold nanoparticles, detection limits in the pg/ml level for cancer biomarkers are demonstrated in this project.  NSB removal and mixing using acoustic streaming and configuration of these phenomena with sensing will transform POC biosensor technology.  This SAW biosensor is suitable for detection from other complex matrices of interest to food safety and environmental monitoring as well.

Interactions with bicycles are rare for a typical motorist, therefore safety-conscious drivers naturally focus on other motor vehicles in the roadway, and may not become aware of the presence of a bicycle until it is too late. In contrast, interactions with motor vehicles are commonplace for a bicyclist. Furthermore, the bicyclist faces far greater consequences in an accident than a motorist. Therefore it is appropriate for a collision prevention system to be the responsibility of the cyclist. Continuous display of bright flashing lights or loud sounds may suffice to bring attention to the cyclist, but they may unnecessarily distract nearby motorists, or they may alarm passing drivers, and cause them to move dangerously far from their own lane. The system under development will guide motorists to pass bicycles with exactly as much distance as safety requires. Furthermore, it will provide alerts only to those drivers that have a significant probability of collision with the bicycle. The system to be developed will incorporate a knowledge base of likely collision scenarios, thus minimizing false alarms. The system will provide guidance cues to the bicyclist, to ensure a safe and respectful response to motor vehicles. Human factors studies will be used to design an alert system that provides motorists with specific and effective audio-visual cues. These studies will also be used to ensure that cyclists do not respond to the enhanced security by becoming more reckless. It is expected that the technology developed in this project will enable motorists to interact with bicycles safely and with minimal intrusion. It will reduce the approximately 48,000 bicyclist injuries and 700 fatalities that occur every year. 

The development of a bicycle-mounted collision avoidance system must address a number of challenges beyond those required for a similar system on a car. These challenges include the need to address more complex collision scenarios, the need to provide alerts to the drivers of other vehicles, the need for inexpensive, light and smaller sensors, and the need to rely on human users for effective functioning of the system. These challenges will be addressed by development of unique custom-designed sensors, novel estimation algorithms for vehicle tracking and use of a rigorous human factors study to determine which warning systems will be effective and how such warnings should be provided to the involved motorist and bicyclist in real-world traffic scenarios. The warning presentation is designed to minimize the trade-offs between low reaction time and unnecessarily intrusive disturbances to nearby motorists. The custom sensors developed in the project include a triad sonar transducer unit for side vehicles, and front and rear laser sensors on real-time controlled rotational laser platforms to track vehicles at continuously changing lateral and longitudinal distances. The human factors studies in the project will enhance our understanding of human behavior in multi-modal collision avoidance systems and analyze possible long-term changes in behavior after prolonged use of the system. The project also includes an intensive 6-month field operational test in collaboration with an industrial partner to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed technology. The field operational tests will involve 10 bicycles, bicyclist volunteers with significant daily urban commutes and extensive analysis of bicycle data recorded in real-world traffic conditions. Due to the close industrial collaboration, the research conducted in this project will accelerate the path to commercialization of this smart system with its potential benefits to the country. The project will educate two graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher, providing them experience in inter-disciplinary research as well as an opportunity for strong industrial interaction.

To reshore jobs, improve operations, and recruit, retain, and retrain skilled workers, companies are increasingly using robotics technology. Ideally, robots will not replace humans but team with them to improve productivity. However, most industrial robots are poorly integrated into human workflow, causing expensive work stoppage problems ($1.7M per hour), worker stress, and talent loss.  The research goal of this project is to address this problem by designing novel methods to improve human-robot workflow and productivity in assembly manufacturing through the use of an intelligent material delivery system (IMDS), which will closely integrate with and support the manual work process. This project will investigate innovative, multi-disciplinary approaches to this research area, dramatically advancing the state-of-the art in smart manufacturing and human-centered robotics. 

The research team will make the following contributions to human-centered smart service systems: 1) Revolutionize the use of robotics in assembly manufacturing processes to closely support skilled human workers, enabling them to focus on tasks they value (their trade) as opposed to tasks that distract from their talent (material movement). 2) Dramatically improve the productivity and flexibility of factories through nimble, real-time scheduling of an IMDS system that dynamically incorporates real-time models of human workflow. 3) Deeply explore the socio-technical implications of having an IMDS system in the workplace, in terms of human workers' cognition, fatigue, affect, and job satisfaction. The project's approach serves as a direct contrast to industry state-of-the-art, which relies on strict bifurcation of human and robot work, and rigid delivery schedules that fail to take local trim-line variations into account. By closely integrating an IMDS into the manual work process and understanding worker and material status, the project will readily enable flexibility and reconfigurability of a human workforce, an absolute necessity in made-to-order, small-batch manufacturing settings. 

This project will help the US manufacturing sector dramatically improve their operations by using automation to directly support a talented, skilled workforce. It has the potential to impact all major US manufacturing sectors, including automotive, construction, healthcare, energy, and goods. It will help US companies reshore operations, as well as create new opportunities for US worker STEM skill acquisition. Furthermore, this project involves a detailed investigation of multiple human worker implications of the transition from traditional to intelligent material delivery using robotics. By understanding reactions to such change, there will be new understanding on how to optimize a system not only for workflow and task efficiency but also for the human experience. Such knowledge is critical to maintaining job satisfaction, safety and health, and long-term well-being of the human workforce.

Everyone has ideas but only a select few can bring them to fabrication. This is because of lack of intuitive and easy-to-use design tools, detailed knowledge required to make prototypes, help needed for users with difficulties, and access to fabrication facilities. This gap could be seen as a waste of untapped human creative resources and economic potential to the Nation. MAKERPAD will bridge the gaps between the need for design tools for personalized production and the rapid growth of 3D fabrication technologies by providing intuitive tools for designing and access to remote fabrication resources. Using the cloud, MAKERPAD will enable personalized fabrication technology easily accessible and available to makers and students.

MAKERPAD is enabled by (a) 3D mixed and augmented reality, (b) cloud-powered algorithms (shape modeling, computer vision, human computer interaction), and (c) service models supporting 3D scanning, searching and printing. Using the affordances created by depth sensing cameras that are being embedded into both mobile and intuitive fabrication oriented design modeling, smart algorithms will be enabled to work real-time over the cloud. MAKERPAD will develop and use the human-centric cognitively intuitive design interfaces, digital modeling in the virtual cloud world, thus enabling connectivity to a personalized fabrication network. Using a new robotic toy platform as well as accessories as the use case, the service model design will appropriately support consumers at various levels of capabilities. The workflow at the user and system level will be designed in a seamless fashion for the users to obtain laser cut and 3D printed models of their designs. If successful, this system will support different levels of service, quality and sophistication of digital designs and physical models depending on the user requirements, usage context, budget and time constraints. The smart system will dynamically configure the appropriate technologies, providers and approaches, such as Do-It-Yourself (DIY) as well as concierge services, to deliver the optimal level of solution to the user.

The application of this technology spans existing plastic compounding as well as providing the ability to produce new polymers that require more complex mixing. The application of EMEs will improve the extrusion process and will allow new classes of polymers to be designed and brought to market leading to new, better performing, functional, lightweight products.  

The project will result in prototype EMEs optimized for both twin- and single-screw extruders. These are unique in that they provide much improved dispersive mixing due to the extension-dominated flow through stationary hyperbolically contracting channels. Preliminary results have shown significant improvement in the mixing of nanocomposites and immiscible polymer blends by comparison with standard kneading block-configured extruders.  

This project addresses a critical technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Intermeshing co-rotating twin-screw extruders (co-TSE) are the equipment of choice for compounding of filled polymer systems and masterbatches, polymer melt homogenization, modification and blending mainly because of their good distributive and dispersive mixing capabilities. The mixing action in co-TSEs is usually imparted via sets of kneading blocks, which impart intensive shear on the material and some, but less, extension. Since shear flows are energetically inefficient for dispersive mixing by comparison with extensional flows, there is much room for optimization. Similarly, single-screw extruders are the most widespread type of extruder worldwide because even though they are typically poor mixing devices, they also allow for large throughputs. Again, it is highly desired to develop single-screw extruders with improved compounding ability, while maintaining their good pump characteristics. 

In the case of twin-screw extruders, the EME concept will be optimized by defining the minimum and maximum geometrical configurations admissible, e.g., contraction ration and length, which lead to improved mixing without an undue penalty in pressure drop and machine wear and tear. This will allow a better understanding of the design rules of the EMEs and perform upscaling to industrial-sized machines. In the second phase of this project, we propose to expand the EME concept to SSEs and thus improve significantly their mixing ability, while maintaining their excellent melt pump characteristics. This ability to achieve much finer and controlled structures and morphologies in polymer blends and composites TSEs and the transformation of SSEs into efficient compounders while maintaining their excellent pump characteristics will be transformational for the practice.

The project will involve one graduate student who will develop first-hand knowledge of how to interact with top-level manufacturing companies. Besides preparing the technical documents, the student will participate in phone conversations/meetings with the potential customers, pre-meetings and post meeting debriefs, thus imparting him/her with first-hand familiarity with industry-directed research with deliverables, product development, project management and the ability to navigate high pressure situations. In addition, the student will have a tailored plan of studies, which will include courses from the CWRU Masters in Engineering Management, thus furthering his/her ability to develop these competencies.",,,"The main objective was to build Extensional Mixing Element (EME) prototypes optimized for both twin-screw extruders (TSE) and single-screw extruders (SSE) and explore the commercialization potential of these devices. This includes:

1. Define the design space of TSE EMEs. High Viscosity vs. low viscosity; pressure drop.

2. Fabricate TSE EME prototypes, test them and develop upscaling methodology.

3. Improve both dispersive and distributive mixing abilities of SSEs, while keeping their excellent pumping characteristics.

4. Fabricate a SSE screw with modular metering zone, test various mixing geometry combinations and develop upscaling methodologies. 

In first year of the project, we started with understanding the design constraints of EMEs, that is, optimizing number of channels with contraction ratios and introduction of double hyperbolic contraction, that is, both horizontal and vertical contractions. So keeping in mind all the constraints, we designed different complex EME geometries using Solidworks. The next step was making flow paths out of these designs and then performing viscoelastic 3D simulations using ANSYS Polyflow. For TSE, as the EMEs are static so rotating inflow condition was applied and for SSE, the EMEs are rotating so static conditions were applied. After having simulations on different combinations of designs, analysis was done to choose the best prototypes and start manufacturing them. Once manufacturing was done, we moved to second phase of project.

In second year of the project, these EME prototypes were experimentally tested using very low viscosity Polyethylene (PE; Injection Molded grade) just to check the pressures; the testing was successful. So we moved forward with experiments on Single Screw Extruder (SSE) using Polystyrene (PS)/Polypropylene (PP) blends with composition ratio of 20/80 and of various viscosity ratios (0.4, 1 and 7). We used three screw configurations: Regular Fin screw (Only Distributive), Single hyperbolic EME Screw (Dispersive + Distributive) and Double hyperbolic EME (more aggressive; Dispersive + Distributive)  screw. We just replaced one conveying element (one L/D) with 2 EMEs (half L/Ds each), meaning all screw configurations had same number of Pineapple mixing elements. These tests were performed at various flow rates and rotation speed. Once all the extrusions were done, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed for all the extruded materials and then image analysis was performed to analyse the number of droplets and their sizes. The same screw configurations on SSE were used to run three compsite material system, where we used PS as matrix (98.5%) and three different fillers (Carbon black (CB), Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) and Graphene Nanoplatelets (GNP)) of 1.5%. Again, these experiments were performed at different flow rates and rotation speeds. These extruded materials were analyzed using Optical microcopy to see agglomerate sizes. For both blend and composite systems, Capillary rod die was used for SSE experiments.

Also, experiments were performed on TSE using the same composite material system as above mentioned. Three screw configurations were used: Regular Kneading block configuration, Single hyperbolic EME configuration and Double hyperbolic EME configuration. The extruded materials were analyzed using optical microscopy and the results were compared with SSE results to see if EME in SSE makes them as better compounder as TSE.

The main outcomes could be summarized out of all the experiments as:

1. EMEs are made more aggressive by incorporating a vertical contraction, that is, making them double hyperbolic.

2. A novel modular metering zone was developed for SSE where we could place EME in the Fin screw so that it can simultaneously perform both dispersive and distributive mixing.

3. Adding EME to the Fin mixing screw doesn't change pressure build up and there is almost no penalty in flow rate as well but in turn we are getting much better mixing.

4. For both blend and composite systems, EME is making SSE a better compounder.

5. For blend with viscosity ratio of 7 and in higher flow rates, double hyperbolic EME performs way better than single hyperbolic EME.

6. SSE (using EME) is performing almost the same as regular (Kneading block) TSE for PS/CNT and PS/GNP system. And EME in TSE makes it much better mixer than with Kneading block TSE.

7. EMEs were also found to increase mechanical properties in PP (Polypropylene) Composite systems when extruded in TSE using EMEs. 

8. This work resulted in a patent and also the work was presented at ANTEC Orlando and PPS Taiwan Conferences. and resulted in 4 research papers published in international peer-reviewd jornals.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that, as a platform technology, the proposed system can be easily ported for use in a range of applications including: sports performance, physical therapy, medical diagnostics markets, and many others.  The method of fabricating this sensing system, using additive print manufacturing technology, may have a profound technological and economic impact on the emerging printed-electronics industry, It demonstrates the capability to manufacture cost effective, flexible, conformable and light weight electronic devices. The adoption of this new technology will be of particular importance to those seeking to develop wearable electronic devices. The commercialization of this product will also validate the ability to fabricate electronic devices with sensor performance comparable to that of silicon based devices. In terms of cost efficiency, the use of printing technology for fabricating sensing systems is anticipated to reduce the average production cost by approximately 70%. The long-term goal of this project is to use this technology to develop a range of smart, wearable sensors to detect impacts that causes injuries and improve diagnostics. For example, an identifiable market for this technology already exists, that is, for protective headgear.

Impact-related traumatic brain injuries often result from concussions.  The complications associated with concussions increase for unreported injuries, often left untreated, when compared to injuries that receive prompt medical attention. In many cases the current methods of relying on self-reported injuries runs the risk of aggravating a potentially dangerous head injury. This team's technology would help reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury by automatically detecting and recording the occurrences of potentially dangerous impacts.

(1) Assess the market: The team learned that, as a platform technology, the system can be easily ported for application in the sports performance, physical therapy and medical diagnostics markets. US protective sports equipment market for sports such as football, ice-hockey, wrestling, lacrosse, soccer, etc. was identified as the total addressable market (TAM) for this technology, with the US sports helmet market and the combined football/ice-hockey market being the serviced addressable market (SAM) and the target market (TM), respectively.

(2) Define the customer base: At the beginning of the program, the team hypothesized that the system could be sold as an add-on to existing helmets directly to the customers. However, during the customer interviews, the team soon realized that the initial market for the proposed system will be OEMs of football helmets and the end users would be players who use the helmets. The team concluded that the first targeted market application for this impact sensor technology will be deployment in high school football helmets.

(3) Determine the system features: During the NSF I-Corps program, the team developed a list of features for the product, based on customer feedback which includes (a) location of system on helmet, (b) information storage capability for history of impacts, (c) application for wireless transmission of impact data to the sideline in real-time, (d) point-of-impact mapping with impact intensity information, and (e) flexibility and conformability of the system within the helmet.

(4) Analyze the competitive landscape: The key results of the competitive landscape analysis, based on the customer interviews, was that this would be the only system that can offer the ability of ""point-of-impact mapping"" as well as be physically flexible and conformable. After discussions with the OEMs, the team understood that this system will ultimately bring superior value to the market, at a competitive price when compared to systems currently available.

(5) Build an ecosystem (strategic partners, material and component suppliers, manufacturers and supply chain): Based on the customer discovery process, a customer ecosystem for the product was developed. The team learned that the system can be sold to or licensed with OEMs such as helmet manufacturing companies who will then include this as a step-up feature or premium product line. The OEMs will obtain the necessary industry NOCSAE certification through the SEI testing laboratory. The team identified the decision makers, the economic buyer and the influencers, within the OEMThe team also mapped the sales channel and path from the OEM to the economic buyer of the product. The team also learned that reconditioning/service of helmets is performed annually by the OEMs during which time, the sensing system will also be checked and serviced at a minimal cost to the user.

(6) Decide costs associated at each level of the ecosystem: The team developed channel economics which includes the costs associated at different levels of the ecosystem. During this process, the team determined the cost at which the system will be sold to the OEMs which included the costs of goods sold (COGS), all sales/R&amp;D/G&amp;A costs and the operating profit. The team also determined the channel economics and costs if the OEM sold it directly or through sporting goods outlets (retail). In addition, a customer acquisition cost (CAC) and life-time value (LTV) were also calculated.

Following the successful completion of the NSF I-Corps program, the team submitted a follow-on grant proposal to the NSF PFI:AIR program on October 11, 2016. The proposal, titled ""Smart Helmet Impact Sensing System"" was ""Awarded"" on June 21, 2017 (Award No. 1701157) and will help in advancing the technology towards commercialization. In addition, the team also applied for the ADVANCE grant program, which is designed for augmenting proposals such as NSF PFI:AIR, on July 27, 2017. This proposal uses the NSF PFI:AIR grant as a matching fund and was ""Awarded"" on August 22, 2017.

Vibrio cholerae is a well-known freshwater pathogen that is of concern in developing countries.  Two lesser known, but important human pathogens in the USA are from the same bacterial group: Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus.  These are bacteria that are naturally found in estuarine systems, but they can also present a risk to human health when consumed in raw shellfish, or in rare cases, contacted in beach waters.  This project will translate knowledge gained through prior ecological research into technology that permits the design of user-friendly, rapid, molecular testing kits.  The existing ways to test for Vibrio species in water and shellfish samples are decades old, and they require 24-96 hours for results.  Even new molecular approaches  for testing of pathogenic forms of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus are compromised by a lack of specificity and/or a need for an enrichment step to improve sensitivity, making them require almost a day for completion. This project will permit generation of new, rapid molecular diagnostics for virulent forms of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus using a new approach for determining useful targets for the kits. It is envisioned that these kits could be used to 1) certify that shellfish is safe for raw consumption, 2) protect the health of at risk populations for water contact, 3) determine the patterns associated with dangerous forms of the bacteria for improved warning systems. The funded project will result in the design of commercially available molecular testing kits that will be easy to use, and will provide results in 2-3 hours.  These features will permit accurate public notification and protection of public health.

This project addresses a specific knowledge gap in the transition from research to commercial application.  Vibrio sp. are complex bacterial organisms, that are naturally found in estuarine and coastal waters, but only a small subset of them are capable of causing disease.  The assembled team has valuable expertise in next generation sequence and sequence data approaches, Vibrio sp. ecology, and Vibrio sp. pathogenicity. The combination of knowledge permits known virulent (pathogenic) Vibrio samples to be analyzed for specific sets of  ""DNA motifs"" that are related to the capability of the bacteria to cause disease.  From a repetitive process of analyzing known virulent and avirulent cells, the project team can identify the DNA motifs, or signatures that can be used to design a DNA test kit.  Subsequently, through support from this project the molecular test kits will be developed, optimized, validated, and commercialized.

In addition to the technical activities, undergraduates, senior graduate students, and post doctoral research associates as well as research assistant professors will be supported on this project. The will be exposed to a wide range of research and technology transfer activities, including market assessment, field based sampling and study, laboratory sample preparation, culture and molecular based analyses of samples, next generation sequence data annotation and analyses, and kit design and optimization. The project will be synergistic and contribute directly to the Molecular Training Facility run by PI Noble, where water quality professionals come to learn appropriate use of qPCR approaches and interpretation of qPCR data for water quality management.

 The project also engages the Marine Biotechnologies-Center of Innovation, a group dedicated to advancing the translation of marine science research to commercial application.  In addition, Orion Integrated Biosciences is a project partner.  Orion Integrated Biosciences is a company dedicated to the advancement of unique and disruptive computational approaches to survey ""big data"" for sequence and molecular application. This project will directly impact the advancement of marine metagenomics due to the fact that the project team is utilizing a holistic approach to target complex organisms. The project is novel in that the approach moves away from the ""single gene target"" qPCR design approach, permitting the generation of diagnostic kits that are rapid, and cost-effective that shellfish harvesting, and water quality managers can use to manage precious resources and protect public health.","Froelich, B.A., B.

We are at the cusp of a historic transformation of our energy system into a more sustainable form in the coming decades. Electrification of our transportation system will be an important component because, today, vehicles consume more than a quarter of our energy and emit more than a quarter of our energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2).  Electrification will not only greatly reduce CO2 emission, but EVs can also be critical resources to help integrate renewable sources, such as wind and solar power, into our electric grid.  One of the key enablers to mass EV adoption is the availability of smart charging networks.   

This project will design a set of novel and sophisticated algorithms that optimize a network of EV chargers, implement them in software, and pilot them in a Caltech garage where the researchers have already installed a network of programmable EV chargers.  It will serve as a prototype that validates the technology and business potential of next-generation adaptive charging network (ACN).  Compared with state of the art in the EV charging industry, ACN will enable massive deployment of smart chargers and provide the same charging capacity at a fraction of required infrastructure costs.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  At many workplaces in top EV cities in the US, there is a severe shortage of chargers relative to EVs, e.g., there is a charger for every 2-5 EVs.  In the future, this ratio should be closer to 1:1.  The bottleneck to a large-scale charging facility is, however, not the cost of electricity or chargers, but the limited capacity of electricity distribution system, as well as, in city centers, the real estate. The leading chargers in the current marketplace charge at their peak rates whenever EVs are plugged in. They cannot be deployed at scale without a prohibitively expensive upgrade of the electricity distribution system. The technologies to be developed in this project will optimally schedule the charging process of a network of adaptive chargers to satisfy energy requirements of all EVs within their deadlines without exceeding the capacity of the electricity distribution system whenever possible, and optimally and fairly allocate the available capacity among competing EVs otherwise.  The ACN therefore maximally utilizes the most expensive resources in a charging ecosystem to provide a target charging capacity at a much lower infrastructure cost, creating a compelling value proposition.

The project will apply tools from optimization theory, control and dynamical systems, and algorithm design.  The focus is to develop optimization software that will be ready for commercialization at the end of the project.  The project will involve undergraduate and graduate students.  In addition to research and software development, the project participants will be exposed to entrepreneurship and technology transfer.","Linqi Guo, Karl F. Erliksson and Steven H.

To drastically reduce greenhouse gases, we must electrify transportation and generate electricity from renewable sources. These create two societal needs: (i) the availability of mass electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, and (ii) the ability to integrate renewables.  The goals of this project is to develop technologies that will enable mass EV charging and a cleaner grid. 

Specifically, we have developed theory, algorithms and software to schedule EV charging based on user input and real-time state information.  The online algorithms are based on quadratic program where the objective is to schedule EV charging to track onsite real-time solar generation (charge faster when solar generation is high and vice versa), while satisfying user energy demands before their deadlines without exceeding the capacity limit of the electric infrastructure. The optimal charging algorithms can reduce the capital and operating costs of large-scale EV charging facilities by 30-60%.  They not only charge EVs efficiently, but can also provide energy services in the future.   

Our research has already led to the founding of a startup PowerFlex Systems by the PI and former members of the PI's Lab.  The PI's Lab has been working closely with PowerFlex Systems and Caltech Facilities to design, develop and deploy research results from this NSF project in the Adaptive Charging Network (ACN) at one of Caltech?s parking garages. ACN is capable of real-time measurement, communication, computation and actuation.

This project has provided training for graduate students in EV charging and smart grid technologies, algorithm design, and software implementation.  It has also exposed the graudate students to entrepreneurship in clean tech.  The Caltech ACN facility has been the basis for 16 undergraduate class projects between 2016 and 2018 for 22 undergraduates, including 4 female students.

Since 2016, Caltech ACN has delivered more than 425MWh of electricity,1,333,000 electric miles, and avoided more than 445 metric tons of greenhouse gases.  It has been charging ~50 EVs a day.  It is the first large-scale real-time adaptive EV charging facilitty in the industry.

These VOC sensors are important because of their strong impact on environmental protection and indoor air quality monitoring which has direct influence on human health and well-being.  The project will result in the development of a commercially viable prototype of a novel VOC sensor packaged in the form of a miniaturized handheld device. This VOC sensor has unique features of high sensitivity and selective detection of VOCs individually and in mixtures, and operation at low heater temperature without catalyst coating.   These features provide the advantages of faster and unique detection of VOCs in a complex environment, much lower power consumption, and higher reliability and operational lifetime, when compared to the leading competing pellistor and photo-ionization based sensors currently available in this market space.  

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The VOC sensor to be developed will address: (i) the inability of the current technologies to perform selective detection of analytes, (ii) higher operational power requirement due to high heater temperature, and low operational lifetime due to usage of a laser or catalyst coating. A combination of unique features of the proposed VOC sensor, including low heater temperature, lack of catalyst coating, and selective VOC detection utilizing their physical properties, enables it to address the aforementioned limitations of the current technology. In addition, the personnel involved in this project, at both graduate and undergraduate levels, will receive entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through participation in the project activities directly related to commercialization and mentorship from the industrial partner.

Walking with crutches requires significantly more energy than walking without a crutch, yet most of the recent advances have only focused on making crutches more comfortable.  Enhanced crutch walking efficiency is important because it can increase independence, improve stability, and reduce fatigue in the approximately six million individuals that rely on crutches for daily mobility.  This project will result in a feasible design for a kinetic crutch tip that makes crutch walking more efficient without requiring any external power.  It can also help users maintain control when walking down a slope by reducing their speed.  The kinetic crutch tip is expected to help existing crutch users gain additional mobility and allow more people to use crutches instead of wheelchairs and other more sedentary assistive devices that do not encourage the same level of daily activity.

This project addresses several technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Conventional crutch tips have a standard point or constant radius tip that cannot assist the user during walking; all forward progression forces must be generated by the user pushing themselves forward over the crutch. In contrast, the kinetic crutch tip uses a special shape to predictably redirect the user's downward force into a propulsive force that assists the individual in forward ambulation. This assistance is provided passively, so no motors or power supplies are required. The assistance force helps the individual use less energy while moving forward over level ground and when walking uphill. The crutch tip shape can be rotated to reverse the assistance force and provide a more controlled descent down a hill by reducing the user's momentum. The scientific challenge of this project lies in determining precisely what roll-over crutch tip shape should be used for each of the four commonly used crutch gait patterns and how the tip affects the gait dynamics and energy used during each crutch gait. The focus will be on the unstable and fast-moving swing-through crutch gait predominately used by short-term crutch users and on the more stable and slow-moving 2- 3- and 4-point crutch gait patterns typically used by long-term disabled individuals.

This is important because it will allow shortened production times, improved energy efficiency and a decrease in the cost of manufacturing of these freeze-dried products. The project is expected to result in a prototype Microscale In-plane Knudsen Radiometric Actuator (MIKRA) gas sensor that is based on Knudsen thermal force actuation. This gas sensor has the following unique features: simultaneous heat transfer and pressure measurement in a single device, dynamic tunability allowing the sensor to be calibrated in-situ and compatibility with standard microfabrication. These features provide the advantages of compactness, ease of installation and cost savings when compared to the leading competing process instrumentation technologies in this market space.

This project demonstrated that by combining modern wireless networking platforms with well-established MEMS sensor technologies, simultaneous in-process measurements of gas pressure at various locations within lyophilizer are now feasible. The measurements  of local pressure coupled with computational techniques to quantify vapor flow velocity provide a novel non-invasive method to determine key process parameters, namely the sublimation rate and product temperature. This cyber-physical process analytical technology based on measurements and flow computations allow the primary drying process to be executed with tighter margins, significantly accelerating drying rates. In the future, this information may be directly implemented into a closed-loop control method, allowing the product to be lyophilized at its most optimal rate throughout the entire cycle while simultaneously satisfying the constraints imposed on product temperature and equipment capability.

 

The project provided training of graduate and undergraduate students in rarefied gas dynamics, MEMS and vacuum technology, wireless networks and commercialization process for engineering inventions. Several publications and presentations have been produced as a result of this project and disseminated to engineering and pharmaceutical science and technology communities. The lead graduate researcher has been accepted to Purdue NSF I-Corps January 2019 cohort to advance the translation of the project findings into commercial technology.

AKI occurs in 5 - 7% of hospitalized patients and results in a mortality rate of about 50%. The financial costs of AKI are estimated to be 8 billion dollars per year, or about $130,000 per life-year saved. It is unlikely that this high mortality and associated cost will be reduced until there are better tools for the early diagnosis of renal injury. This project translates a quartz resonator based thermal biosensor concept into a biomedical instrumentation system for continuous monitoring of kidney function. The project will focus on prototype engineering, instrumentation, and extensive benchmarking with the aim to provide accurate and automated measurements of urine creatinine. Coupled with in-line urine flow, and periodic serum creatinine concentration measurements, a system for near-continuous creatinine clearance measurement in AKI patients will be developed. The unmatched stability, sensitivity, and reproducibility of this system will allow for collection of such data for clinical analysis and early detection of conditions such as sepsis. The sensor design based on enzyme immobilized alginate beads placed in a Kapton? tubing, as an easy to swap disposable cartridge represents a promising clinical diagnostic prototype demonstration with a viable business model.

This project will develop a calorimetric biosensor prototype based upon differential measurement as a way to compensate for background thermal effects. Development of a differential sensor is expected to improve both the sensitivity and the precision of measurement. The reproducibility, accuracy, and stability of the measurement system will be critically evaluated using urine samples. Intra-assay and inter-assay variability will be experimentally determined by repeated measurements and statistical methods. Accuracy will be determined by comparison of the creatinine concentrations determined by HPLC (the gold standard) and the quartz resonator. Agreement between the two methods will be determined by Bland-Altman analysis. Stability of the system will be determined by measuring the creatinine concentration of known creatinine test solutions at regular intervals over a period of 48 hours. The plot of measured concentration vs time will be used to determine the time to failure. In addition, personnel involved in this project, one graduate and one undergraduate student, will receive regulatory compliance experiences through collaboration with our partner company focused on improving patient outcomes through the successful implementation of innovative technology into medical devices. The team will be also participate in several commercialization conferences and events to establish strategic alliances and partnerships for the technology translation and commercialization.","David Gaddes and Srinivas Tadigadapa~Thermally Isolated Micromachined Quartz Resonator Array for Differential Micro-Calorimetric Measurements~Solid State Sensors, Actuators, and Microsystems Workshop, Hilton Head Island, June 2016~~2016~~~~0~ ~0~ ~26/03/2017 20:47:44.16000000, David Gaddes, W.

The MEM is important because it will enable the widespread adoption of microgrids, which in-turn enables the widespread adoption of distributed renewable energy resources.  This leads to environmental benefits and reduced energy costs to consumers and businesses. The AIR-TT project will result in a field-tested MEM that will be ready for commercial adoption by energy service and integration companies. MEM has the following unique features: (a) wireless operation; (b) smart user-interfaces; (c) low power consumption; (d) internet of things; and (e) cloud computing. Together, these features will remove the hassle for the energy users from having to frequently negotiate the nuances of microgrids, and will provide a consumer experience wherein intelligent control with smart phone and/or web interfaces become useful for realizing reduced energy costs and improving end-use comfort simultaneously.

This project addresses the following key technology gap while translating the research discovery into commercial applications. The gap is a lack of design-oriented models that predict system-level interactions among power networks, wireless networks, embedded computing devices and cloud systems when they are deployed together. This project helps address this key technology gap by (a) building a definitive test-bed; (b) field-deploying the test beds to obtain performance data and (c) empirically identifying and refining design-oriented models. 

In addition, personnel involved in this project, including undergraduate and graduate students from engineering and business schools, will receive course-work and project-based learning in the areas of entrepreneurship and technology translation through (a) interdisciplinary special topics courses (b) the Wisconsin Entrepreneurship Bootcamp (c) the business plan competitions such as the Wisconsin Energy and Sustainability Challenge, and (d) various fieldwork demonstrations.

Any significant reduction in urban CO2 emissions will have to include a reduction in electricity footprint. Widespread adoption of wind and distributed solar generation and carbon-free base-load generation has the potential to eliminate this footprint. The technical viability of microgrids for physical realization of such systems have been demonstrated in laboratory and captive field settings. However, these technologies are not yet practical in the hands of the consumers. The transformation cannot occur without a serious change in consumer experience with electricity in terms of what electricity is used for, when it is used, and how it is paid for. At present, consumer interactions with electrical systems are active (such as turning lights on and off), or passive (such as climate control systems), with a bill served at the end of each month. We have created a platform to provide energy aware consumer experience wherein information interfaces such as mobile phone and/or web interfaces are used for monitoring and control of electrical devices.

Project: PIs Giri Venkataramanan and Suman Banerjee have previoulsy developed approaches for using wireless networks for reducing energy use in buildings under NSF?s Sustainable Energy Pathways (SEP) Program under the grant CHE-1230751. In the previous parent project, they have developed laboratory prototype demonstration hardware and software that use various wireless technologies for communicating among electrical power devices (source, loads), and cloud computing for strategizing the control of the devices. In the completed AIR-TT project, prototypes have been refined further in terms of human interfaces, networking, software and hardware, as a minimum viable product prototype that can be used in a real-world microgrid. PI Sarada Sarada is a faculty member in the Wisconsin School of Business specializing in the field of entrepreneurship. We have developed a market-ready ?MEM-in-a-box? solution that can be deployed in conjunction with commercially available communication, electrical power generation, energy storage and control devices for configuring and managing a microgrid, along with suitable embedded software applications that utilizes cloud computing for its operations.




Intellectual Merit: While the use of wireless technologies and cloud-computing in an electrical power network has been demonstrated in some lab settings, this project has addressed the challenges in scaling up device level operations to realize a complete microgrid system. Various challenges (that include (a) providing reliable communication among disparate source, storage, load and human interface devices (b) ensuring localized resilience of individual devices under intermittent and/or failed communication, and (c) ensuring stable and proper operation in light of various delays and uncontrolled latencies in communications and computing systems) have been identified and quantified to develop a robust operational system. It uses multiple modes of communications including wired Ethernet, GSM and public internet, etc, and the framework of cloud-computing with localized intelligence at each node tat provides the necessary back-bone to meet these challenges simultaneously. Participation from the PI from business school has enabled us to identify the marketplace challenges at the outset, ensuring a smooth pathway towards commercialization.

Broader Impact: Project team members have (1) offered project-oriented interdisciplinary experienes that engages engineering, computer science and business students from diverse social backgrounds to enroll together, and form teams to develop solutions relevant to this project working with the graduate student researchers in the form of a Hackathon; (2) engaged undergraduate research students from diverse backgrounds to participating in the project through an REU experience. (3) conducted student activities to take place in the UW-Madison's maker-space community to broaden the visibility of the project among the local technology-savvy and venturing public; (4) worked with the City of Madison, and Seventh Wave, (formerly Energy Center of Wisconsin) to identify field deployment opportunities of the project artifacts in energy sustainability demonstration projects; (5) conducted workshops for students on using the Microgrid Energy Manager internationally with a partner institution in India (National Institute of Engineering), and locally at UW-Madison; (6) developed network contacts with microgrids, energy management and venture capital professionals to set the stage for identifying and promoting partners for commercializing the developed technology; and (7) developed a website for assisting recruitment and dissemination of the project outcomes to broad audiences.

Project team members are currently exploring the development of two pathways in making the technology developments commercial: (1) an experimental hardware and software platgorm to serve the prototyping needs of the smart and microgrid research and educaitonal community (2) a ready to deploy platform suitable for microgrid based rural electrificaiton projects in developing economies in Africa and South Asia. Effforts are underway in moving forward in both directions.

FD technology is important because it allows wireless communication devices to receive and broadcast simultaneously, on the same frequency, thus effectively doubling spectrum utilization. The project will result in a prototype FD transceiver that can be easily integrated into current systems, leading to improved capacity and quality of service. By utilizing FD systems, spectrum assets worth billions of dollars can be redirected to create new opportunities for growth.  This FD transceiver has the following unique features: a) Fully digital signal processing, b) reduced cost and c) compact footprint. These features allow for rapid deployment of compact, low cost, FD wireless systems capable of operating at double the spectral efficiency of competing Half-Duplex systems. 

By utilizing smart training heuristics that control a beam-steerable antenna and new digital cancellation transceiver architectures, a reduction of more than 100 dB of the self-interfering signal is achievable, thus allowing for FD communication. Technology gaps between research discovery and commercial application that will be addressed include developing new heuristics that are capable of adapting to the dynamic indoor and outdoor wireless channels, as well as novel robust channel estimation and non-linearity estimation and mitigation algorithms. Finally, new interference management and avoidance techniques will be designed to enable robust FD systems. The novelty of the proposed research is that it aims to bridge the gap between theoretical performance of FD systems and practical considerations that take into account the unique features associated with FD systems.

A major shortcoming of current deployed wireless systems is the limitation to operate as half duplex systems employing either a time-division or frequency-division approach to bidirectional communication, creating an unnecessary duplication of resources.

In prior work by the PI, it was shown that using a beam steerable reconfigurable antenna in combination with analog and digital cancellation leads to robust full duplex performance with cancellations of up to 120 dB. However, performance was limited by low transmit power and a low adaptation rate to changes in the wireless channel due to excessive time invested in training the system.

The work performed in this project builds on prior work and primarily addressed two problems in Full Duplex systems. A) Enabling real time synchronization between full duplex enabled nodes under realistic conditions of high-power transmission (up to 25 dBm). B) Improving channel estimation and adaptation to support the dynamic nature of the wireless channel. Both goals were achieved and prototyped. Results were published and shared with the community via professional meetings, conference and Journal publications.

In addition to addressing the knowledge gap, the project allowed for unique opportunities to engage graduate students to understand the full cycle of research, development and potential commercialization of technology to better serve the community. Students attended meetings with academic and business leaders that were performed at the UCI Cove, which is a university sponsored incubator created with the goal of translating research from the University into the community.

The technology is based upon a novel GPS-based methodology that marries the precision found in industrial-grade methodologies with the low costs of off-the-shelf consumer-grade components. Current competing solutions (RTK, D-GPS, etc.) suffer from high cost, technical complexity, and other constraints, making them inaccessible to a large market segment of potential users. The lack of affordable and accurate solutions restricts the availability of further innovations and better product offerings by companies and developers in location-aware markets that would be otherwise inclined to use such solutions, including applications such as sports tracking, self driving cars, drones, and do-it-yourself land surveying. Successful completion of this project will result in a robust and scalable prototype, providing accuracies approaching those of professional-grade positioning in a viable consumer-grade price range. This will enable further innovation in this field, and it may lead to new application areas that have not yet been conceived due to limitations of the current state of the art.

The project addresses a number of known technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application, including 1) developing a novel approach for combining inertial and GPS measurements without a stationary calibration phase, 2) making the technology robust in challenging GPS environments such as dense urban areas and forests, and 3) devising a new approach to ""Localization as a Service"" by integrating the algorithms in a scalable cloud platform, utilizing a potentially crowd-sourced network of low-cost base stations for increased robustness and accuracy.  Some of these contributions are novel research areas themselves and some are based on known techniques, but each one is made possible due to the interplay between the contributions as a whole and the basic GPS-based localization research upon which this translation project is built. The result of overcoming these technical hurdles and integrating them into a cloud-based platform will be an easy-to-use, low-complexity localization service that can provide professional-grade accuracies at a fraction of the cost of existing commercial solutions.

In addition to producing an industrial-grade prototype, the team members involved in this project, including a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student, will receive invaluable entrepreneurial and academia-to-industry technology translation experiences, not only through continued interactions with potential customers, but also by navigating the business and legal landscape of licensing the existing IP from Vanderbilt University, developing strategic partnerships with businesses who desire to integrate this product into their own, and learning how to best utilize the resources available, both from academia and from industry.",,,"Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), provide ubiquitous outdoor device localization. Currently, low-cost devices only provide estimates on the order of meters. However, the ability to share GNSS measurements between nodes, coupled with the unique constraints of the GNSS positioning domain, offer novel opportunities for low-cost, high accuracy relative positioning. This research investigated such opportunities in order to create a robust, accurate, and economical positioning platform and to begin commercialization of the technology.  The most important research result has been the development of a novel tracking method where the relative positions of multiple receivers can be tracked very precisely. If one of these nodes is at a known location, then the approach becomes absolute positioning. That is, it provides the location of all nodes in absolute Earth coordinates just like regular GPS does but at a higher accuracy. The tracking algorithm relies on knowing the initial locations of the nodes. Much of our research focused on devising a solution to this problem that is just as precise as the tracking itself. We have been able to solve this problem for most environments except for the most challenging ones such as urban canyons and dense forests. Under these tough conditions our solution is no better than traditional GPS techniques. To commercialize the results and to continue refine the technology beyond the project, we created a startup company called Fazecast Inc. The company discussed the technology with various other companies in a variety of industries, but so far none these potential opportunities have panned out. Just like many startups, Fazecast pivoted when a related but different market opportunity presented itself. The company created and patented an acoustic gunshot detection and localization system for law enforcement use and licensed it to a security vendor called V5 Systems. The V5 portable security camera with the integrated gunshot detector hit the market in 2017.

Three quarters of the earth surface is covered with water that overlays many resources upon which our lives depend. High speed wireless underwater data communication among underwater sensors, deepwater instruments and autonomous underwater vehicles is of high importance in many applications of national interest, such as environmental ocean monitoring to predict natural disasters such as hurricanes, and offshore oil and gas drilling. However, underwater channels are highly bandlimited and the data rates of existing modems are much smaller than what is needed for effective communication and management. The project will result in a prototype underwater modem that benefits from novel vector acoustic underwater communication concepts and methods. This underwater vector modem has the unique feature of utilizing acoustic particle velocity channels for data communication, in addition to the conventional acoustic pressure channel. This feature provides the following advantages: increased data rate, improved performance, and small size modems, when compared to the leading competing underwater modems in this market space.

This project addresses a number of technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. In the new vector acoustic and particle velocity communication paradigm, the underwater modem designer is facing new communication channels and transducers that are fundamentally different from those used in the past. Therefore, proper designs for different parts of the modem, including transducers and analog and digital transceivers will be developed. Analog electronics are supposed to interface with multi-channel transducers, whereas digital signal processing units are required to generate and demodulate multiple data streams. The personnel involved in this project, graduate and undergraduate students, will receive innovation, entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through working at the interface of multiple disciplines such as electro-acoustic transducers, underwater acoustics, communication and signal processing hardware/software, as well as participating in an intensive boot-camp on technology entrepreneurship.

The project engages Teledyne-Benthos and Kongsberg, two leading companies whose underwater modems and autonomous underwater vehicles are sold worldwide, to assist in at-sea testing of the prototype modem developed in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality. Development of the vector acoustic high speed modem prototype will eventually allow the growth of many underwater systems and businesses whose operations have been constrained by low wireless data rates or very expensive undersea cables.",,,,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

The Video Collaboratory is important because increasingly huge amounts of video are being generated for business and personal use. And while there are currently ways to distribute / watch video, it is still not easy to drill into, analyze, and note important details from within the video as a means to an end, particularly when working with others. From corporate training to healthcare, education, and security, people need effective ways to privately converse about, mark up and brainstorm around videos that are linked directly into the video content itself. The project will result in a scaled-up and enhanced Video Collaboratory platform with the following unique features: new ways for precision interaction with video documents, direct connection of group discussions to the video timeline, and private social networking to support meaningful work with videos. These features provide the following advantages: enabling clearer, deeper discussion; reducing error and confusion; and increasing efficiency / saving time when compared to the leading competing technologies in this market space, such as YouTube and Vimeo, that focus on distribution rather than detailed analysis and use of video documents. This project will develop a market-ready technology platform for next-generation collaboration around video data.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: (1) social presence affordances and group analytics to enable group-guided viewing and synchronous interaction around video documents; (2) rich communication pathways to support multimedia annotations and video-centric filtering of commentary as part of video-anchored discussion; (3) responsive components for interface and video data to scale across platforms (particularly mobile) with smart video streaming that adapts to user network environments; and (4) elastic, scalable, and socially-aware metrics for group/project organization, access/privacy control, and content management for sharing. Significant contributions to the research and knowledge base are novel techniques designed to address these gaps, validated through user study testing. Contributions include techniques for synchronous interaction around video documents; social discussion threading (integrating context from annotated video segmentation, user interaction analytics, and discussion content); weighted adaptive video streaming to prioritize transfer of content by discussion activity; and a flexible, socially-aware model for access management and content sharing. In addition, personnel involved in this project, graduate students and post-docs, will receive technology translation and entrepreneurship experiences through research development and discovery toward commercial reality.","Jinyue Xia and David C.

It provides specialized interactions / tools to enhance and optimize collaborative use of video material in different task contexts, such as instructor-student interaction around learning materials and assessment of performance in recorded training scenarios. The platform was initially developed as part of fundamental research in a previous NSF project. This technology transfer project addressed next stage technology and knowledge gaps to advance the platform from academic research discovery toward a commercially viable platform that will make the research results widely available for use in practice.

 The project successfully developed, tested, and refined new versions of the platform to address next stage technology and knowledge gaps in: (1) social presence and group analytics; (2) enhanced communication pathways with contextualized and multi-modal annotations; (3) responsive components to scale across mobile and desktop platforms; and (4) flexible, socially-aware metrics for content management. Research developments and outcomes were tested with hundreds of users across a variety of different task domains in order to verify usefulness and scalability. Project results have successfully met the goals of the program and advanced the technology from its initial research stage to a point where the technology is set to be adopted by a company for commercialization of the research.

The project provided significant training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student project team members, as well as a postdoctoral researcher. This included 3 students through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, one master?s level graduate researcher, and one PhD researcher with project work as a significant component of the completed dissertation. Students engaged with project investigators for one-on-one mentoring and gained project experience in career counseling, training in research, instruction in professional practice, participation in opportunities to publish research and opportunities to experience the business aspects of commercializing technology. A number of further academic research publications are in preparation or under review and are expected to be published over the next year.

The Video Collaboratory platform is expected to have significant broader impacts on pedagogical methods and training through support for team based collaboration. With video becoming an essential classroom and workplace communication medium and collaborators being increasingly distributed, there is demand for a software platform that permits clear and specific discussion around the information embedded in video documents. The platform enables users to interact collaboratively around video content in a way that is efficient, but still allows users to have as much detailed discussion as is needed. By providing new modes of collaborative interaction around video documents, the Video Collaboratory platform will enable new human resource pathways, such as remote training, evaluation, and certification in performance based tasks where asynchronous feedback on video recordings can complement in-person interactions.

The motionless MSM micropump is important because it enables dosage of micro fluids at higher precision and greater reliability which will advance research in many areas of biology, chemistry, and medicine.  For instance the motionless MSM micropump will drain fluids from organs such as brain and lung continuously without or with minimally invasive surgery as opposed to removal of such fluids through repeated surgical interventions which is the current state of the art. The project will result in a scalable prototype of a motionless MSM micropump. This motionless MSM micropump has the following unique features: it is lightweight, actuated contact-free, and can transport a large range of volumes from picoliter to milliliter. These features provide advantages such as reliability, precision, versatility, contact-free actuation, low power consumption when compared to the leading competing peristaltic pumps and syringe pumps in this market space.  

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The MSM pumping concept was demonstrated in 2012 at a pump actuated by a rotating permanent magnet. The micropump makes use of a magnetic shape memory alloy that shape-shifts in response to a dynamic magnetic field. Researchers will replace the rotating magnet with a set of electrical coils and a yoke turning the pump into a solid state device without moving parts. This will simplify the design, enable further miniaturization, and reduce weight. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a post-doctoral engineering researcher and a MBA student, will receive experiences in innovation, product development and technology translation through combining a multifunctional, magneto-mechanical, smart material with electromagnetic field manipulation and through using a customer development process - namely the Lean Launchpad process - to build a sustainable business model around the motionless MSM micropump.

The project engages the animal hospital WestVet to establish clinical needs for a micropump in context with bodily fluid drainage in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality. The project also engages Idaho TechHelp to connect the researchers with manufacturers in Idaho and the region.","Zhang, Hu and Armstrong, Andrew and M?llner, Peter~Effects of surface modifications on the fatigue life of unconstrained Ni-Mn-Ga single crystals in a rotating magnetic field~Acta Materialia~155~2018~~~10.1016/j.actamat.2018.05.070~10092468~175 to 186~10092468~OSTI~29/04/2019 21:02:02.620000000",,"Drs. Peter Mullner and Kent Neupert and their team including a staff scientist, a materials science and engineering graduate student, two MBA students, and seven engineering undergraduate students developed a micropump based on magnetic shape memory technology and discovered the market for such a device.

The initial market that was targeted for the MSM micropump was the veterinary market. MBA student Runyan and MSE graduate student Armstrong attended the Western Veterinary Conference in Las Vegas, NV on March 7-9, 2016 and the Experimental Biology Conference in San Diego, CA on April 3-5, 2016 to test the market hypothesis. Runyan and Armstrong interviewed twenty six researchers in the areas of biomolecular, biomedical, and veterinary research.

The results of the market analysis are as follows. Micropumps are extensively used in microfluidics and their application is growing fast in the healthcare industry. There is a potential need of micropumps which can deliver precise flow rate with high accuracy. The MSM micropump can satisfy these requirements. The possible application of MSM Micropump in the healthcare industry are potentially vast and can create an opportunity for significant growth. The key applications in the healthcare market will be diabetes, drug delivery, pain management, spasticity, and neurological disorders. On the other hand, potential application area in analytical instrument market will be flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), micro total chemical analysis systems (&micro;TAS), and coulter counter.   Based on the market research, these areas offer the greatest potential.

To address market specific needs such as crossing the blood-brain barrier, the team redesigned the MSM micropump. The team also built a pump testing station to characterize the pump performance. The MSM micropump delivered water successfully against a pressure of 700 mbar which is about ten times better than competing technology, and sufficient to traverse the blood-brain barrier.

The technical team further developed a surface treatment method which they call micro-peening. They built a device that ejects very small (20 micrometer) glass beads onto the MSM transducer with an air stream at a pressure of 1-6 bars. Preliminary experiments showed that micro-peening increases the useful life of an MSM actuated device by one thousand times. In a rotating magnetic field, untreated samples developed cracks within about two hundred actuation cycles. In contrast, samples that were treated on two opposing sites did not show cracks after two hundred thousand actuation cycles, and demonstrated full integrity after one million actuation cycles. Through the actuation life, the MSM sample demonstrated full actuation functionality.

The researchers further developed a surface profile characterization instrument. The instrument permits analyzing the MSM actuation mechanism in situ, which is instrumental for the optimization of the MSM pumping mechanism to further enhance the pumping performance (i.e. increasing the back pressure and the useful actuation life).

Within the broader scope of integrated circuitry, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters are the subject of this activity. High temperature SiC analog-to-digital data converters (SiC ADCs) are important because they can reside within an internal combustion engine or electric vehicle engine and convert analog sensor data to a digital form before transmission to the vehicle?s control computer. This will have the impact of increasing data rates, improving signal integrity, reducing shielding requirements on cabling, and enabling the potential for wireless transmission of data in the future. The project will result in a prototype of a SiC-based data acquisition system (DAQ) for extreme environment applications utilizing SiC ADCs. The SiC DAQ system has the main unique feature that it can survive very high temperatures (> 300?C). This provides the advantage of being able to sense and convert key data parameters in-situ at temperatures exceeding 300?C, a capability not currently available, which will improve the reliability and fuel efficiency for all types of vehicles (planes, trains, automobiles).  

The design and manufacture of SiC materials for uses outside of simple power devices requires new design for manufacturing (DFM) techniques. This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery towards commercial application:  1) to understand and mitigate the manufacturing variability of SiC-CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor); and 2) to qualify the reliability of a full-scale component. To do this, the team will assemble a demonstration unit that has sufficient capability to illustrate the potential for the technology while being sufficiently simple to support extensive test and characterization for reliability in a real world application. In addition, personnel involved in this project, masters and doctoral students in electrical engineering, will receive first-hand technology translation experience through the design activities undertaken that proceed from the feasibility to prototype phase with serious consideration of the eventual product.

The project engages Ozark Integrated Circuits of Fayetteville, Arkansas in guiding the commercialization aspects of the technology as it transitions from feasibility proof to prototype in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.","S.

Conventional system designs would require bulky and expensive cooling systems to achieve reliable operation of the circuits in the systems. Alternatively, there are materials such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) which can be used to fabricate discrete circuits and even entire systems which can operate at temperatures in excess of 300 &deg;C. Areas such as industrial control, power generation, aerospace, and automotive electronics could be greatly advanced by the development of such technology. This project saw the successful design of a SiC data acquisition (DAQ) system which combined multiple circuits which have been tested at extreme temperatures. While the system would be useful in a variety of applications, a prototype was tested with a UV sensor to collect data from combustion diesel engines which has large implications for the advancement of the automotive industry. If the performance of an engine can be monitored in real-time, steps can be taken to improve its performance and efficiency.

The project capitalized on previous successes in designing building block integrated circuits in silicon carbide. The logical next step was to design a system which combined multiple circuits. A crucial part of many applications is the ability to take and then transmit data which can be read and analyzed in order to improve functionality of the system. In high temperature applications some components of the data acquisition system may have to be located some distance from the sources of the sensed data in order to operate at a lower temperature. With an all-SiC DAQ, the quality and reliability of the data can be improved by moving the circuitry closer to the source. In the example of a diesel engine, the sensor and DAQ can be located very close to the combustion site which provides more accurate data. This increase in reliability and fidelity would not only improve the automotive industry but would also provide for great gains in other high temperature applications as well.

The DAQ prototype was built and each of the SiC components were tested at temperatures of 400 &deg;C or greater. The entire system was tested in the lab, but it was also successfully tested with data taken from an actual diesel engine using a SiC UV sensor. The system consisted of multiple SiC circuits which can be combined in the future into a single system on a chip. The data was sensed, amplified, converted into digital data and transmitted in a common data protocol, all using silicon carbide circuits. This makes for a large step toward reliable high-temperature real-time measurement capabilities.

This project also provided for the opportunity for undergraduate as well as graduate students to work with industry professionals. Professional engineers provided training for students from a variety of backgrounds while getting the chance to move an important technology closer towards a commercial product. These interactions will pay off in the future of those students? careers, the development of the research laboratory and the success of the industry partner. A student connected with this project was hired by the commercial partner. Overall, this project resulted in technology which will benefit a variety of extreme environment fields and developed new engineers with increased knowledge of how to solve relevant problems in our society.

This will enable physicians to quickly and accurately extract complex patient data from all relevant biomedical images, (e.g., CT scans with hundreds of image slices) trauma scores, diagnoses, treatments, demographics, and injury specifics for each patient?while integrating and analyzing the information to generate prediction, warning, and treatment recommendations at every stage of patient care. This project is important not only to help decrease medical complications and increase survival, but also to optimize resource utilization- a key to reducing the  approximately $60B medical cost each year for treating complications in pelvic and abdominal trauma cases. 

The Traumatic Pelvic and Abdominal Injury DSS technology has the following unique capabilities which provide competitive advantages when compared to the existing state of the art for DSS tools: 1) it segments and assesses damage to major abdominal organs; 2) it provides recommendations and predictions for several specific, complex clinical decisions; 3) it is fully automated and does not require an expert?s supervision in analyzing patient data- providing an easier-to-use software interface and potentially providing higher accuracy in pertinent recommendations for trauma patient care. If the algorithms and software are successfully validated through this project, a licensing pathway has been identified to commercialize the DSS software.

Clinical decision making shows its true complexity when one is trying to quickly and accurately integrate complex types of patient data in an emergency setting. This project addresses several technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Existing ""semi-automated"" systems use only a portion of patient data and do not analyze detailed information contained in digital images to create recommendations; conversely, current image processing technologies designed mainly to assist in analysis of CTs (or other images) are not optimized to address the needs of trauma and/or DSS tools. This project will refine and scale up the prototype, validate its clinical use, and accelerate its commercialization to assist clinicians in traumatic pelvic and abdominal injury cases. Key technical objectives are to: 1) expand the organ segmentation software module (now covering only the spleen) to include the liver, kidneys, and pancreas; 2) enhance the hemorrhage detection algorithms to find bleeding close to bones; 3) further validate and improve the system using a larger and more comprehensive dataset; and 4) rewrite the graphical user interface to match requirements for the prototype and validate its effectiveness and ease of use by clinicians. Key computational methods generated by this project include automated image processing algorithms and machine learning methods to: 1) assess a CT scan for bone fracture(s) and hemorrhage and measure their sizes; 2) segment more major organs, identify damage, and quantitatively assess level of injury; and 3) predict outcomes (survival, number of ICU days, home vs. rehab, etc.) and form recommendations for care givers at each step of the treatment. The graduate student involved in this project will gain experience in innovation and technology translation towards commercialization through development of the DDS tool, testing and validating the algorithms, and working closing with the project team, clinicians, business developers, tech transfer professionals, and a potential licensee to commercialize the technology as a viable product.","Negar Farzaneh, S.M.Reza Soroushmehr, Hirenkumar Pate, Alexander Wood, Jonathan Gryak, David Fessell, and Kayvan Najarian~Automated Kidney Segmentation for Traumatic Injured Patients through Ensemble Learning and Active Contour Modeling~40th International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society~~2018~~~~0~ ~0~ ~04/03/2019 15:47:34.316000000, Negar Farzaneh, Samuel Habbo-Gavin, S.Reza Soroushmehr, Hirenkumar Patel, David P.

Recent studies show that while misdiagnosis rate of multiple trauma is at 16.19%, limbs and pelvis are misdiagnosed at 39.50%, and abdominal region and pelvic organ are at 19.55%. The annual cost of trauma approaching is estimated at $260 billion, empahsizing the need for optimal resource utilization as a key factor inreducing the cost. The mortality rate of patients with pelvic injuries is increased by the risk of further complications, key amongst which is severe hemorrhage. For patients who are hemorrhaging, prompt and appropriate treatment of pelvic injury is crucial for the patient?s survival. This project focused on desinning and tesing of a computer assisted decision making system capable of rapidly analyzing large volumes of patient information to generate accurate treatment recommendations and outcome predictions has the potential to improve both patient care and resource utilization. In collaboration with industry partners, the project started from a proof-of-concept solution to a prototype of a computer-aided trauma decision making software.

Among all the medical data available for clinical decision making, information contained in the pelvic and abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) is highly important for both assessment of the severity and prognosis of such injuries. However, each pelvic and abdominal CT scan includes a large number of slices (typically a few hundred) and each slice contains a large number of pixel information that may not be thoroughly assessed and/or analyzed by simple visual inspection. Combing information from CT-scans along with information from other sources such as patient demographic information, can be extremely useful in the decision making process. Therefore, to be able to assess severity, determine prognosis and develop effective treatment plans using all available information in a timely manner can be made possible with a computer-assisted pelvic and abdominal trauma decision making system.

 

This technology developed by this project was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation. The capability of this system is as follows;

The system processes patient CT slices using advanced and effective image processing methods to extract clinically important features to determine the existence and severity of both bone fractures and hematoma in abdominal and head regions.
Furthermore, the system incorporates complex machine learning techniques to combine the computed features from CT data along with patient?s other medical data and demographics in order to form predictions and recommendations to assist physicians and other care givers in forming more informed diagnostic decisions.

The laser-based methane sensor for small unmanned aerial systems is important because it will result in increased safety by preventing explosions, improve the environment through reduced emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and increase profits in the gas/oil sector through more product reaching their customers. The project will result in a prototype methane sensor for small unmanned aerial vehicles, which are rapidly increasing in their use and applications. No existing commercial methane sensors are sufficiently small, lightweight, and sensitive to be deployed on small unmanned aerial systems (those with wing spans of about a meter) for natural gas leak detection. The laser-based methane sensor has the following unique features: low mass (1 kg), small volume (1 L volume), fast response (10 measurements per second) and high-precision (2 parts per billion methane). These features will allow for efficient natural gas leak detection through decreased operating costs, increased safety of operation in populated areas, and more accurate leak identification when compared to the current method of visual, manned-aircraft patrols.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The project synthesizes two rapidly developing technologies, mid-infrared laser spectroscopy and small unmanned aerial systems, and capitalizes upon their desirable attributes of high sensitivity detection and high-dexterity sampling, respectively. A newly-developed, interband cascade laser (ICL) operating at a wavelength of 3.3 microns will be used to probe the strongest (fundamental) absorption band of methane to achieve the necessary sensitivity. The ICL will be coupled into an optical cavity and integrated onto a small unmanned aerial system. The sensor will be exposed directly to the free airstream and not require any sample cells, inlets, or manifolds, thereby reducing size and mass. Sensor accuracy, particularly critical during the wide range of atmospheric conditions and vibrations experienced in-flight, will be maintained through the use of an in-line reference cell with multiharmonic wavelength modulation spectroscopy. Sensor flight performance will be verified with controlled releases of methane, and flight demonstrations over pipelines will be conducted. In addition, key personnel involved in this project, a graduate student, will receive entrepreneurial experiences and see how laboratory discoveries are translated into commercial products through working with operators in the drone and gas/oil industries.

The project engages a leading small unmanned aerial systems service provider to test and demonstrate the new sensors to its clients in the gas/oil industry at FAA-approved locations and operations. The technology will improve pipeline monitoring in specific and other trace gas detection in general in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.","L.M.

Previous research has found Micro-LAM to be essential in machining materials that are very hard and extremely brittle (e.g. semiconductors and ceramics). The Micro-LAM process modifies the material, in-situ during machining, so as to render these materials easier to cut and makes it more cost effective to generate useful end products.  The Micro-LAD system aims to achieve enhanced ductility through reduced hardness and decreased brittleness from laser heating and thermal softening, which promotes a more efficient, productive and less costly manufacturing process.  This research project aims to evaluate the Micro-LAD system that capitalizes on this fundamental material behavior and determines the degree and significance of the preferential heating and resultant thermal softening of the high-pressure phases of semiconductors and ceramics during the machining process.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as the technology translates from research discovery toward commercial application: improve the productivity and decrease the cost of drilling semiconductors and ceramics by extending the Micro-LAM technology to drilling with a proof of concept and performing a market analysis.   By advancing the capability associated with drilling semiconductors and ceramics by locally rendering them more ductile and less brittle, it will become easier to machine, resulting in greater productivity and reduced cost of manufacture when compared to the current drilling process in the marketplace. This new knowledge and expertise can be assimilated into teaching and educational efforts, as well as distributed into industry.

Overall, the project will produce achievement in four core areas.  First, fundamental materials science and engineering research will be advanced and showcased in a real proof of concept.  Second, the principal investigators will work with the university?s technology transfer office and industrial partners to further integrate the research results into realizable structures, initially the proposed proof of concept and eventually a prototype and commercialization or production unit. Third, a business model or plan will be developed to engage industries? interests and for market research activities associated with the proposed research. Finally, students will achieve unique education and research experiences directly related to product innovation and the process of moving fundamental research into real world commercial use.

Partners at the inception of the project include both academic and industry organizations: Western Michigan University (Kalamazoo, Michigan) and Micro-LAM Technologies LLC (Battle Creek, Michigan).

This capability will positively impact many science & engineering disciplines, government, defense, commercial companies, and non-profit organizations.

During the course of the project, our work focused on addressing the following technology gaps that were important on the road of translating our research discovery toward a commercially-viable product. We expanded the features from the MPI specification that are efficiently supported by BDMPI. We developed new mechanisms by which data transparently migrates between disk and memory that is compatible with BDMPI?s way of scheduling the computations and leads to substantial performance improvements. We developed new task scheduling mechanisms that lead to a more uniform distribution of the computations across the processors, resulting in faster execution time. Finally, we extended BDMPI to support multi-threaded processing within each of its processes, so that to support shared-memory/distributed-memory applications.

In addition, the project contributed to the training of the graduated students that were directly supported by it in the areas of high-performance computing, distributed systems, and scientific computing, as well as in the areas of innovation, entrepreneurship, technology commercialization, and IP protection. The students attended NSF sponsored meetings and workshops on these topics and also seminars on the issues, challenges, and approaches for starting up a company.

Delivery of nucleic acids into cells can be used as a method to treat certain diseases or study natural cell behavior.  This innovation, entitled GeneTrain, is important because existing chemicals that facilitate the delivery of nucleic acids into cells, known as transfection reagents, are effective with only certain types of cells.  The technology proposed here will enable researchers to perform nucleic acid delivery experiments across many different types of cells thereby expediting and expanding the discovery of new siRNA or DNA-based therapies.  In addition, such a robust research tool will allow scientists to accelerate biomedical research en route to a deeper understanding of diseases.  This product has the following unique features: the novel design and application of an engineered protein bearing a highly positive charge for binding to negatively charged nucleic acid, resulting in efficient delivery of siRNA and plasmid DNA, as well as uniform effectiveness across a broad range of cell types.  These features provide the end user and customer with a solution that fulfills a wide spectrum of experimental requirements, removing the necessity to use multiple reagents or spend countless hours optimizing cell culture conditions when compared to conventional methods.

The project will result in a prototype of GeneTrain and addresses technology gaps of formulation optimization and cell line/competitor benchmarking, which both vastly hinder the commercialization progress of this innovation.  The initial data, while promising, suggests that the level limits of formulation factors (engineered protein-lipid compositional ratios) have not yet been adequately probed so as to yield optimal effects on transfection efficiency.

The genetic material can either be plasmid DNA, which results in a translated protein or short interfering RNA, or simply siRNA, which results in abolishment of an existing gene within the cell. Depending on which genetic material a researcher chooses to work with, the actual process of transfection involves the following steps:

 

1)         The plasmid DNA or siRNA is delivered past the cell membrane;

2)         The plasmid DNA is translated into a functional protein

Or

                        The siRNA latches onto a gene of interest preventing translation;

3)         The protein resulting from the plasmid DNA yields a measurable response

 Or

            The lack of protein resulting from siRNA yields a measurable response

 

Transfection reagents are chemicals, predominantly lipid in character, that aid in the delivery of either plasmid DNA or siRNA along each of the aforementioned steps. A reagents performance is often called ""transfection efficiency"" as this term succinctly summarizes the successful completion of the whole process. While there are around a dozen transfection reagents on the approximately $150 million market, many of these reagents fail to meet the high standards of molecular biologists, i.e. high transfection efficiency with low toxicity to the cells. Furthermore, the human body is composed of over 200 different healthy cell types and some cells, particularly stem cells or immune cells, are resistant to transfection.

 

Our research was focused on production of a prototype transfection reagent centered around our core technology: an engineered protein that binds to plasmid DNA and siRNA. This binding event occurs because the protein was rationally designed to exhibit a highly positive charge on the surface of the protein via genetic engineering. The positively charged protein surface is highly attracted to the negative charge inherent to either plasmid DNA or siRNA. When this engineered protein is combined with other commercially available transfection reagents along with siRNA or plasmid DNA, the transfection efficiencies are anywhere between 4 and 8-fold greater than the commercial reagent alone.  These results drove us to seek an application for this protein beyond our own personal uses.

While conducting market analyses and carrying out customer discovery correspondence with end-users and manufacturers alike, we found an omnipresent need for a transfection reagent that can transfect all cell types while maintaining low cellular toxicity. Our intention was to use this core technology, the engineered protein, in conjunction with novel lipid reagents of our design to produce a transfection reagent, tentatively called Gene Train, that meets the needs of molecular biologists. Our analysis of the market along with our own experiences drove us to benchmark Gene Train with the gold-standard transfection reagents across a diverse collection of the most widely used cell types. We produced meaningful results which have pushed our research in new directions.

 

As a burgeoning transfection reagent manufacturer, we found that plasmid DNA transfection can be tuned positively or negatively depending on the engineered protein combined with different novel lipid formulations. These results along with our exploratory results where the protein was combined with other transfection reagents give credence to the potential use of the protein as an adjuvant-like chemical for molecular biologists requiring a boost in transfection efficiencies for their experiments. While a market for this protein is not appealing to potential investors, we are exploring potential industry partnerships to further develop the transfection adjuvant.

The amplified bioelectronic sensor platform being developed is important because it offers an unprecedented combination of performance properties, versatility, and customizability. By varying the architecture and recognition molecules in the sensing interface, a broad range of commercially important biosensor systems could be developed for applications including screening for therapeutic agents, measurement of toxins and pathogens in food and environmental samples, point-of-care testing of biological samples, and real-time, on-site detection of chemical warfare agents for military and homeland-security applications. The project will result in prototype amplified bioelectronic sensors suitable for three types of commercial biosensor systems: portable point-of-care meters, electrochemical multiwell plates, and flow-injection analyzers. This patented bioelectronic sensor platform has the following features: (1) multiple signal-amplification mechanisms, (2) multiple types of biological recognition molecules, (3) compatibility with multiple commercial biosensor systems, and (4) disposable sensing units. These features provide the following advantages: enhanced sensitivity, versatility, user-friendliness, convenience, and cost-effectiveness when compared to the leading competing biosensor technologies in this market space.  

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Commercial biosensors are needed to measure organophosphate (OP) compounds that target the human enzyme neuropathy target esterase (NTE) and lead to catastrophic neurological disorders. Such biosensors would need to measure NTE activity rapidly and sensitively. The patented amplified bioelectronic sensor achieves this goal by using a reaction pathway to convert NTE?s esterase activity into an electronic signal and using a redox cycle to amplify the signal. However, technology gaps must be addressed to adapt the bioelectronic sensor interface to widely used commercial biosensor systems and to extend the underlying molecular sensing mechanisms to a wide range of other important compounds. These technology gaps will be addressed by (1) exploiting an enzyme-antibody linkage that translates antibody-antigen binding events into a chemical reaction flux, (2) integrating a redox cycle that converts the chemical reaction flux into an electric current and simultaneously amplifies the current, and (3) incorporating conductive nanomaterials that massively increase the sensor?s signal. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a Ph.D. student and undergraduates, will receive innovation and technology-translation experiences through participation in virtually all aspects of the research, including entrepreneurial/innovation discussions and activities. The PI will also provide training in entrepreneurship/innovation to students taking the Multidisciplinary Bioprocessing Laboratory (MBL) course he developed with NSF funding. The MBL course incorporates research into education and teaches students from multiple departments to work effectively in multidisciplinary research teams. 

The project engages Conductive Technologies, Inc., a leader in developing and manufacturing electrochemical devices for sensing commercially important analytes, to support the research effort by providing technical expertise in designing and developing electrochemical platforms as well as providing samples of printed electrodes to demonstrate biosensor performance. The project also engages MSU Technologies, the intellectual-property unit of Michigan State University, to help guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.",,,"The overall goal of this project was to translate previous NSF-funded research that resulted in a patented enzyme-based electrochemical biosensor technology into market-valued biosensor systems. The original technology provided a rapid and sensitive method to detect dangerous chemical agents that interfere with the human nervous system. The approach involved immobilizing an enzyme from the human nervous system into an electrochemical biosensor. This enzyme?s activity integrated of a chemical reaction pathway that generated an electric current and included a redox-cycling loop that amplified the current. If a neurotoxic chemical agent (e.g., a nerve gas) were introduced, the biosensor?s electrical output signal would drop substantially within a few seconds.

 

In this project, the advantages of the original electrochemical biosensor (high sensitivity and a quantitative electrical output) were combined with the advantages of commercial antibody-based assays (extremely high selectivity) to give a hybrid Enzyme Electrochemical Immunoassay Biosensors (EEIB). Because antibodies are commercially available for a wide range of chemical and biological agents, EEIB could be developed for many commercial applications.  In addition, well-established methods for miniaturizing and mass-producing electrochemical biosensors (e.g., glucose biosensors for diabetics) suggest that EEIB could be mass-produced as inexpensive, disposable biosensors that could be used virtually anywhere. 

 

The technical merit of this project included development of new technical approaches to fabricate and optimize EEIB, including methods to integrate antibodies into the electrochemical biosensor reaction pathway. To improve the long-term stability of the EEIB, one of enzymes responsible for the generating the biosensor?s electrical output, tyrosinase, was replaced with a more stable enzyme, horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In addition, to reduce the complexity of the chemical pathway that generates the biosensor?s electrical current, the pathway was reduced from three reactions catalyzed by two enzymes to one reaction catalyzed by one enzyme (HRP).

 

Methods were developed to bind antibodies for the agent to be detected onto a miniature electrode, and then achieve binding of HRP-labelled secondary antibodies to the electrode in the presence of the agent.  We also adapted our EEIB assembly methods to commercially available screen-printed-electrode (SPE) arrays. Using these approaches, we were able to manufacture miniature SPE electrode arrays that combined the advantages of antibody-based detection systems with those of enzyme-based electrochemical biosensors. Using the EEIB, we were able to detect a mouse protein with a lower detection limit of 1 ng/mL in a liquid sample. 

 

The technical merit of the project also included development of two types of mathematical models that were used to predict and optimize the EEIB?s performance. Mechanistic models were developed by deriving and solving a set of differential equations that described the rates of molecular transport processes and chemical reactions responsible for generating the biosensor?s electric current. Statistical models were also used to plan experiments and analyze the resulting data. The program Minitab was used to design a set of experiments to evaluate the effects of four key independent variables (concentrations of two reactants, pH, and electrode voltage) on the dependent variables (biosensor current and signal-to-noise ratio in the presence of the target agent). Minitab?s analysis of the experimental results yielded a statistical model that calculated the strength with which independent variable affected the biosensor?s current and identified the combination of the four independent variables that optimized the current.  Results of the mechanistic and statistical models were then compared.  The mechanistic models? predictions of how key independent variables influenced the biosensor?s current agreed with predictions of the statistical models. This result is significant, because the validated mechanistic models provide powerful tools for in-silico design of EEIB that exhibit a desired set of operating properties.    

 

This project had a broader impact via providing educational opportunities. Two female PhD students in chemical engineering were trained in this project. Also, two female undergraduate students who were trained in this project as Research Experience for Undergraduates participants were admitted into PhD programs at highly-ranked universities. The commercialization focus of this project resulted in its being assigned a team of three graduate students as part of MSU?s Spartan Innovations Fellows Program. These students assessed the project?s commercialization potential. In addition, three biomedical engineering Ph.D. students were assigned to assess health-related commercialization opportunities of EEIB technologies. The project also had a broader impact via intellectual property development. A patent application describing a novel biosensor developed as part of this project is pending.

This innovation is important as new fundamental physical effects will be applied to enable solutions not attainable with current competing technology. The project will result in new designs and prototype reflectors that will be tested in detail for operation in important frequency bands. The proposed reflectors will have the following unique features: high degree of parametric stability, large spectral bandwidth, compact size, and high-yield manufacturing. These features provide advantages including high efficiency, low loss, economy in fabrication, and robustness in applications. These single-layer devices can be fabricated on substrates or as membranes. They avoid the multiple interfaces and associated issues in commercial thin-film multilayer reflectors; thus, thermal expansion effects and adhesion problems are minimized. These reflectors can be applied in spectral regions for which the deposition of thin-film multilayers is impractical or impossible. Therefore, this innovation provides new solutions and is likely to compete effectively in a sizeable market space.  

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: (1) verification of the utility of the proposed fundamental resonance effect in this context, and (2) verification that practical prototype reflectors with high-efficiency wideband spectra can be fabricated. The proposed resonant reflectors are designed with gratings in which the grating ridges match to an identical material, thereby avoiding local reflections and phase changes. As this critical interface possesses zero refractive-index contrast, we call them ""zero-contrast gratings."" For simple gratings with two-part periods, we use numerical calculations to show that zero-contrast gratings provide extremely large flattop bandwidths and parametrically stable spectra; this project aims to demonstrate these devices experimentally. In summary, the main goals are to fabricate reflector prototypes operating in the ~1.2- to 12- micron spectral region; verify bandwidths of ~600-1100 nm with reflectance exceeding 99%; verify the predicted parametric stability; demonstrate polarized and unpolarized reflectors; and verify theoretical predictions of 99.99% reflectance for ~10- to 100-nm bandwidths. These devices are designed using powerful electromagnetic optimization algorithms, and they are made using standard nanofabrication methods including thin-film deposition, lithographic patterning, and etching. They are characterized by spectral analysis in the ~1- to 12- micron wavelength band. Hence, the project delivers compact, robust, polarized and unpolarized resonant reflectors that work within a broad spectral application space where classical methods fail to deliver effective solutions. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including undergraduate and graduate students, will receive entrepreneurial experiences, including business planning, by enrolling in ""Engineering Entrepreneurship"" that is taught by the PI on a regular basis.","Robert Magnusson and Yeong Hwan Ko~Wideband resonant metasurfaces: Role of local modes~IEEE Photonics Conference 2017~~2017~~~~0~ ~0~ ~29/10/2017 16:59:26.550000000, Robert Magnusson, Manoj Niraula, Jae W.

A key property of these devices is parametric stability enabling effective manufacturing with high yield. The reflectors are materially sparse while providing high reflectance across wide spectral, or wavelength, bands. These compact elements, made with only a single partially etched film on a substrate, complement commercial thin-film multilayer reflectors in wide application spaces while possessing properties not available with thin-film technology. Our reflectors are based on principles that are completely different from the effects governing conventional technology. Use of these new physical principles enables new advances in optical component technology useful in imaging systems, laser technology, medical instrumentation, and telecommunications. 

            Our resonant mirrors are made with periodic nanopatterns. In many applications, polarization independence is important as ordinary light, for example in vision, environmental monitoring, and astronomical imaging, is unpolarized. Two-dimensional (2D) patterning, yielding an array of nano- or microscale tiles or mesas, provides wideband polarization independence. We investigated the fundamental physics of 2D reflectors and compared with one-dimensional (1D) reflectors. There is strong correlation between the spectra of the two classes; indeed, the more complex case of 2D resonance can be fully understood in terms of 1D equivalents. The physical operation of photonic crystal slabs, a famous device class widely treated in diverse contexts, can thus be straightforwardly comprehended. Figure 1 makes this point clearly.

            Under the project is was found that the 1D polarized reflectors provide much wider high-efficiency spectral bands than 2D reflectors. Accordingly, we invented unpolarized broadband reflectors enabled by a serial arrangement of a pair of polarized subwavelength gratings. Optimized with numerical methods, the elemental gratings used in the demonstration consisted of a partially-etched crystalline-silicon film on a quartz substrate. The resulting reflectors exhibit extremely wide spectral reflection bands in one polarization. By arranging two such reflectors sequentially with orthogonal periodicities, there results an unpolarized spectral band that exceeds those of the individual polarized bands. In our experiments, we achieved reflectance exceeding 97% under unpolarized light incidence over a 500-nm-wide wavelength band. This wideband represents a ~44% fractional band in the near-infrared spectral region--a world record for this device class. Moreover, the resonant unpolarized broadband accommodates an ultra-high-reflection band spanning ~85 nm and exceeding 99.9% in efficiency. These elemental polarization-sensitive reflectors based on one-dimensional resonant gratings have simple design, robust performance, and are straightforward to fabricate. Hence, this technology is a promising alternative to traditional multilayer thin-film reflectors especially at longer wavelengths of light where multilayer deposition may be infeasible or impractical. Figure 2 shows an example of the experimental prototype, Figure 3 depicts theoretical and experimental data side-by-side, and Figure 4 shows the measured output spectral response.

            Taking the idea of serial 1D reflectors further, we fabricated numerous new prototypes and measured their performance in a multiple-module concatenation. The measured spectrum exhibits reflectance exceeding 98% spanning the wavelength range of 1200-2133 nm with bandwidth of 933 nm. This corresponds to a 56% fractional bandwidth relative to the center wavelength, another record device demonstrated under the project. Figure 5 shows the quantitative experimental performance achieved.

            Our resonant reflectors fall under the category of metamaterials--a new classification of subwavelength periodic lattices with wavelength of operation smaller than the period. Metamaterials are important as they possess properties not found in simple materials. Photonic device technology applying metamaterials supports many new and useful applications as exemplified by this project. We endeavor to clarify the fundamental physics of wideband metamaterial reflectors. In a paper under review, we show that these devices operate because of resonant leaky Bloch modes propagating in the periodic lattice. Moreover, in contrast to published literature, we demonstrate that Mie scattering in individual array particles is not a causal effect. In particular, by connecting the constituent particles by a matched sublayer and thereby destroying the Mie cavity, we find that the resonance bandwidth actually expands even though localized Mie resonances have been extinguished. This is demonstrated in Figure 6. There is no abrupt change in the reflection characteristics on addition of a sublayer to any metamaterial array consisting of discrete particles. Thus, the physics of the discrete, or Mie, and connected arrays is the same.

            The project has numerous broad outcomes. Some of those are published in the 6 journal papers, 7 conference papers, and 2 patents associated with the project. In particular, the good results found may impact development of analogous devices fabricated using traditional methods involving dielectric thin films and metals. New theoretical and physical understanding of wideband resonant metamaterial reflectors will have significant impact on this field of technology and aid in its development and deployment in industry for useful applications. The project impacted development of human resources in nanotechnology and photonics by graduating engineers with hands-on fabrication experience, solid theoretical understanding, and advanced design skill sets.

In conventional photolithography, a single wavelength (color) of light is used to expose an imageable material called a photoresist, and finer features are created by using light with a shorter wavelength. RAPID represents a new approach to photolithography in which one color of light exposes a photoresist causing a desired photoreaction that ultimately results in a developed image of a semiconductor circuit and a second color of light inhibits that exposure. This technique has been demonstrated to be able to create features that are far smaller than the wavelength of light employed. However, the underlying mechanisms of initiation and deactivation in RAPID photoresists are still poorly understood. The proposed research will elucidate the photochemistry and photophysics of RAPID and will provide the knowledge necessary to create RAPID photoresists that are suitable for the semiconductor industry. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to create photoresists that are capable of creating features of 10 nm or less with a spacing of 20 nm or less, all using visible light.

The broader impacts of this research are far reaching. The continued progress in increasing the number of transistors that can be fit into a given space on an integrated circuit, which is embodied by Moore's Law, has been a major technological and economic driver over the past five decades. However, current approaches to improving the resolution of semiconductor nanolithography involve the use of radiation or charged particles with ever shorter wavelengths, which goes hand in hand with ever-increasing technological challenges and cost. These approaches have also reached road blocks that may prove insurmountable. The ability to perform semiconductor nanolithography using visible light, which is inexpensive to generate, propagate and manipulate, could be a game changer for the semiconductor industry and could give a major boost to U.S. competitiveness in this field. However, RAPID is a disruptive technology that is vastly different from the approaches currently being pursued in the industry and requires more development before it will be given serious consideration as an alternative to these approaches. The goal of the proposed research is thus to develop RAPID materials to a state in which they are compatible with the needs of the semiconductor industry, so that the industry can further transition them from the research laboratory to the factory. The proposed research will increase the viability of both participating small businesses, Period Structures, Inc. (PSI) and Lithoguru. The proposed work will position these businesses to play a leading role in the transition of RAPID into semiconductor nanolithography and other markets. PSI will be at the forefront of tool design and development for RAPID, while Lithoguru will have developed all of the simulation tools essential for modeling virtually any industrial implementation of RAPID. The graduate students who will perform the proposed research will work hand-in-hand with PSI and Lithoguru, gaining invaluable experience not just in small business and its culture but also in moving a research-laboratory discovery toward a marketable technology. By participating in this project, they will develop broad skill sets that will benefit their careers and will put them in a unique position to facilitate the ensuing transition of RAPID into the foundry or to develop tools and materials with further advanced capabilities.

Although it has held for decades, Moore's Law is now failing. One reason for this breakdown is that the path to placing more circuit elements in a given area has relied on the use of ever more energetic radiation (i.e., x-rays), which has led to difficulties that are highly challening to overcome, and may even be insurmountable. A number of years ago, we developed an entirely new approach to making small features using light that relies on using two colors of visble light (which is not highly energetic). The goal of this project was to translate this technology from the small-area patterning used in the research laboratory to the large-scale patterning needed in the semiconductor industry. Meeting this goal requires both new materials and new methods. To attack this problem  the group of the PI and the University of Maryland, where this 2-color technology was first developed, joined forces with two small companies. Periodic Structures, Inc. has developed the hardware approaches for accomplishing large-area patterning with 2-color materials, and Lithoguru has developed the first predictive models of the action of these materials. Our team has greatly advanced the materials and methods for 2-color lithography, by determining how to make these materials compatible with the processes and needs of industry. We have made major discoveries regarding the mechanisms of action of 2-color materials that have allowed us to develop entirely new classes of materials and new processes for depositing and patterning them. We have also laid the groundwork for the next generation of materials, which will involve exposure to 3 colors of light rather than 2, and promises to meet the patterning needs of the semiconductor industry. The ultimate outcome of this work could be the extension of Moore's Law for many more years, allowing industry to continue creating electronic devices with ever greater functionality that will have impact throughout virtually every aspect of our society.

Currently, mussels are cultured using juveniles sourced from the wild where spatial and temporal variation in both biotic and abiotic conditions does not allow for consistent annual production schedules. Surfclams are not cultured anywhere at present, and, although present in the Gulf of Maine, are harvested commercially only in the Canadian Maritimes where they are dredged hydraulically at depths greater than 20 meters. The surfclams are flash frozen and only their feet are marketed. The proposed activities advance knowledge and understanding within the field of shellfish aquaculture involving the hatchery, nursery, and growout phases of these two commercial bivalve species that have yet to be produced in shellfish hatcheries in the U.S. The research effort will yield information critical to other researchers and commercial businesses about the parameters that affect growth and survival of each species from early to later life-history stages.

The broader impacts of this research are related to increasing U.S. competitiveness in the seafood industry. For example, since 1990, U.S. mussel imports have increased from 2,600 tons to more than 15,000 tons. Over 90% of the imports come from two countries, New Zealand and Canada, because the domestic supply is inadequate to keep up with consumer demand. Other impacts involve mentoring undergraduate students in teaching, training, and learning through hands-on hatchery and field-based activities that will broaden participation of underrepresented groups (academic and geographic). The academic-small business partnership is fundamental to the shellfish research that creates a stronger, more efficient research infrastructure. As configured, this partnerships will lead to commercialization activities that are sustainable and compatible with the cultural heritage and ecological values of downeast Maine. PI Beal (a Fulbright Scholar) and co-PI Shumway (an Aldo Leopold Fellow) have extensive experience bridging the gap between industry and academia and will be active in the project as well as in outreach activities.

Partners at the inception of the project are the lead academic institution, University of Maine at Machias, a public, undergraduate institution of 1,000 students and 100 employees in eastern Maine; and three primary, small technology-based business partners: AC,  Inc (Beals, ME), the largest wholesale seafood business in eastern Maine with 23 employees; New DHC Inc.

The effort examined the hatchery, nursery, and growout phases of both species in eastern Maine, USA (2013-2015). 

Mussels are farmed along the Maine coast, and landings in 2015 generated $2.4 million in dockside revenues.  The seed (small juveniles) that ultimately grow to become the adult mussels that are consumed in restaurants and other dining establishments are captured and collected by suspending ropes from floating work platforms with the hope that swimming, microscopic wild mussel larvae find the ropes and settle onto them.  This practice yields high spatial and temporal variation in wild seed numbers, and can only occur when mussels reproduce, which is generally over a short time during spring.  We examined methods in a hatchery setting to produce cultured seed year-round from wild-caught mussel adults and succeeded in all but two months (October and November).  We investigated a variety of microalgal diets on the growth and survival of mussel larvae and juveniles and found that mixed diets consisting of single-celled and small-chain diatoms, haptophytes, and cryptophytes work best.  Also, when larvae transition from the plankton onto ropes or other collector materials that surfaces with the highest structural complexity/greatest surface area elicit the strongest settlement responses.  In the field, cultured mussel juveniles that were attached to ropes suspended vertically in the water column grew fastest between June and August, and became larger more quickly at 5 m vs. 2 m depths.  With time and increasing size, juvenile mussels tended to drop/fall off ropes due to an apparent negative response to high intraspecific densities.  These mussels are lost to any commercial endeavor because they end up on the seafloor where they become prey to lobsters, crabs, and bottom-feeding fish.  The effect of that behavior was minimized by surrounding ropes with small-aperture, flow-through mesh or placing ropes inside small-mesh bags that caught the falling mussels. 

Arctic surfclams occur along the east coast of North America from Rhode Island to Labrador.  They are not farmed (yet), and are not commercially harvested along the Maine coast due to lack of supply, but are harvested from sandy and muddy-sand bottoms in deep water (20-50 m) in Atlantic Canada where they support a $50 million industry.  They are prized for their purple-colored foot that turns a brilliant orange/reddish color when the animal is processed or cooked.  Although most of the Canadian product fills niche markets in Asian where the foot is used as sushi or sashimi, we conducted a study to assess the market potential for Maine-grown whole Arctic surfclams (1.5- to 2-inches in shell length, SL).   Results of that assessment indicate that there is good potential to sell this size surfclam to restaurants and wholesalers in Maine at a relatively high price.  This was the first-ever attempt to complete the life-cycle of this species in a culture setting.  Larvae were reared from both wild and cultured broodstock during the grant period, and juveniles grew best in submerged, field-based nurseries from 3-12 mm SL during summer months when seawater temperatures ranged between 12-15oC. Cultured juveniles grew and survived well in nursery units without sediments.  Field experiments conducted in the lower intertidal in both sandy and muddy habitats that used animals smaller than 12 mm SL were not successful (survival rates &lt; 5% in plots designed to deter predators with small-mesh netting).  Surfclams &gt; 12 mm SL grew to 38-50 mm (1.5-2-inches) in two years in both habitats. Surfclam larvae and juveniles did not retain saxitoxin from toxic dinoflagellates for extended periods of time in the lab, suggesting that this species is an excellent culture cand...",THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE

Thermoplastic elastomers combine the desirable properties of crosslinked elastomers (like car tires) with low processing costs and recyclability of thermoplastics. This newly developed class of multigraft copolymer-based thermoplastic elastomers is called ""superelastomers"" and holds promise for improved processability and recyclability of rubbery materials used in many different products such as gloves, earbuds, condoms, nipples for baby bottles, etc. The superelastomers also have the potential to open up new applications for elastomer materials. These designer elastomers constitute a new concept where macromolecular architecture (the shape of the molecule) is used to create the desired property profile. Through partnerships and collaborations fostered by this project, the research team will progress from knowledge generated by fundamental research toward new products that will enhance U.S. competitiveness, and the partner companies will have access to new designer elastomer technology. 

The broader impacts of this research are the creation of new jobs to stimulate the economy, and the reduction of the worldwide carbon footprint by developing a new class of highly tunable thermoplastic elastomers that have the potential to both be recyclable and reduce energy consumption during manufacturing. 

Partners at the inception of this project are the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (Department of Chemistry, School of Business Administration, and Research Foundation), BBB Elastomers (small business, Knoxville, TN), Asius Technologies (small business, Longmont, CO), InaMei Skin Care (small business, Hadley, MA), MAPA GmbH (large business, Zeven, Germany), Fuji Film (large business, Dayton, TN), Technology 20/20 (non-profit, Oak Ridge, TN), and Venture Incite (regional venture capital firm, Oak Ridge, TN).",,,"We have developed a new class of elastomers (rubbers) with exceptional mechanical properties and improved processability. These materials, which we call superelastomers, can be stretched to 20 times their initial length with almost perfect elastic recovery. Unlike conventional rubbers, these materials, which are thermoplastic elastomers, do not require chemical crosslinking or vulcanization. Thus, they can be processed more cheaply and, unlike conventioal elastomers (car tires for example), they can be recycled. These materials will result in energy savings and are environmentally friendly.

Our work has shown that control of molecular architecture (how the chemical building blocks are assembled together) can have a major impact of the proprties of the material. This concept is not specific to a particular chemistry but s broadly applicable in the field of elastomerss, with applications including thinner more sensitive condoms, thinner gloves to increase the dexterity of surgeons, new adhesives, improved medical tubing, etc.

A portfolio of patents have been developed to protect the intellectual property developed in this work. The technology developed in this project has been licensed by Zeon Chemicals for commercialization, which will result in new and improved elastomeric products to benefit society. This project also trained a number of students in diverse areas including chemistry, business, and law.

The approach relies on co-polymerization of inorganic and organic polymer precursors to create composite materials in which inorganic nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in an electrically conductive carbon host. This platform technology will be applied to the development of new high-energy battery cathodes and anodes based on metal/carbon, metal sulfide/carbon, and metal oxide/carbon nanocomposites. Batteries based on the new composite electrodes offer energy storage capacities four to five times higher than the most advanced units in use today and are expected to find applications in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles. By incorporating highly conductive graphene structures into the composite materials, the project further aims to develop supercapacitors with high power and high energy storage capacities for the power utility grid storage. In addition, the project utilizes mixed metal precursors to create composites based on metal alloys and inter-metallic nanoparticles that facilitate independent control of the magnetic permeability and electrical conductivity.

The broader impacts of this research ultimately will include acceleration of commercialization of several unique battery systems with potential market-changing impacts. The global market for secondary batteries alone was estimated to be $11-$13 billion in 2010 and is expected to quadruple by 2020. By bringing together researchers from Cornell University, known world-wide for their innovative contributions in the rechargeable batteries field, with two Up-State New York technology concerns possessing complementary expertise on materials synthesis, formulation, and manufacturing, the project creates a path toward commercial deployment of lithium battery systems that offer multiple unique features.  These features include best-in-class energy storage capacity and best-in-class power density. The project will also develop materials and manufacturing processes for battery electrodes, supercapacitors, and magnetic materials that are familiar from other sectors of technology. By doing so, costs associated with deployment of battery manufacturing processes will be contained--a required first-step for improving competitiveness of the new lithium battery systems in the marketplace.

These battery configurations are important for at least three inter-related reasons. First, they offer storage capacities that exceed (by factors of 4 to 6) goals defined by the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) for batteries required for Electric Vehicles entering the marketplace in 2020. Second, rechargeable batteries based on the new nanocomposite electrodes offer energy storage capacities 4 to 5 times higher than the most advanced units in use today. Finally, batteries based on Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) and Sodium-sulfur (Na-S) technologies under development in the project take advantage of low cost of sulfur ($0.02/g), which is available in regions all around the world, often as a byproduct of coal or petroleum production.
 
Commercialization of practical Li-S and Na-S cells able to operate stably at room temperature has been hindered by stubborn challenges related to poor electrode kinetics, ineffective active material utilization, loss of the active material to the electrolyte by dissolution, and limited cell lifetimes. This Partnerships for Innovation program award to Cornell and two Knowledge Enhancement Partners (KEP), NOHMS Technologies and Graphene Devices, focused on development and commercialization of scalable approaches for enhancing electrical transport in a sulfur cathode and for preventing cell failure by the mechanisms outlined above. Research performed in the project took advantage of density functional theoretical (DFT) analysis to design nitrogen-containing polymers that can be tethered to carbon to create composite cathodes with strong binding energies for sulfur to maximize utilization and prevent sulfur loss to the battery electrolyte. The project developed multiple scalable in-situ process for manufacturing such nanocomposites based on highly conductive microporous carbons, which our studies show are highly effective in overcoming all of the challenges that have inhibited commercial development of Li-S and Na-S batteries. The project also developed two new deposition processes that allow multilayered sorbent coatings to be applied to the separator or anode of a Li-S or Na-S battery. In so doing, the research in this PFI project has demonstrated multiple sulfur cathode and separator configurations that enable stable long-term charge/discharge cycling of high-energy lithium-sulfur and sodium-sulfur batteries suitable for commercial development.
 
A highlight among the project outcomes is that the partnership with KEP NOHMs Technologies has opened up exciting, new opportunities for cathode design and for separator engineering that are already being implemented to create room-temperature lithium-sulfur batteries for aerospace, automotive, and portable electronics markets. Another highlight among the PFI project outcomes relates to opportunities the project provided for educating graduate students. In addition to developing fundamental skills in materials chemistry, materials physics, and electrochemistry to design materials configurations able to overcome the difficulties with Li-S and Na-S battery technologies, students supported by the project worked in collaboration with KEP partners on development of scalable manufacturing processes for these materials and in evaluating potential market opportunities for products developed in the study. This range of experiences is uncommon in university-based research projects, but is a requirement for workforce development. It is an important strength of the PFI program.

The transformative winding filament hypothesis for muscle contraction, developed with funding from NSF, has important implications for understanding muscle physiology and motor control, as well as for improving robotic assistive devices in general. This research has demonstrated the ability to use algorithms that utilize this hypothesis to provide control of a robotic, foot-ankle prosthesis. 

The hypothesis-based muscle control model, in combination with a musculoskeletal system framework, has shown a robust capability to allow for varied terrain applications beyond the level walking environment.  This capability shows tremendous promise, given that current control methods for the powered prosthesis market show limited ability to conduct realistic human gait control for environments other than level walking.  Figure 1, attached, demonstrates the winding filament muscle groups (approximated as one anterior and one posterior for ankle control) exerting control over time to produce appropriate ankle toque during a level walking simulation.   This simulation was based upon results from actual experiments with a particular subject using the robotic prosthesis.  Figure 2 illustrates experimental results from controlling the robotic prosthesis, used by a subject, during stair ascension.  The results, though preliminary and with an early control software version, show similar commanded torque results to that of published healthy ankle torque data for stair ascent.

The research provided a baseline for single joint, lower-limb control exploration.  Future research has already been proposed to expand the bio-inspired control approach to lower body dynamics.  A research proposal has been submitted jointly with Ekso Bionics to provide active actuation to both ankles of their exoskeleton platform, in order to explore leg coordination in standing balance, level walking, and ambulation over complex terrain. Testing the ability of the control algorithm based on the winding filament hypothesis to achieve robust control of leg coordination in these tasks will improve our understanding of human motor control. In the long term, exoskeletons also provide the opportunity to test the new bioinspired control approach in multi-joint coordination of active ankle, knee, and hip actuation.

Broader Impacts: 

This research has potential to improve our understanding of improved neuro-musculoskeletal models as applied wide applications in biomechanics.  The results will inspire the design of a new generation of actuators and prostheses that have the potential to possess the adaptability and energy efficiency displayed by animal muscles.  

Future research has the potential to apply the research technological advances to exoskeletal control.  In the U.S. today, approximately 5.6 million persons live with mobility impairment. Despite the success of the latest technological improvements, significant challenges remain in the development of robotic assistive devices. No exoskeletons available on the market today have ankle actuation or the stability and robustness required for high function in the home setting. These limitations affect quality of life by hindering participation in daily activities, including maintenance of physical fitness. Benefits of a robust exoskeleton with ankle actuation include improved standing postural balance, increased speed of walking, and improved maneuvering over varied terrain. The application of the bio-inspired control algorithms, developed from this research, will potentially expand the exoskeleton market from the clinical setting to the home. 

This research has demonstrated the advantages of data streaming and appropriate analysis of the data with the use of robotic prosthesis devices.

Inorganic nano-particles consist of an inorganic (metal or metal oxide) core 1 to 100 nm in diameter surrounded by a shell of molecular or polymeric coatings. The wide variety of the physical properties of the core materials and the selective binding capabilities of the ligands and coatings comprise a versatile tool kit with commercial applications across nearly every industrial sector.  However, commercialization of these nanomaterials has been limited by difficulties in translating the synthesis methods used during discovery research to reliable commercial scale production.  This project aims to address research problems at the frontiers of nano-science by developing improved materials measurement and characterization techniques that will enable nanoparticles to be produced and their properties optimized, advancing the state of the art in nanoscience, and thus accelerating the commercialization process itself.

The broader impacts of this project are related to economics, education, and diversity. The small companies that participate in the knowledge enhancement partners (KEP) group will develop production techniques that are reproducible, reliable, scalable, fast, efficient, robust, precise, and inexpensive. These improvements will enable large-scale economic opportunities in photovoltaics, solid-state lighting and display technologies. The project will enable the acceleration of the commercialization of nanoparticles in other sectors, including: energy storage, catalysis, information technology, cancer treatment, and environmental remediation. Students and faculty members who participate in this project will learn to conduct basic research in an explicitly technological and industrial context.  The KEP will encourage the participation of under-represented groups by offering summer research experiences to community college students.

However, commercialization of these nanomaterials has been limited by difficulties in translating the synthesis methods used during discovery research to reliable commercial scale production, and there are limitations of the measurement techniques used to assess the quality of materials produced. To address the fundamental scientific challenges that inhibit innovation, this project brought together expertise from the university, four small business partners and additional private sector partners to advance innovation and accelerate the commercialization of inorganic nanoparticle technologies.

The research team addressed problems at the frontiers of nanoscience, guided by the technical issues confronting the partnership companies. In one focus area, the team developed improved materials measurement and characterization techniques that enable academic researchers and manufacturing engineers to elucidate the reactions by which nanoparticles can be produced and their properties optimized.  In a second focus area, the team advanced the state of the art in nanomaterial production to accelerate the commercialization process.

Major findings of our research include:

New, rapid nanoparticle characterization techniques.  Traditional methods of determining the size and structure of nanomaterials are slow, tedious and expensive.  The research team developed new methods of characterization based upon x-ray scattering that were faster, easier and less costly.  Several studies demonstrated how these new methods accelerate development of new nanomaterials with properties optimized for applications from microelectronics to biology.
New, continuous growth techniques for metal oxide nanocrystal synthesis.  Metal oxide nanocrystals have a myriad of uses in applications requiring magnetic materials, transparent conductors and active catalysts.  The research team discovered a new synthesis method that permits exquisite control over the placement of individual atoms within the nanocrystals while simultaneously controlling the size of the finished nanocrystal.  This unprecedented level of structural control provides an opportunity to manipulate the optical, magnetic and electronic properties to fuel new applications of these materials.
Flow reactors for reliable production of precisely defined nanoparticles. A significant challenge in nanoparticle production is that the structure, and therefore the properties, of the nanoparticle can vary widely due to small changes in reaction conditions.  The research team developed a simple, yet powerful, flow reaction system that permits precise control of nanoparticle core size and over the composition of the surface coating.  Using the flow reactor, each batch of particles is the same and the size and composition can be predictably controlled during production.


The broader impacts of this project are related to economic development and education. The analysis and production techniques developed are reproducible, reliable, scalable, fast, efficient, robust, precise, and inexpensive. Thus, these advances should accelerate the nanomaterials innovation process. The outcomes of this project contribute to innovation and scaling in nanotechnology where there are large-scale economic opportunities in photovoltaics, solid-state lighting and display technologies. The methods developed as a result of this project project will accelerate the commercialization of nanoparticles in other sectors as well, including: energy storage, catalysis, information technology, cancer treatment, and environmental remediation.

Students and faculty members involved in this project learned to conduct basic research in an explicitly technological and industrial context.  To further their professional development and build their entrepreneurial skillset, participating students launch an Innovation Club and developed detailed, written professional development plans.

From a societal and economic standpoint, it contributes to addressing the national need for increased automation in multiple application domains, including advanced manufacturing, agriculture such as fruit picking, as well as rehabilitation and elderly care of an aging population in the US. The soft grasping approach proposed to be commercialized here is based on a recently patented dynamically tunable reversible dry adhesion technology, which can help resolve pain points in electronics assembly and advanced manufacturing processes such as irregular-shaped parts manipulation on automotive assembly lines. The commercialization potential is estimated to be on the order of one billion dollars. From an educational standpoint, this project not only helps train the senior personnel on the project about entrepreneurship, but also helps instill entrepreneurship principles and practices among students and researchers. 

This I-Corps project aims to identify the technical challenges faced by the industry on robotic gripping systems, which could help formulate ensuing application-driven fundamental problems pertaining to soft grasping. Soft grasping of objects with various shapes and stiffness has been a longstanding challenge in the robotics field. The approach proposed here is a spinoff of an ongoing NSF project, where novel smart materials and adhesion mechanics are integrated to realize a ""core-shell"" composite structure featured with dynamically tunable reversible dry adhesion. By modulating the stiffness of the ""core"" made of smart materials, the manner in which force is distributed to the interface between the composite and the adhered object is altered, and as a result, the effective adhesion strength of the adhered interface is changed.

1. Using customer discovery interviews to evaluate the commercialization potential for the dynamically tunable dry adhesion technology recently patented. After over 100 customer discovery interviews, most of which were in-person ones. The team reached a conclusion of ?no go? at the end of the cohort, and planned further customer discovery activities and technical improvement of the technology. After the cohort the team continued to explore relevant robotics industries in Fall 2018, Spring 2019, and Fall 2019.

2. Training student entrepreneurs and instill entrepreneurship into researchers through workshops and customer discovery interviews. An undergraduate and graduate students were exposed and trained to various aspects of enterpreneurship. The EL was an undergrad and then Master?s student with the TL?s research group at UNR. He got hands on training about entrepreneurship through this project. Other student members at the TL?s research group also benefited from the project updates of this project at group meetings. The PI&amp;TL Dr. Shan himself also engaged much in this project and learned much about multiple aspects of entrepreneurship. Application driven fundamental research and entrepreneurship have been emphasized at the TL?s research group.

3. Making industrial connections for potential PFI and SBIR/STTR proposals in the near future.  The former PI established contact with many robotic integrator companies as potential collaborators for PFI and SBIR/STTR projects in the near future.

While the solar energy industry is booming, its share of the total energy market is well below 1% whereas oil, natural gas, and coal is used for 85% of total energy consumption. The exhaustion of oil and gas supplies is ever growing near, and the negative environmental impacts caused from these energy sources is of great concern. Solar power is an excellent alternative energy source, but the technology involved can be costly. This project's solar cell embedded coating is substantially cheaper than traditional solar panels and can be implemented onto structures where solar panels would not be feasible. Application of this coating onto standard roofing materials provides an economical way to take advantage of solar energy.

This I-Corps project is for the commercialization potential of perovskite solar cells. The perovskite material is tin based, as opposed to the traditional, toxic lead-based variety. The lifetime of the perovskites is extended by the elimination of oxidation through encapsulating the perovskite solar cells at the atomic layer through our proprietary carbon bonding nanotechnology. These perovskite solar cells can be embedded into a coating to add solar energy capabilities to other materials. This technology expands the frontiers of nanoscience to address several core academic challenges: expanding the use of graphitic nanosystems into functional materials, developing alternative technologies to make solar power the dominant source of commercial energy in the United States, and providing skills of delivering this intellectual property into the marketplace through the I-Corps program.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,"To explore commercial opportunities for next-generation solar technology, the team comprising of Chester Wilson (PI), Chris Manspeaker (IM), Joshua Joffrion (EL) and Nicholas Groden (Co-EL) has successfully completed the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Program and has made great strides towards successful commercialization of perovskite solar cell infused coatings developed at Louisiana Tech University.

Throughout the seven weeks of the NSF I-Corps program, the team conducted and logged 140 interviews, 123 of which were in-person, throughout the U.S. solar market to assess the viability of commercialization for the solar cell infused coating. Interviews were conducted representing all archetypes of the customer ecosystem (i.e. end users, buyers, decision makers, influencers, evangelists, saboteurs) in order to develop an accurate model of the market ecosystem. A business model was developed from the insights obtained from the interviews based on the business model canvas paradigm. Value propositions were developed for each customer segment. Models were developed to get, keep, and grow customer relationships and various sales channels were evaluated. Near the end of the seven-week workshop, the focus transitioned into defining key activities, key resources, revenue streams, and cost structure, as well as identifying what types of entities would provide key partnerships necessary for the success of the company.

Before participating in the I-Corps program, we were certain that our avenue into the solar market was the fact that our lightweight coating could be used on roofs where the added weight of traditional heavy solar panels made solar energy an inviable option. We learned in our day one interviews that the added weight is very seldom a concern and that the largest deterrent on solar adoption is fire code regulations. This prompted an immediate pivot and the beginnings of a journey into studying the regulations involved with the installation of solar equipment. Along the way, we learned that the wellbeing of the solar market in any given region is defined by the attitude of local power companies and policymakers. Among those interviewed were solar contractors, homeowners, regulatory bodies, utility companies, politicians, advocacy groups, commercial project managers, industrial project managers, and architects. We found that one of the most universal pain points amongst solar contractors is the difficulty they face in penetrating the commercial market due to the returns-on-investments and payback periods they are able to offer being rendered unappealing as a result of various regulations. Our final working hypothesis was: For salespeople at solar contracting companies aiming to increase sales in the commercial sector, we provide solarcell infused coatings that will allow them to close an additional 30% of commercial contracts through offering better returns-on-investment and shorter payback periods.

Since completing the official program, the remaining period of the grant award was used in gearing up for submittal of a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant. This submittal was pre-reviewed, and refinements are being executed. In continuing to conduct customer discovery interviews to improve upon the developed business model, we learned that the recyclability of solar energy equipment is an upcoming issue current solar manufacturing companies are facing as U.S. policies on the matter are moving towards what is currently in place in Europe. Thus, we attended an international trade show for electronics recyclers in Europe to learn about this newly identified key activity that needed to be incorporated into our business model. While there, we sought out interviews with companies in the region that are currently in research and development phases on perovskite solar cell products to learn about their business models and initiate dialogues on collaboration.

Excited about these potential partnerships, the team has decided to apply for the NSF?s Partnerships for Innovation Program (PFI). The team is currently preparing a proposal for the PFI program to be submitted in July 2019. One major focus while participating in this program will be to develop and cultivate key industry partnerships that will be critical for the launching of a start-up company.

Microwave microstrip resonators have been used to measure soil water content for decades. A new technique for fingerprinting the presence of de-icing fluid, liquid water or ice and quantifying their amount on the surface of the resonator was developed at the University of Michigan. This project focuses on translating?this discovery?into a new type of instrument for aircraft ice detection. 

Icing is hazardous to aircraft and occurs in ways that are difficult for pilots to detect. In addition, icing can occur throughout the year in nearly all regions of the globe, making detection and avoidance an important component of flight safety procedures. Unfortunately, existing icing detection systems are not capable of detecting ice directly on the structure of airplanes, where ice accumulation could disrupt the airflow and cause loss of control.  The aircraft icing detection system developed in this project fills this gap.  A prototype microstrip resonator will be developed that will be mounted flush with the aircraft surface. Work will be done to correlate the frequencies and resonance modes to distinguish between ice, water, and spongy ice for a range of ice thicknesses on the aircraft surface. It is expected that the work will show that the prototype can measure the thickness of films of water and de-icing fluid ranging from sub-millimeter to a few millimeters.

This project also contributes to the education of various graduate students. The project engages?master students?in technology translation efforts from research discovery toward commercial products. The students will gain hands on experience while being mentored by academics and practitioners.",,,"This Accelerating Innovation Research Technology Translation (AIR-TT) transformed a microwave microstrip resonator originally developed for measuring soil water content into an aircraft icing detection instrument. Microwave microstrip resonators have been used to measure soil water content for decades. We recently developed and patented an innovative way of using this type of instrument for detecting ice accumulation on aircraft surfaces. In particular, we developed a technique for fingerprinting the presence of de-icing fluid, liquid water or ice and quantifying their amount on a microstrip resonator that could be embedded in the surface of an aircraft. We also developed an optical instrument capable of detecting supercooled water and supercooled large droplets (SLDs) in the airspace around aircrafts. We discovered that there is a need for our icing detection technologies because they respond to changes in the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR Part 25) that became effective in January 2015.
 
Ice causes accidents and disruptions in most transportation activities. Icing conditions are hazardous to aircraft and occur in ways that are difficult for pilots to detect. In addition, airborne icing can occur throughout the year in nearly all regions of the globe, making detection and avoidance important for flight safety. Indeed, SLD is extremely hazardous to aircrafts because it can cause rapid ice accumulation behind ice-protected areas. Unfortunately, existing icing detection systems are not capable of detecting ice directly on critical areas of an airplane, where ice accumulation could disrupt the airflow and cause loss of control even when icing is not detectable by current sensors.
 
Our commercialization strategy is to negotiate non-exclusive licenses with companies that provide ice-protection systems for the transport aircraft market. Then, we plan to use the royalties from these licenses to develop systems for other markets.

The sensors are able to operate over a wide range of doses, perform equally well in air or under vacuum, and can clearly distinguish between positively and negatively charged ions, which are critical for most radiation-detection applications. Considering size, weight, power-consumption, performance and cost parameters, this technology is well-poised to be an extremely attractive alternative to many current ionizing radiation detection approaches.",,,"The NSF I-Corps award support was utilized to explore the commercialization potential of the PI's invention based around sensitive ion detection. As a part of the program, the PI, along with the project Entrepreneurial Lead (EL) and the project business mentor (BM), attended an workshop hosted by NSF and conducted by Venturewell to learn how to conduct customer discovery, develop value propositions, and various other essential components that help the formulation of a business model canvas. During the workshop, the team conducted over 100 customer discovery interviews in the defense, hospitals and home radon market segments, pivoted two times, identified at the end of the workshop that at that point, we were a ""no-go"", i.e. we had not yet completely sure  of our product market fit, and beachhead market. The team did discover, however, strong market potentials and key challenges that needed help from industry leaders, influencers, and high-tech expertise. Over the next year, the team continued to explore more vigorously, networked with key government and commercial leaders, and began to solidify its business components. We recognized at an early stage that we had significant technology and business risks, and carefully started identifying the pathways for de-risking both business and technology aspects. Over the last year, the following steps were taken to address these issues.

1. On the business development side, after completing the I-Corps workshop in Fall, 2016, the team competed and entered MassChallenge (during Summer 2017), one of the most prestigious equity-free venture acceleration programs in the US. Out of &gt;1400 applications, the team was selected to join a 128-strong cohort that underwent a rigorous venture development exercise. The team participated quite successfully and went on to become one of the gold award winner ($50,000 non equity-diluting cash prize) . It also received a CASIS/Boeing ~$200k prize/award for conducting technology in space research. After completing this program successfully, the team was also selected to participate in an extremely prestigious venture acceleration program, Techstars (which provided the first equity-diluting investment), and a start-up company was formed (Guardion, Inc.) in December, 2017, to participate in this program. The Techstars program was backed by AFWERX - the elite US Air Force supported tech development agency, and this program allowed Guardion, to successfully explore, for the first time - deep areas of need within the US defense sector. Guardion has now successfully completed this program, and has established a strong connection with various defense acquisition agencies that have clearly outlined their needs that align with Guardion's areas of technology development. Along the way, Guardion has become aware of a number of other market needs in the areas of gas sensing/detection, mass spectrometry, and materials process monitoring applications.

2. On the Technology development side, the PI and his Co-inventor were able to leverage the customer discovery and market needs knowledge of the I-Corps program to successfully procure a $200k NSF PFI-AIR:TT to develop proof-of-concept low-cost ionizing radiation devices at Northeastern University. This support was leveraged to develop proof-of-concept X-ray detectors. At the end of the PFI project, further support will be sought the develop gamma dosimeters and spectroscopic gamma detectors. Currently, the technology is being transferred out of Northeastern University to Guardion, in the form of a portfolio of patents and patent applications that will be exclusively licensed to Guardion. Guardion has also leveraged the preliminary results from X-ray detection to successfully compete for a NASA SBIR phase-I project ($125k, currently under negotiation with NASA) to develop X-ray detectors for space applications. In a similar manner, Guardion is also currently submitting an SBIR phase I proposal to develop detectors for mass spectrometer applications.

The opportunity to recover chemical energy from wastewater, while widely recognized, is hindered by two challenges: the lack of an effective method to harness this energy and the cost incurred, i. e., amount of energy required, for wastewater treatment. Innovation of wastewater treatment that is sustainable and can recover potential energy is, thus, urgent. The primary goal of this project is to further the understanding of an advanced newly developed system, the oxygenic photogranule-based process, which has the potential to turn wastewater treatment plants into energy positive water resource recovery facilities.

The proposed research is based on the discovery and invention in the PIs research group that activated sludge can naturally transform into self-aerating biogranules and be used for flow-through systems for aeration-free wastewater treatment. Since aeration is the highest energy demand in operating existing wastewater treatment plants, development of this new technology can bring substantial energy savings. Phototrophic assimilation of CO2 within oxygenic photogranules also opens opportunities to recover wastewaters chemical energy and solar energy in the form of high quality bio-feedstock. These features may lead to a paradigm change in how wastewater is treated. This research will also reveal the mechanism by which oxygenic photogranules are formed under both static and hydrodynamic conditions, which is a unique phenomenon for this microbial granule. Furthermore, the research will address key questions, such as system adaptability to the deep-tank reactor operation under natural or engineered light conditions, which must be answered to scale up the process, substantially advancing the new technology for industrialization. This GOALI application proposes international, multidisciplinary collaboration between academia and industry to: 1) improve fundamental understanding of the oxygenic photogranule granulation phenomenon, and, 2) engineer the key components of this new technology for commercialization. To accomplish these goals, the PIs propose three research aims: 1) to elucidate the granulation phenomenon in reactor operation; 2) to engineer the light pattern to advance the oxygenic photogranule process for industrial use; and, 3) to investigate the feasibility of the oxygenic photogranule process for municipal wastewater treatment. 

This research will involve studies of advanced microscopy, deep-sequencing based microbial ecology, physiology of oxygenic photogranules, and reactor hydrodynamics to understand oxygenic photogranule formation, in reactor operation and its comparison to granulation occurring under static cultivation conditions. This project will also conduct substantial reactor studies to investigate the impact of light pattern on granulation and additional N removal by the biological nutrient removal mechanism. Finally, the project will carry out a pilot to investigate the feasibility of the oxygenic photogranule process for municipal wastewater treatment with development of the economic cost model for the oxygenic photogranule process; thus, the data generated during this research will be easily transferred to industry. This research is transformative because it will develop a new technology to change energy consuming wastewater treatment plants into energy positive facilities. Successful development and industrialization of the oxygenic photogranule process will therefore bring substantial societal and environmental impact. This project involves well-planned multidisciplinary research comprising collaboration among U.S.-based academia and industry and a research institute in France. Working with industry partners is essential for this project because its ultimate goal is to implement the process in municipalities. The project will use collaboration between the PIs at university and industry to mentor each other, industrialize the process, and disseminate the research at both academic and industry meetings. The project also includes international collaboration to promote oxygenic photogranule research and reach out to broader scientists and engineers around the world. The French researchers also submitted the proposal to their national funding agency, which will complement the oxygenic photogranule research to be done in the U.S. This GOALI will also enhance the PIs collaboration with researchers and students from a womens liberal arts college, to apply microscopy to understand the granulation phenomenon. During this project, the PI will continue to reach out to Kenyan collaborators to work together for sanitation in Kenya and to initiate an oxygenic photogranule pilot in Kenya in the future. Finally, the PIs groups will have continuous outreach to municipalities in the region, to spread awareness and incite excitement among municipal employees to be connected to and involved with academic research.","Milferstedt, K., Hamelin, J., Park, C., Jung, J., Cho, S., Jung, K., Kim, D.~Biogranules applied in environmental engineering~International Journal of Hydrogen Energy~42~2017~27801~~~0~ ~0~ ~03/07/2018 21:00:56.83000000, Ansari, A.A., Abouhend, A.S., Park, C.~Effects of seeding density on photogranulation and the start-up of the oxygenic photogranule process for aeration-free wastewater treatment~Algal Research~40~2019~10495~~~0~ ~0~ ~01/12/2019 12:11:41.410000000, Abouhend, A.S., McNair, A., Kuo-Dahab, W.

In OPG-based wastewater treatment systems, mixing not only provides contacts among particles, thus enhancing granulation, but also allows granules to contact with light, leading to photosynthesis, a driving force of OPG formation. When we operated reactors with different mixing intensities, we observed strong influence of mixing conditions on OPG's size development. Compact smaller and more uniform OPGs (0.5-1.5 mm) were formed under high mixing intensities. In decreasing mixing intensity, size uniformity declined, and bigger granules were formed. The OPG biomass greater than 3 mm typically showed layered structure, which could support the development of anoxic conditions useful for removing nitrogen. These findings suggest an opportunity to use small mixing energy for the OPG system, coupled with effective formation of OPGs. Furthermore, if necessary, intermittent high mixing could be introduced to produce small size OPGs, without causing deterioration in the formation of OPGs.

While we learned that light intensity has large impact on the formation of OPGs, the most important lesson we learned through this GOALI project is probably photoinhibition phenomenon. One may expect that more light would be generally useful for supporting photosynthesis-based bioprocesses. However, we learned that exposure of OPGs under too strong light, such as the conditions we can expect from very sunny day, for extended periods could significantly damage OPGs and eventually lead to a system upset. We obtained this knowledge from our earlier pilot attempts that we conducted with a shallow 500 L reactor under natural light conditions. This outcome enabled us to begin new investigations on photoinhibition phenomenon and supported our original postulation that the OPG system should be used in a deep reactor with mixing. In this case, OPGs will not be exposed to strong sun light for a long period and they can also recover by undergoing through a darker area in a deep reactor. With the preliminary data we obtained and the rationale of this approach, we obtained a new NSF grant entitled ""PFI-RP: Developing light-controlled mixing to advance energy efficient wastewater treatment by oxygenic photogranules"". This new grant, with an US-based industry partner, BKT, Co., Ltd., will facilitate a new pilot effort in a much larger scale (approximately 7000 gallon reactor) and significantly enhance technology transfer and industrialization of the OPG process for wastewater treatment.

We have disseminated the results of the GOALI project via multiple venues. The team has published five peer-reviewed journal articles. Three of these articles were written by PhD students as a first author who worked for the current project. Also, the co-authors in four articles are from collaborating institutes, including INRA-LBE (French National Institute for Agricultural Research-Laboratory of Environmental Biotechnology), Inha University, and Mount Holyoke College. There are also multiple manuscripts that are currently in revision or in preparation, which are the results of this GOALI project.

We made 10 presentations on this GOALI research at national and international conferences. Two Master students who worked for the project completed their MS theses. We also expect to have four PhD dissertations from the students who were involved in this GOALI project within the next few months to a year.

We obtained a U.S. Patent on the OPG process in January 2019. BKT obtained an option agreement from UMass for their use of the OPG process for commercial purpose. These as well as continuous collaboration between UMass and BKT through a new NSF PFI project will enhance the efforts on technology transfer and commercialization of this university lab-born technology.

The project supported and engaged underrepresented students and researchers. The project supported two African PhD students, two female PhD students, and one female MS student for their research on OPGs. The project also provided an opportunity to undergraduate students and K-12 students, including five female undergraduate students and two high school and middle school students.

Finally, international collaboration on OPGs flourished through the period of this GOALI project. The GOALI team continued to work with collaborators from INRA-LBE in France, Inha University and UNIST in South Korea, and Chiba University in Japan. These collaborations have led to the co-production of knowledge and multiple publications as well as obtaining new research grants on OPGs in the U.S., France, Japan, and South Korea.

This project will result in the development and field demonstration of a modular prototype ""E-tongue"" probe. This E-tongue probe will facilitate accurate, rapid, and cost-effective detection and quantification of heavy metals and have a direct impact on improving health and safety of humans. Standard spectro-analytical methods are expensive, bulky and require trained personnel for operation. The E-Tongue probe has the following unique features and advantages over existing laboratory and portable technologies, including: a) Portability and robustness, enabling rapid on-site testing; b) High sensitivity to detect multiple toxic metal ions below EPA specified maximum contamination limits; c) Integrated pH and temperature sensor for additional data and improved accuracy; d) User-friendly; and e) Low cost. By ascertaining levels of heavy metal contaminants at sites with sufficient accuracy in real-time, the E-Tongue probe can assist engineers to make onsite decisions, such as determining optimum locations for placement of monitoring wells, identifying hot-spots for sample collection for detailed laboratory testing, and adjusting field activity to control remediation options. It will also provide regulatory agencies with critical information so that they can take appropriate steps such as communicating drinking water advisories in a timely manner. 

The project will result in the creation of a field deployable prototype E-tongue probe comprising an electrochemical sensor array, data acquisition/control and intelligent pattern recognition software. To develop the prototype, and move from research discovery to commercial application, the project will address the following technology gaps: 1) Simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, 2) Interfering compounds and electrode fouling, 3) Effects of temperature and pH, 4) Sampling challenges in the monitoring well and sediment testing systems. These technology gaps will be overcome by the use of multiple modified electrodes to enhance selectivity and sensitivity, elimination of interference and fouling through the use of appropriate sampling electrolytes and electrode protection strategies, integration of pH and temperature sensors to compensate for variations in pH and temperature, and incorporation of automated sampling systems. This project will provide the investigators, postdoctoral researcher and graduate student, the experience in transforming novel discoveries into prototype devices to solve real-world problems, as well as interdisciplinary, multicultural, global entrepreneurship experience through the Manning School of Business ""Global Entrepreneurship and Innovation"" program.

Both the developed and developing worlds face a critical need to produce clean, healthy water, cheaply, in the face of diminishing quantities and quality of water from current sources. One of the most promising developments in drinking water supply over the past two decades is the improvement in membrane-based treatment processes. However, these systems still operate well below their potential because the membrane pores are easily plugged (fouled). The process being developed in this project uses a new type of particle (heated aluminum oxide particles, or HAOPs) to collect contaminants and deploys the particles in an unconventional way (depositing an extremely thin layer of the particles on a support and passing the water through that layer), and thereby removes far more of the material that plugs the pores of membranes than can be removed using currently available processes. Furthermore, the process appears likely to use less energy and be less costly than current technology. The outcome of the project will be a design for a pilot-scale system that can be tested at an operating drinking water treatment plant.

The technical issues requiring investigation for the new treatment process to be successful include the development of a new module containing substantial surface area onto which the HAOPs can be deposited, while still maintaining a relatively small footprint. The proposed design is a monolithic, but porous, cylinder containing multiple small, cylindrical channels penetrating the full axial length. The HAOPs layer will be deposited along the walls of these channels, so that feed water must pass through the layer and then through the porous solid before exiting. The module must capture the HAOPs efficiently at the beginning of a treatment cycle and then release them equally efficiently at the end. Both the deposition and release steps require optimal choices and careful control of the water flow patterns, and that optimization step will be a major focus of the project. In addition, the approaches for dewatering and compacting sludge from the process will be explored, and a cost-benefit analysis of the overall process will be carried out. Finally, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a postdoctoral researcher, will receive entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through mentorship by a partner on the research team who has co-founded three companies in the energy efficiency and water treatment sectors, and by participation in meetings with potential manufacturers of the equipment and investors in the technology.","Modarresi, S., and Benjamin, M.~Insights and Model for Understanding Natural Organic Matter Adsorption onto Mixed Adsorbents~Environmental Science and Technology~~2018~~~10.1021/acs.est.8b00849~0~ ~0~ ~22/05/2018 18:59:17.946000000",,"The world is facing a water crisis brought on by population growth, urbanization, climate change, and the contamination of existing sources. In response, the water purification industry has developed new technology to remove contaminants from low-quality water at reasonable cost. Water filtration through membranes is at the forefront of this technological revolution and is widely recognized as the most significant advance in water treatment in over a century. Membranes are used not only to produce drinking water, but also for wastewater treatment, primarily in the form of membrane bioreactors (MBRs) for removing biodegradable contaminants from sewage. Even so, membrane-based processes for drinking water treatment are plagued by inefficiencies related to ""fouling"", in which the very contaminants that are removed by the membranes block the pores and impede subsequent water flow. In addition, while MBRs have been very successful at removing organic contaminants from wastewater, they do not remove phosphorus very efficiently, leading to harmful or toxic algal blooms in the receiving waters to which the treated sewage is discharged.

This project focused on further development and scale-up of a novel process that can dramatically mitigate both of the problems noted above. This process combines use of a new type of particle that was invented by the researchers with a novel approach for contacting the particles with the water being treated. In small-scale testing prior to initiation of this project, the process was shown to reduce the rate of membrane fouling by at least a factor of 10, substantially lowering the capital and operational costs of treatment. In addition, preliminary tests suggested that applying the process to treated sewage could efficiently remove phosphorus from the water.

Although the small-scale tests conducted prior to this project had validated the science underlying the new process, the reactors used in those tests could not be scaled up to the size needed for full-scale implementation of the process or to treat the flow rates required for the process to be commercially viable. The project effort therefore focused on designing larger treatment units and testing them at larger flow rates, for both drinking water and wastewater treatment applications.

The project was successful, in that multiple designs were iteratively constructed and tested, each one an improvement on the previous one. By the end of the project, a unit that could treat water at &gt;20 times the rate of the one used in preliminary testing had been successfully demonstrated, and one that could treat water at five times that rate was under construction. In addition, the research indicated that similar units could remove phosphorus from MBR-treated wastewater extremely effectively. The ultimate design had numerous features that were first conceived during the project and that are currently being submitted for patent protection.

In addition to efficiently removing the target contaminants from the feed waters, the new process generates a sludge that can be separated from the solution immensely more easily than the sludge that is generated using current technology. The cost of sludge processing is often a significant contributor to the overall cost of water treatment, so this feature will be important in the economic attractiveness of the process.

Finally, the research demonstrated that the novel particles that we developed interact synergistically with other particles that are sometimes used In water treatment, so that when mixtures of the particles are contacted with the feed water, contaminant removal is better than when either particle is applied alone.

Water engineering consulting firms and water utilities from around the world have expressed interest in the technology, especially since we have begun reporting the results at larger scales. Furthermore, the results of this project have helped justify a follow-up project that will demonstrate the technology at both water and wastewater treatment plants in the US as well as facilities in Europe and Asia. The project is thus already having impacts in the technical world of water treatment, and we are optimistic that, as its potential benefits are disseminated more widely, it will lead to widespread benefits to society by facilitating more efficient and less expensive water treatment, and better protection of natural waters into which treated wastewater is discharged.

The technologies proposed for commercialization in collaboration with our partners will fill technology gaps in the following areas: 1) super-resolution cellular imaging for biology and medicine, 2) novel non-photobleaching labels for imaging of cell dynamics, 3) monitoring cellular response to cancer drugs, and 4) automated blood pathology for disease detection and monitoring. These technologies have the following market-valued features: 1) outstanding image quality at resolutions that are at least 8 times higher (volume-wise) than the diffraction limit, that provide exemplary performance at lower, and thus more forgiving, illumination intensities when compared to leading optical microscopy technologies; 2) provide the ability to use non-photobleaching SERS (surface enhanced Raman scattering) labels for cellular imaging of cell dynamics, for monitoring unique biomarkers that cannot yet be monitored with other techniques; 3) capability to monitor cellular responses to cancer drugs in almost real-time by using Raman cytometry and in a more efficient manner compared with other experimental strategies; and 4) automated, real-time, point-of-care blood testing systems that provide enormous cost savings when compared to impedance-based, large, skilled labor-intensive and expensive commercially-available blood pathology systems.  
The Ecosystem for Biophotonics Innovation accomplishes this transfer to the market either by working in collaboration with research partners and transferring technologies to them, or via spinoffs, resulting in creation of new jobs (Entrepreneurial Fellows in academia, scientists collaborators in industry, and scientists in startup companies), commercial products for biology and medicine, with the potential to advance research and help patients while also training entrepreneurial scientists and generating licensing and royalty revenues. The partnerships engaged to transfer the technologies to the market domain include: 1) Applied Precision Inc, a GE Healthcare Company - will commercialize software algorithms for next generation super-resolution microscopes; 2) BD Biosciences - will commercialize novel SERS labels for studying cell dynamics; 3) Keaton Raphael Memorial foundation - will invest financial resources to advance technologies for diagnosis and treatment of pediatric cancers and to launch a startup company to commercialize the most promising technologies; 4) SARTA - will provide links to entrepreneurs in the region and educational opportunities; and 5) Tahoe Institute for Rural Health Research - will commercialize the automatic blood pathology system. 
The potential economic impact is expected to be realized through: 1) employing highly skilled and productive entrepreneurial fellows, faculty, as well as the scientists at our partnering organizations; 2) employing highly skilled scientists in spinoff companies; 3) licensing of technologies; and 4) through product sales (e.g., next generation super-resolution optical microscopes, labels and assays for cellular imaging, assays for monitoring cellular response to cancer drugs, and automated pathology systems), in the next one-to-five years. All these activities will ultimately contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the biomedical technology market space through ensuring that cutting-edge technologies are commercialized in the U.S. instead of by scientists and companies from other countries and through providing excellent professional development opportunities to talented entrepreneurial fellows who we expect will have innovative and resourceful careers beyond their tenure with EBI. In the short term, the societal impact includes the movement of advanced technologies closer to commercialization, as well as hands-on training and learning for the next generation of scientists and entrepreneurs regardless of whether entrepreneurial fellows pursue careers in academia or in the private sector. In the long term, the societal impact includes enhancement of scientific discovery enabled by cutting-edge instruments, medical devices, techniques and assays, better understanding of biophysical phenomena, and ultimately improved patient care. EBI will also benefit society by strengthening an infrastructure to promote innovation and to educate would-be entrepreneurs, while also enabling universities to more productively partner with private industry.","Smith ZJ, Gao T, Chu K, Lane SM, Matthews DL, Dwyre DM, Hood J, Tatsukawa K, Heifetz L, Wachsmann-Hogiu S.~Single-step preparation and image-based counting of minute volumes of human blood~Lab on a Chip~~2014~~~10.1039/c4lc00567h~0~ ~0~ ~07/10/2020 04:03:39.996000000, Tingjuan Gao, Zachary James Smith, Tzu-yin Lin, Danielle Carrade Holt, Stephen M.

During the lifetime of this award:

We built upon and expanded our biophotonics innovation ecosystem that accelerates the commercialization of academic research technology and know-how into end-user validated biomedical technologies and devices. To do this, we strengthened existing partnerships and developed new ones, to expand our industry partner base.
We tested and optimized different concepts for the ecosystem by accelerating the commercialization of 6 technologies developed by scientists at UC Davis, in collaboration with end-users from medical and life science communities, i.e. product development teams.
We continued and refined our education and mentorship program for scientist innovators, including entrepreneurial fellows (eFellows), to better equip them to become creative leaders in technology maturation and commercialization, with highly marketable skills.
We contributed to new economic growth and job creation by training PhD students and postdoctoral fellows in the process of technology development and commercialization, making them more suitable for jobs in the biophotonics industry. 


In the EBI ecosystem, we engaged with public and private entities on multiple levels, partners who matched NSF?s investment at least 1:1 with cash and in-kind contributions. Our EBI-2 partners and third-party investors for this award period are: GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, BD Biosciences, Keaton Raphael Memorial Foundation, Tahoe Institute for Rural Health Research, Agilent, Photometics, SARTA and its MedStart program, COMPASS Product Design, JDID Product Design and Development, Sacramento Angels, Velocity Venture Capital, Wavepoint Ventures, and academic partners from California State University at Sacramento, UC Davis College of Engineering, Graduate School of Management, Child Family Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and the UC Davis Health System. Each partner has a representative on the EBI Board of Directors. Dr. Steven Currall, Dean of the Graduate School of Management, chaired the Board of Directors.

EBI?s primary intellectual merit stems from the development of a unique alliance of committed partners who worked collaboratively to translate research-based technologies to the marketplace. Our scientists and eFellows accelerated technology commercialization in response to end-user needs, in collaboration with entrepreneurs and scientists from industry:

Materials used in outdoor protective structures, architectural or decorative elements, and construction are limited by degradation in sunlight or other harsh exposure.  The ALD technology is a unique approach to create ultra-thin and ultra-conformal coating layers onto polymer fibers with complex geometries.  These coatings have the capacity to protect the underlying polymer from damaging ultraviolet exposure from the sun or other light sources.  The coatings can compete with relatively expensive solution-dyed acrylic materials that now dominate the outdoor textile market.  The coating can work with a range of material substrates beyond those currently used.  Technology implementation requires new knowledge of process scaling and reactor design challenges. 

The project accomplishes this goal by exploring a unique ""flow-through"" reactor design prototype resulting in a demonstration vehicle to evaluate materials and process throughput capabilities to meet market demands.  The project engages VaporPulse Technologies to provide guidance in the field of coatings on fibers as well as expertise in project commercialization and marketing as they pertain to the potential to translate the science/technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.  The technology could have commercial impact well beyond UV protection. Other fiber systems that can benefit from improved coatings include filtration and separations media, personal protective equipment, electronic and medical textiles, or engineered fibers or fabrics for military personnel. In the long term, society will benefit by having materials and products that provide safe and reliable operation under harsh and variable outdoor conditions for longer times at lower cost.  The work will also have long-term impact by expanding foundational understanding of thin film reaction science and engineering with impact in many other future fields. This project will also help educate a PhD student in Chemical Engineering to learn the challenges of technology translation from a lab to a small business, allowing those skills to be expanded and passed on in the future.",,,"This project involved the design and constructioin of a prototype vapor-phase nano-coating system for roll-to-roll modification of woven and nonwoven textiles.  In previous studies in our lab supported by NSF and other agencies and industry, we discovered how chemical reactions involved in atomic layer deposition (ALD), used mostly in advanced semiconductor device manufacturing, could be used to precisely and uniformly modify the surfaces of polymer fibers and textiles, allowing new functionality such as chemical protection and electrical and thermal conductivity.

However, to be compatible with industry, ALD must be scalable to enable coatings to be applied continuously in roll-to-roll configurations similar to those currently used in textile manufacturing.   Speeds in those systems can be in the range of 10-12 meters per minute.  This project took on the challenge of designeing a reactor configureation that would allow this chemical process to transition from an enclosed chamber operating under vacuum, to a continous reactor operating under ambient pressure conditions. 

To acheive a viable reactor design, we used extensive mathematical modeling to understand how the vapors needed for the chemical reaction on the fiber surface could be transported from a storage vessel to impinge uniformly at high speed on a moving fabric sheet.  The gas flowed through a set of holes similar to a shower-head, where the flow designed a uniform gas pressure directly above the showerhead source.   A continuous conveyor belt design allows the fabric to be coated to move under the showerhead, delivering the reactive gas to the surface to achieve the desired nanoscale surface coating.  A schematic drawing of the reactor system is included in this report.

Through this project, we were able to develop a viable design that allowed us to seek further funding to fully construct and test the reactor system.  A photo of the current reactor system is also included.  Detailed studies of reactor performance are now underway, and we expect to publish our work in the coming months.

The translated science-based technology has the following unique features: very fast dissolution even for poorly water soluble drugs, a size small enough for incorporation into orally disintegrating dosages, and excellent flow and handing properties that provide exemplary performance using conventional robust processing methods that lead to efficient, scalable and cost-effective manufacturing when compared to the leading competing technologies such as spray drying and hot-melt extrusion for bioavailability enhancement, or freeze-dried fast disintegrating dosage forms in this market space.  

The project accomplishes this goal by combining fundamental aspects of surface science to reduce cohesion of carrier particles and to stabilize nano-drug particles, which are 300 times smaller than the diameter of human hair, to preserve their large surface area resulting in a proof-of-concept highly bioavailable drug composite particle that is taste-masked, and is less than 50 microns, i.e., smaller than the diameter of human hair.

The final output of the commercialization is a robust manufacturing platform that is applicable to any poorly water soluble drug and forming fast dissolving drug-composite small particles that can be used in chewable tablets, syrups, strip-films or lozenges, targeting patients having swallowing disorders, thus increasing patient compliance. As a reference, the majority of newly discovered drugs are almost insoluble in water; while the market for dysphagia alone is currently over $3B/year. 

The potential economic impact is expected to be well over $100M/year in the next five to fifteen years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the pharmaceutical sector, since nanostructured particulates are produced via methods that have scalability, reproducibility, low cost, and high-yield, and the products will have better bioavailability, are smaller and are essential components of next generation pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Such patients can be pediatric, geriatric or those with Alzheimer?s disease, which leads to dysphagia. Technology gap addressed in this project is the lack of scalable and economically feasible methods to produce highly bioavailable drug composite particles that do not have a gritty mouth-feel. The translated science based proof-of-concept has the following unique features: very fast drug availability after taking the medication even for poorly water soluble drugs; size small enough for incorporation into orally disintegrating dosages without gritty mouth-feel; and excellent flow and handing properties of the final nanocomposite particle.

The project combined several fundamentally based cutting-edge processes/approches to create a final composite (see figure): (1) Creating nanorough surfaces using solventless dry mechanical processing to make &lt; 50 micron highly water-soluble core particles (yellow core in the figure) that are easily fluidized; (2) Using electrosteric stabilization during size reduction to produce stable drug particle nanosuspensions and then spray coating fluidized core particles to create thin nanocomposite drug layer (grey shell in the figure); and (3) using another mechanical solventless film coating process to achieve taste-masking (outermost shell in the figure). Such composite particle is freely-flowable, small enough, and yet taste-masked while the drug is made available quickly in the body after swallowing. The proof-of-concept was validated using several well-known drugs that are practically water-insoluble. Through leveraged funding and collaboration, small animal testing was done on tablets formed containing these nanocomposite particles for a test drug, fenofibrate, which is used to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (Total-C), Triglycerides, and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

Higher education institutions have developed numerous programs and infrastructure to help faculty explore and realize the potential commercialization of their research. The National Science Foundation (NSF) and other federal programs along with private foundations and nonprofit organizations have supported efforts that strengthen the higher education entrepreneurial ecosystem and increasing commercialization of research. The US government invests $148 billion annually in basic research, more than any other country. While significant successes have resulted from this investment, a much greater opportunity exists to fully capitalize on this investment for the benefit of society. For university research to achieve greater impact, academic researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics need opportunities to learn how to evaluate whether their research discoveries have potential for commercialization.  For this reason, many organizations and universities have developed programs designed to accelerate the commercialization of university research. The proposed summit will bring together university leaders and researchers who seek to strengthen entrepreneurial ecosystems on their respective campuses and in the broader community. The meeting will provide opportunities for these faculty and institutional leaders to learn more about emerging programs and new resources that can help advance their institutional goals.

The summit participants will have the opportunity to learn about relevant services, resources and programs such as I-Corps, SBIR and PFI through discussion of successful program models that have emerged from these programs. NCIIA and the conference presenters will share the results of research on university technology entrepreneurship, and engage participants in discussion about how to develop new programming that supports the commercialization of funded research. Participants will be provided information about funding, training and networking opportunities and have the opportunity to discuss emerging needs and approaches to addressing them. Both the emerging needs and the solutions that emerge from these discussions will be captured and summarized in a white paper and video for dissemination. The summit is designed to increase participation in programs and networks supporting entrepreneurship education and commercialization. This will, in turn, increase the likelihood that commercializable research will emerge from U.S. colleges and universities, ideally leading to commercialization through translation and the creation of new ventures that evolve into viable businesses.",,,"In partnership with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, the University of Maryland, College Park, and The George Washington University, NCIIA convened a one-day workshop entitled, University Innovation Summit (UIS). The purpose of the Summit was to engage and inform the U.S. higher education community about technology commercialization and education programs, and how they can connect with other NCIIA and local entrepreneurship programs on their campuses.

The Summit brought together 95 faculty and institutional leaders from 64 colleges and universities in 28 states seeking to strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystems on their respective campuses and the broader community. The agenda provided opportunities for participants to learn more about emerging programs and new resources that can help advance institutional goals. Participants focused on the broad range of instruction, support resources and mentoring which I-Corps, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), and Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) provide to support university innovation and entrepreneurship, and identified successful projects and curriculum models that have emerged from these programs. Collaboration among participants achieved the objective of a highly productive meeting that produced useful ideas to inform NSF, NCIIA, and the participating institutions.

Coming out of the University Innovation Summit, participants from diverse academic institutions across the U.S. committed to:

Establishing an ecosystem for interdisciplinary collaborations that promote innovations to solve pressing global challenges.
Developing a mentor network and mentor programs to reach and serve universities located in more remote geographic areas and/or that may not identify as ""top-tier"" institutions.
Identifying and implementing strategies for retaining strong ties between engineering and design faculty who may move away from the university into industry, so that individuals professionally engaged outside academia continue to teach and train students working to commercialize and scale their research.
Working with other universities to secure an I-Corps Node grant for senior design projects and start-ups.
Identifying strategies for developing an entrepreneurial ""mindset"" among faculty and a team mentality across disciplines.


In the 24 months since the November 2012 convening of the University Innovation Summit, the national network of mentors and leaders -- from both academia and industry -- that the UIS participants envisioned has come to fruition. Beginning with the formational event made possible under this grant, there now exists a national network of 7 regional Nodes and 13 local Sites that scale and refine the vision and objectives of I-Corps; connect and engage stakeholders with each other; nurture network stewards/leaders; and enable Nodes and Sites to pilot strategies and work together. The network that has grown out of the University Innovation Summit extends the reach of I-Corps and leverages the community it has developed among people and organizations to create, use, and sustain an innovation ecosystem that enhances the development of technologies, products and processes to grow the U.S. economy and benefit society.

Production and utilization of butanol will be used in order to establish this new paradigm.  In particular, it has been shown that during the production of bio-butanol, which has the potential of combining production from renewable sources with almost-gasoline-level energy density, mixtures of butanol, ethanol, and acetone are produced, usually referred to as baelene.  These mixtures can clearly be used themselves as fuels, without the need to resort to pure bio-butanol.  In fact, the underlying biological processes can be controlled in order to produce the butanol/acetone/ethanol proportion that is optimal for the energy conversion process in the engine chamber.  The main objective of the research is to introduce a methodology that will control bio-fuel production processes through knowledge of the properties of the fuel mixture that relate to its atomization and combustion.  To this extent a characterization of baelene sprays will be performed as a function of its composition utilizing a novel Planar Droplet Sizing technique that will be based on the high acetone content of the fuels under consideration.  Also, novel atomization technologies will be developed that will be based on the increased electric conductivity of the bio-butanol containing mixtures, which paves the way for electrostatic manipulation of atomization and combustion.  Additionally, ignition delay and turbulent flame propagation will be measured in an accurately controlled combustion chamber for a wide range of fuel compositions.  The approach will be both experimental with the use of advanced, mostly laser-based diagnostics and computational with emphasis on modeling fuel properties and sprays and providing an extensive data base of high-quality data that will guide ?upstream? fuel production.

The research will establish an alternative to the currently dominant mentality in bio-fuel production which involves the production of well-defined chemicals (bio-ethanol, methyl-esters) that are required to operate in engines that have been designed for drastically different fuels.  Instead, a methodology will be developed that will take intermediate products of the biological processes, utilize them as fuels, optimize their composition for atomization and combustion performance, and then guide the biological process towards the production of optimized intermediates without the need to resort to pure chemicals.  In this manner, clean and efficient combustion of renewable fuels will be achieved with a reduced cost of processing the raw agricultural material.","Wu, H., Zhang, C., Li, B., Lee, T. H., and C.

In order to study the fundamental combustion characteristics of ABE, ABE-diesel blends with varying ABE content as well as different ABE compositions were combusted and investigated in a combustion chamber with optical access. ABE-diesel blends have shown enhanced air/fuel mixing due to higher volatility along with and ABE displayed one-third the soot formation tendency (natural flame luminosity) relative to diesel (and n-butanol) yet still maintaining similar combustion phasing. Overall, a medium ratio of ABE&ndash;diesel blends, (an ABE ratio between 20% and 50%), is able to maintain combustion characteristics similar to those of neat diesel and show great potential to enhance thermal efficiency and reduce soot emissions. Further, a comprehensive performance and emissions analyses in SI engines of various ABE-gasoline blends helped identify optimum ABE ratio for SI combustion in terms of high efficiency and low emissions. It was found that a small amount of ABE addition to gasoline (&lt;40%) can enhance thermal efficiency and reduce emissions. ABE-gasoline blends showed advanced combustion phasing and shorter combustion durations. Neat ABE blends were combusted in the SI engine and it was found that apart from ABE(3:6:1), fermentation products with higher acetone content, such as ABE(6:3:1) would also be suitable alternative fuels for SI engines. Water-containing ABE and gasoline blends, Isoproponal-butanol-ethanol (IBE)-gasoline blends, as well as acetone-ethanol blends were also investigated and showed positive impacts on efficiency and reductions in HC, CO and NOx. ABE was also investigated in diesel engines to further complement the combustion chamber studies. Results showed improved thermal efficiency even with a relatively small ABE blending ratio (&lt;20%). Addition of ABE showed retarded combustion phasing, but with optimized injection timing, showed much improved efficiency. Soot emissions were lower whereas NOx emissions were slightly higher for ABE-containing fuels at same load and timing conditions. Combustion models and numerical methods have been developed used In CFD combustion simulations of diesel and alternative fuels to efficiently predict the combustion characteristics, engine operation and formation of emissions. The experimental measurements were also used to validate a phenomenological soot model for ABE combustion and a semi-detailed ABE chemical kinetic mechanism built in the PI?s group. The computational work involved also led to the development of fast and efficient solver for resolving combustion kinetics. Overall, the project led to the affirmation of the potential of intermediate fermentation product in bio-butanol production, ABE, as an alternative fuel. Optimized ABE compositions were identified which could help modify the ABE fermentation process accordingly to efficiently produce products more applicable as fuels. In this manner, clean and efficient combustion of ABE can be achieved with a reduced cost of processing the raw agricultural material. The project has resulted in over 35 peer-reviewed publications in journals as well as international conferences. 5 graduate students, 3 with an M.S and 2 with a PhD, have graduated as a result of this project. Several students were educated on the merits and the potential of alternative fuels in an advanced engines class taught by the PI, enabling several opportunities for lateral thinking to develop new research ideas. One of the primary goals of the project was to recruit more women to be part of the STEM field and as such, 7 female students were recruited and trained in combustion experiments and modeling &ndash; one of whom has graduated with a doctorate degree in mechanical engineering. They have also published several publications in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences.

Recent work has demonstrated these materials to be promising building blocks for future clean energy devices, including wire grid polarizers for smart windows, anti-reflective coatings for solar cells and high surface area anodes for lithium-ion batteries. This activity built on the work of CNSE?s successes in highly controlled growth of nanowires, nanorods and nanopatterns at its unique nanofabrication facilities for building large area nanostructured devices, as well as leverage its broader incubation, commercialization and ""partnerships for innovation"" efforts, which focuses on connecting university-based research and development activities with private enterprise, funding and expertise; thereby helping increase the rate and scale of clean energy technology market penetration across the region and country. 

In the NSF AIR: ASPIRE program, CNSE worked with three companies in three technology areas: 1) High-performance silicon-based anodes for lithium ion batteries; 2) Advanced SiO2 nanorods as antireflective coatings for high efficiency solar cells; and 3) Large area nanopatterns applied to wire  grid polarizers for smart windows.  The program also worked with several other organizations in its outreach efforts.

The open innovation knowledge model used by CNSE is augmented with the addition of interactive interdisciplinary collaborations and sharing of information amongst the industrial partners and other information from resource providers. This accelerates the pace of commercialization through pilot prototyping and rapid scale-up of these important innovations. The selected partnerships match the small companies? technical innovation with CNSE?s top scientific capacity, research and innovation focus, and unique multi-disciplinary approach to commercialize novel clean energy technologies as well as breakthrough materials and systems.

Today's existing distribution transformer lacks the ability to send or receive signals, make decisions, regulate power flow, and easily accommodate green technology (including renewable generation). The SST changes this with the use of power electronics and is often assimilated with internet hubs, as information flows similarly and decisions are automatically made at this utility/customer intersection. 

Named as one of the top ten technologies that can change our life by MIT Technology Review in 2011, the SST is a smart device for integrating renewable energy, electric vehicle, and energy storage into the distribution grid. There is a significant interest to see that this technology is transferred to the market place to benefit U.S. industry and electric utilities. The SST is a critical component for microgrid environments and offers many potential features that will be required in the next generation distribution grid. The AIR project not only is to achieve a comprehensive and impressive list of SST functionalities in smart grid application, but also to do so with an innovative SST design at a cost acceptable to the market place.",,,"The project is to conduct translational research to speed up the insertion of a new technology into actual application. The project allowed a strategic alliance be formed between university, small business and large utility company. This close partnership resulted in a live demonstration of the technology. Therefore the scientific merit of the project is that advanced power electronics and control technology are verified through real world testing and demonstration. This technology can adds smart functions and capabilities to the century old electric grid. Another intellectual merit of the project is that it resulted in the speedy translation of the technology into the commercial world. Therefore the main object to speed up the commercialization of the technology is achieved.  The project also allowed students and postdocs be trained with mentorships from small business partner with a focused training in system engineering and real world issue solving. This is not otherwise possible in traditional single PI university only project.  A number of publications are published to disseminate the knowledge to large audience. The broader impact of the project includes enhancement of US leadership in smart grid technology. It also enables US electricity customers to save energy while allowing utility companies to use the electric grid better and integrate more renewable energies.

Potential sources of power include RF sources that are widely available, and for power harvesting applications.

For biosensing applications, Silicon nanowires in a special ""Wheatstone Bridge"" geometry were designed, fabricated and tested. The nanosensors were made using electron beam lithography and functionalized for the detection of specific biomarkers, including selected cancer biomarkers.

A new method for simlating nonlinear devices in the ultrahigh frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum was developed. With careful attention to geometry, an array of such nonlinear elements can provide enhnaced efficiency for still greater power transmission.

Located in north Texas, the CASA Dallas Fort Worth Living Lab for Severe Weather Warning Systems includes X-band radars and other sensors, computation and communications, weather products, decision support technologies, and engaged stakeholders. The warning system operates in real-time during severe weather outbreaks, disseminating weather information to almost 1,000 stakeholders and a growing group of the general public.

This award sought to 1) pilot a regionally-driven model for radar deployment that could be replicated in other areas in the United States through multi-sector partnerships; 2) conduct systems-level translational research to quantify the value of CASA warning systems to a variety of different stakeholders;  3) foster technology-level translational research of major sub-components of the CASA warning system, such as the radars, signal processing algorithms, and radar control architecture to start-ups and existing instrument manufacturers and suppliers; and 4) Involve students in translational research, business plan creation and market assessment.

Technology transfer outcomes include:

Development of high resolution flood warning systems for urban areas. Researchers prototyped a real time system that would help the cities: i) improve lead times for public works personnel responding to flash flood threats in the City of Ft. Worth, ii) improve accuracy for identifying and delineating flood risk areas for warnings and response for the public works personnel; and iii) improve communications strategies to promote timely public response. This information is currently being evaluated during real time events by city of Fort Worth and Grand Prairie stormwater managers. 
Commercial sales of X-band radars. Four private companies deployed their own x-band radars in the Living Lab to refine their technology with our engineers, obtain user feedback, and showcase  their technology. 23 new X-band radars have been sold into regional markets both in the US and internationally based on their experience in the living lab. 
Adoption of the regional radar deployment model.   A broadcast media company has made a major financial commitment to deploy X-band radars in urban markets across the country, based in part, on the CASA Living Lab. Radars are currently being deployed in Dallas, Chicago, LA, and the mid-Atlantic coast. 
Operational use of CASA radar data by National Weather Service office in Fort Worth.  CASA data is disseminated in real time to the NWS decision support system for use in real-time severe weather warnings.
Development of licensable version of the Meteorological Command and Control software for radar system operations and product generation; development of a prototype storm initiation product. 


Education and Outreach outcomes include:

Two entrepreneurship classes were offered at the University of North Texas under the project.  These students developed a feasibility assessment and a business plan for commercialization of CASA radars and related data services. The students also got an opportunity to engage with potential end customers of the technology and venture capitalists and students involved in the technical research for the project.  One post-doc participated in the I-corps project to evaluate potential for small scale radars. 
Research outcomes were published and presented at several domestic and international conferences, meetings with the National Weather Service personnel and local public safety officials such as emergency managers and storm water managers.
5 Masters or PhD theses were awarded based on research conducted in the the Living Lab.


 

Organizational outcomes include:

Development of a multi-sector partnership that will fund on-going research, technology transfer and operations for the CASA Dallas Fort Worth Living Lab for Severe Weather Warning Systems beyond the end of current award. Funders include the north Texas public safety community and the National Weather Service for network operations; industry and federal grants for sponsored research; and a private company that is providing broader institutional support. 
Active and growing practitioner partnerships. The project started with commitment and participation from just two private sector firms, but over time has grown to include participants from eleven weather data resellers, eleven small and large local businesses that get impacted by weather, eight weather sensor manufacturers and two disaster relief non-profits.  
Strategic Partnerships with European Network for Living Labs (ENOLL) and The Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC), a collaborative network of  ""Action Clusters,"" working on groundbreaking applications of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies within the smart city/community environment.  These associations will connect us in the future to like-minded organizations, partners, funding sources, and new ideas.

These technologies are: (i) millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular systems that can move cellular communication to new bands between 20 and 120 GHz where between 50 and 100 times more spectrum are readily available; (ii) relaying and distributed coordination techniques to enable ultra low-cost small, self-organizing cells that increase the numbers of cell sites by orders of magnitude; and (iii) full duplex communication that can double communication bandwidth and facilitate beamforming techniques essential for mmWave cellular systems.

Given the enormous market size of the cellular industry ($1 trillion worldwide), combined with the pressing need for solutions to solve the spectrum crunch, the breakthrough technologies in this proposal will offer tremendous market value, return on investment, and opportunities for employment.

The goal of this project is to increase the capacity of today?s 4G wireless cellular networks by over 1000 times through the use of above 20GHz (millimeter waves) spectrum and full duplex radios that allow radios to transmit and receive at the same time.
?
Until recently, the prevailing assumption was that mobile service in higher frequency bands was infeasible because radio waves at those frequencies could only provide only line-of-sight service. Our measurements study at 28 and 73 GHz demonstrate that these new frequencies hold potential far beyond what experts had expected. The measurement data indicates the feasibility of mmWave cellular networks, which has now brought in a large number of companies (Qualcomm, Intel, Ericsson, NSN, etc) into the field.
?
On October 17, 2014, the FCC decided to explore the feasibility and implementation of high-frequency radio waves in the millimeter-wave spectrum through a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) (http://www.fcc.gov/document/noi-examine-use-bands-above-24-ghz-mobile-broadband) . NYU's groundbreaking research sponsored by this funding has been instrumental in the Federal Communications Commission?s decision.
?
The team showed a high-level system design for introducing mmWave radios into next-generation LTE cellular standards, and estimated the network capacity based on the real-world measurement data. We also demonstrated the first LTE-like waveform transmissions on mmWave band using National Instrument?s radio platform.
?
We finished a study on the feasibility study on the full duplex operations on cellular systems. We observe that, with smart use of channel resources allocation and interference mitigation methods, full duplex transmission has the potential to double the capacity of existing cellular systems.
?
Throughout the project period, we have been working closely with our industry partners, including Asension (full-duplex radio frequency front-end design), InterDigital (which develops wireless technologies for mobile devices and networks), National Instruments (testing equipment) and Verizon (mobile network operator), which represent the entire innovation chain in the wireless industry. ?After the project started, several new industrial affiliates, including Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm, and StraightPath, joined NYU-Wireless center to develop millimeter wave technology.
?
NYU has been recognized at the forefront of 5G research. The team hosted two Brooklyn 5G Summit conferences, which brings together wireless/mobile industry R&D leaders in academia and business to discuss trends, aimed at discovering what will be the best ways to take the first steps towards understanding 5G wireless technologies.?

To correlate quantitatively non-destructive measurements to dissolution performance. To advance Real Time Release Testing (RTRT) by developing new analytical methods that enhance the quality assessment and control and reduces the costs of health-care treatment and product manufacturing associated with large captive waiting-for-release inventories and failed batches. And to use the eco-system to provide a vehicle for convergent technology development to enable the paradigm of Real Time Release Testing (RTRT) for continuous manufacturing of pharmaceutical products that offers significant commercial opportunities, attracts investors and technology developers, and accelerates the rate of technology transfer of scientific research.

Attending to these goals, the project impacted the formation of an industry-academic partneship, expanding the scope from RTRT to under complementary areas of Pharamaceutical Manufacturing. Some of the distinctive elements of this partnership include:

1) Participation of end-users that provide the drivers for technology development. In this context the end-users are pharmaceutical companies. Indeed, the efforts of our main partner Johnson &amp; Johnson evolved into a more comprehensive strategic plan for implementing methodologies developed during this AIR project with the ultimate goal of achieving RTR for their specific products.

2) Participation of technology providers, which are usually companies with proprietary technology solutions and the corresponding technical expertise. In the context of this AIR program, we have engaged several technoloigy providers including Advantest (terahertz technology), Middleton Reseach (spectral visrion) and Bosch (inline tablet testing). We are envisioning the participation other complementary equipment providers such as Glatt, Gericke, Schenk, K-Tron, GEA, Instrument and sensor vendors such as VTT, Specim, Visiotech, Innopharma, and software and control companies such as PES, Werum, Emerson, and Siemens. These companies can usually provide a partial solution and lack the ability to respond to integrated technological challenges. They need complementary providers to tackle such solutions. The AIR program provided the environment for forming these alliances that benefits both the end-users as well as the technology providers. Operating within the ecosystem, this set of companies are in the process of modifying some manufacturing equipment for continuous operation, designing improved instruments and sensors, optimizing them for the specific task at hand, testing the control algorithms under real life production conditions, and providing multiple products whose characteristics and manufacturing challenges require this more advanced approach and will work with the academic component and the FDA to adjust the regulatory framework to enable this set of advances.

3) Participation of academia to address the technological and scientific challenges presented by specific needs. The role of academia becomes part of the critical path for introducing innovation on technology development cycle interacting directly with the technology providers while accelerating the tech transfer to the market place.

4) Early interaction with the regulatory agencies to quantify the impact of new technologies on assessement and predition of oral dosage prodcuts, reduding the uncertainly of the acceptance of new technologies. FDA has expressed interest in our case study in continuous manufacturing also initiated a project on modeling towards RTR.

The intent is for the tool to run on commonly available systems (supporting both desktops as well as laptops that might be used in the field), needing no more than recently collect imager to process.  A user will examine one typical image and identify for the tool a particular target based on simple matches of color and tolerance properties.  Using standard and well-established supervised image classification techniques, this tool will then proceed to locate similar targets in all other images across a large area, as directed by the user.  The work will address the important question of how to provide useful information to onsite responders to disasters and emergencies, when the specific questions and the type of information that is useful are dependent upon local events and circumstances.  

A prototype of the algorithm has already shown that it can locate encampments of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Haiti disaster environment using imagery from the RIT Wildfire Airborne Sensing Program (WASP),an airborne imaging system, utilized during seven days of flyovers (January 21-27, 2010) of the earthquake ravaged areas for Haiti funded by the World Bank. In the context of the 1TB of data collected during the Haiti flyovers, the project will be able construct an end-user tool and evaluate its usefulness, and, by proxy, the usefulness of similar analytical tools in an operational environment. In the near term, this automated tool can be provided to responders on the ground so that food, water, and medicine can be brought to the internally displaced persons (IDPs), thus contributing to meeting the urgent needs onsite in Haiti.",,,"The basis for this project was consideration of the results of a major data collection that was conducted by RIT over Haiti following the January 12, 2010 earthquake. The World Bank had contracted with the RIT Information Products Laboratory for Emergency Response (IPLER) partners ImageCat Inc. and RIT's Laboratory for Imaging Algorithms and Systems to collect high quality aerial multi-spectral imagery and LIDAR information over the affected area to aid in the relief effort.  The data collection produced over 1.1 TB of raw imagery data from 15,191 images x 4 cameras = 60,764 total images, and 131 GB of raw LIDAR scan data from over 2.9 Billion LIDAR returns. 


The major activities of this project were to review the collection, analysis and dissemination process and to consider how such high-value data could be made available to decision-makers and responders in the field. These considerations led to the development of a set of base assumptions and recommendations for the requirements of a system which would have the capability to meet the information needs of responders with the kind of interaction and time-frame that would be important for effective response. 





A system that has the capability to support a heterogeneous group of responders at a disaster site as well as a network of supervisors and planners from diverse agencies at remote locations is faced with challenging requirements. From the responders perspective, any field system must be easy to use, have modest computing demands, an intuitive and natural user interface that can be used by someone with minimal training, and with timely and useful data available. When data are collected remotely, such as by satellite, aircraft, or by users who are spread out over the landscape, there is a need to collect and organize diverse sources and then provide users with high-quality products. Low bandwidth and intermittent communications are to be expected in disaster arenas. However, the raw data are likely to be gathered in large quantities, with hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes not unusual. This needs to be gathered organized, analyzed in a manner that is appropriate for different responder missions, and then the essential information products delivered in a timely and useful manner.

It is recommended that consideration be given to further research targeted at the issues of widely scattered and intermittent data collection, the need for sophisticated and integrated analysis, and the need to communicate many kinds of information products to a heterogeneous collection of responders who possess only basic communication and display tools. Successful development of a framework for such systems could lead to high payoff in terms of faster and more effective response in confusing disaster situations.

Heaven and his research group at Emory University are investigating the unusual bonding mechanisms of the element beryllium (Be). A common type of chemical bond is called a covalent single bond, where two electrons are shared by two atoms, each atom of the pair typically contributing one electron to the bond.  Beryllium atoms are unusual in that they often form what are called dative covalent bonds, where both bonding electrons are provided by the other atom.  The Heaven research group is using specialized lasers and mass spectrometers to characterize the structure and properties of small molecules containing Be and other metal atoms (e.g., BeLi,  LiBeLi, Li4Be2, where ""Li"" is a lithium atom).  The chemistry of beryllium is underexplored due to its toxicity.  However, Be and its compounds exhibit unique and useful properties. For example, beryllium alloys are used as lightweight structural materials due to their exceptional strength to weight ratios. The remarkable durability of the metal is reflected by the fact that it is used as a plasma facing material in fusion reactors.  This research project is providing new insights into chemical bonding in general, as well as data that can be used to test new theories on bonding and help in the prediction of the properties of new Be compounds for new technological applications.  The graduate students engaged in this project are gaining experience in both experimental and theoretical chemistry.  Undergraduate students from the Atlanta University Center Consortium (AUCC) institutions are also involved in the project. This successful collaboration with AUCC institutions provides research opportunities for undergraduate students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Undergraduate researchers are not only receiving technical training related to Be chemistry, but also developing soft skills, such as networking, manuscript preparation and oral presentation of research results.

At present, the experimental data needed to evaluate quantum chemical models for beryllium are lacking. This validation is needed to establish confidence in the computational methods used to identify compounds with valuable physical and chemical properties. Experimental studies of prototypical beryllium compounds are the primary objectives of this research. Spectroscopic techniques, including laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and pulsed-field ionization-zero electron kinetic energy (PFI-ZEKE) are being applied to gas phase molecules and ions to obtain structural and thermodynamic properties. The species being examined, including LiBe (and ions LiBe(+), LiBe(-)) and LiBeLi are chosen because they have been the subjects of high-level theoretical investigations in the Heaven laboratory and by others. In addition to the experimental spectroscopic work, this project employs computational studies that utilize complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI).  The research provides the graduate and undergraduate students, and post-doctoral associates involved with a rich experience in advanced experimental and theoretical methods.

Electrical grids currently require demand and supply of electricity to be exactly balanced in real time to avoid power disruption and blackouts. This is a challenging task, and growing efforts to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources create additional problems for grid resilience and energy security. Large-scale energy storage integrated into an electrical grid enables utility companies to effectively manage unwanted fluctuations and provides the flexibility required for widespread implementation of renewable sources. Furthermore, these systems have additional benefits in their utilization for peak shaving and load leveling applications. The energy stored when demand is low can be used to compensate excessive load during peaks. This practice has economic benefit for electricity consumers and providers.

This I-Corps project explores commercial application opportunities for high-stability, bio-inspired non-aqueous redox flow battery (NRFB) systems with high cell-voltage, high current density and low capacity-fade for the grid-scale energy storage market. State-of-the-art NRFB systems are limited by decomposition of active materials and the related significant capacity-fade after minimal cycling. The flow battery electrolytes we plan to commercialize solve the problem of active material instability that has prevented commercialization of NFRBs by utilizing metal chelators, the biosynthesis of which evolved naturally by mushrooms in the Amanita genus. These molecules have been optimized for stability by millions of generations of natural selection and exhibit very strong metal-binding that shuts down decomposition pathways. Preliminary results have shown that the introduced bio-inspired approach has the potential to address the critical problems, such as low cyclability and poor performance in commercialization of NRFB systems.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,"This I-Corps project aimed at exploring commercialization opportunities for high-stability, bio-inspired non-aqueous redox flow battery (NRFB) systems with high cell-voltage, high current density and low capacity-fade for the grid-scale energy storage market. To achieve this main objective, the major goals of this project are to conduct customer interviews and market assessment analysis, identify and better understand target customer segments, and ultimately develop a lean business canvas.

Insights from the I-Corps interviews offered important perspectives on the proposed technology and helped us pivot from our original intended market of smaller scale stationary storage systems, including telecommunication tower and microgrid applications, and village-based peak demand shifting in third world countries. Through the customer discovery activities, we preliminarily identified solar+storage as an attractive niche market for flow battery companies, especially in the U.S., where solar power and energy storage will continue to have a symbiotic relationship. Ultimately, the wide-scale adoption of solar electricity generation will lead to increased use of storage, which will in turn lead to additional deployment opportunities. Since project owners and developers in this field have started to consider using flow batteries in their projects, this is an attractive market for our electrolyte.

Based on the interviews during the I-Corps customer discovery process, we have identified that aqueous vanadium redox flow batteries can largely address the safety and recyclability issues of lithium-ion batteries. However, they are expensive due to the required high-purity vanadium-based electrolytes, which can represent more than 35 % of the VRFB system cost at scale. This number can go up to 50% for a 1MW system with 4h capacity. The proposed electrolyte technology can solve this problem using the vanadium selectivity of the introduced active material. Not only does the active material exhibit the strongest vanadium binding ever measured, it does so with high-selectivity, binding other metals with much lower affinity. One of the novelties of the technology lies in making use of this strong, highly specific vanadium binding to synthesize the proposed electrolyte from low-grade, thus low- or negative-cost vanadium sources.

Other key outcomes and achievements are listed as follows:



1) The team has successfully developed an initial lean business canvas which is constantly being revised.

2) The team has initiated talks with major players in the flow battery business (both national and international companies) to integrate the proposed family of high-stability electrolytes into their flow battery product lines.



3) The team was received an SBIR Award from the Department of Energy in collaboration with a local small business. The high-stability and related long-term performance the proposed electrolytes were leveraged to test the effectiveness of the membranes developed by the collaborator company for non-aqueous redox flow battery applications.



4) The team has recently applied for an NSF PFI-TT grant to develop a prototype based on the outcomes of this I-Corps program.

In response to increasing demand for new types of jobs, degree programs such as Computational Genomics and Music Technology have combined fields that have historically been distinct.  This project enables students to discover both traditional and emerging majors relevant to them. By providing actionable insights and better alignment of interests early on, this decreases the friction of changing majors (~80% currently) during college and begins to mitigate widespread lack of engagement (~70%) in the workplace.  Compared with traditional methods that match GPAs, test scores, unstructured essays, and resumes, with schools, majors, and job openings, this project could revolutionize the way students identify, train and prepare for their future careers.

This I-Corps project is based on a novel patent-pending technology of a unified multi-dimensional data representation method called Skills Genome. Skills Genome can be exploited by several machine learning models, allowing for capturing and modeling complex student data inputs such as critical thinking, communication, interests, leadership, etc. with temporal graphs.  By making the structure of the graph accessible to several machine learning models, the method improves accuracy, relevance and facilitates scale.  Specifically, this tracks the student?s development timeline, so they can best determine the timing and sequencing of skills needed for their chosen careers.  Further, by matching profiles at scale, new insights into potential careers can be surfaced, along with the next steps needed to achieve them.

The interviews included users, payers, partners, and influencers. Over the 7 weeks, we received critical mentoring and feedback from the weekly I-Corp team to help us hone in on the product-market fit. We continued our customer discovery (over 70 additional customer interviews) and refined our hypothesis and further iterated our hypothesis testing beyond the 7 weeks, which has been monumental in defining the business model, the value proposition, and clarity on our personas of the payers and users. As we approach the end of the I-Corp program, we have been encouraged to apply for the NSF PFI grant to build out the prototype in addition to applying for the NSF SBIR.The overall positive experience of the National NSF I-Corp program has set the team to be competitive in being accepted into UC Berkeley?s technology start-up incubator, and applying for dilutive and non-dilutive funding sources. Epixego?s team is clearer about the pain points, the clarity of customer segments, the value proposition for users and payers, and influencers and partners in this ecosystem. These learnings would not have been possible without the support ofNSF I-Corp program and the change in structured thinking that this program enabled beyond theduration of the program. The program has also been a strong validation of the break-throguh technology that the team is working on and the potential commercial benefit. Ms. Grace Wong continues to be our informal mentor and supporter of the company and team.

Human beings are continuously attacked by viruses, bacteria, and microbes populating the air, water, and soil. It makes people sick and, in some cases, the illness becomes lethal. Special care needs to be taken for immunity deficient people in hospitals who are recovering from sickness or surgery. The 2011 report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that approximately 722,000 patients in hospitals acquired additional infection and had to stay extra ~18 days for treatment. It resulted in additional $30 billion cost to US taxpayers. While it is relatively easy to disinfect floors, ceilings, desks, and other flat and even surfaces in hospital rooms by DUV light, there are hard-to-reach and shadowed areas that require special attention. Our team believes that advent of DUV LED integrated with remotely controlled robotic platforms can provide efficient disinfection of shadowed areas and thus reduce the number of HAI cases. We are in the midst of discussion of testing our robotic prototypes with the administration of the Health Division of Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians tribe. It is a great opportunity for publicizing   modern health care technologies among Native Americans. HAI is a global problem. In the past the United States was a leader in developing cutting edge technologies in medicine, telecommunication, defense, and aero-space industries. It is therefore vitally important for the US industry to keep producing new high-tech products. If an US team can show the path of controlling HAI it will definitely have a global impact. 

This I-Corps project is based on the discoveries from an ongoing NSF-DMREF project. Our findings have shed light on how to overcome the major factors that limit the performance of DUV LEDs. In the research space a few unique properties of the PIs invented LEDs have been demonstrated: a) improved efficiency of light generation in ultra-thin GaN quantum wells, b) better light extraction efficiency, c) enhanced efficiency of carrier injection into quantum wells, and d) capability of LEDs to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Two provisional patent applications have been filed so far to protect the research outcome. Moving forward, our team has built a prototype by integrating commercial DUV LEDs with an autonomous robot to ensure human free disinfection of hospital rooms. It should be able to reach hard-to-access areas like space under beds and tables. We foresee that unique properties of our LEDs will reduce energy consumption by 5 times and enhance lifetime of LEDs. It will also lower the operating cost, improve disinfection of shadowed areas, and guarantee the absence of mercury, commonly found in mercury lamps, to ensure the absence of disposal problems.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,"I-Corps is a great program which allowed us to take a walk into the ""real world"" and learn if our academic research is worth a penny. At Cornell University we focused on fabrication of miniature devices for high power, high speed electronics, low energy consumption electronics, electro-mechanical hybrids, and optoelectronic devices. Prototyping efficient light emitting diodes (LEDs) in the UV-C range (100-280 nm) is one of our research project. The UV-C light is harmful for viruses and bacteria and we decided to look for a niche application of such on disinfection market. Under I-Corps program we interviewed 119 people from hospitals, clinics, and disinfection companies. More than 100 interviews were face-to-face, 15-30 minutes long.

Keeping infections under control is a huge problem for the US health care facilities; every year more than 1 million Americans get infected in hospitals and ~100,000 cases are fatal. The total financial burden of $35-45 billion due to health care acquired infections (HAI) is not covered by insurance companies and it significantly depletes hospital budget. Because of the wide scope of the problem, any small improvement in reduction of HAI rates will result in big savings in lives and finances.

The following findings are important for us:

   a) Currently the niche for application of exclusively UV-C LEDs in health care facilities is relatively small. Low efficiency of modern UV-C LEDs makes them commercially problematic venture but everybody in health care industry is waiting for the advent of efficient LEDs,

   b) We found a niche for UV-C disinfection of medium size medical devices, such as EKG, bladder scanners, weight scales, blood pressure meters, etc. Those devices migrate in hospitals on a daily basis from room-to-room and sometimes transport infections between patients. Continuing the efforts for commercialization of our research we are pursuing now the same under recently awarded NSF PFI-TT project. We believe that combination of UV-C lamps and UV-C LEDs can reduce cross-contamination of hospital rooms by dangerous microbes. If our project goes well we might come up with a disinfection device which will preserve $300,000 - 400,000 per year for each US hospital.

Our other thoughts:

   a) In majority of hospitals there is a significant shortage in service maintenance workforce who is doing rooms and medical devices cleaning. Because of shortage, service personnel has to clean everything under huge time pressure and it results that often up to 50% surfaces are not cleaned and disinfected. In cases when hospitals or clinics are well staffed, and compliance with cleaning protocols is high, there is no any apparent need for UV-C devices. These conclusions were supported by interviews with infection prevention officers from Saudi Arabia hospital, VA hospital in Ohio, and medical center in the New York, and

   b) Hospitals are not a place for leisure. Therefore ranking them by patient satisfaction seems to us as an improper idea. If circumstances require patient?s isolation with limited access of relatives and friends, let it be. If hospital infection prevention team asks for strong compliance with hand and overall hygiene, visitors need to comply thoroughly and willingly with protocols. If doctors limit patient's freedom to walk into hallways or to friends in other rooms, patients need to understand that those restrictions are for everyone?s well-being. Any complains related to hygiene, treatment rules, or hospital administration ""dictatorship"" have to be removed from evaluations of hospital performance.

On our side we will try to implement our research and engineering skills for reducing infection rate in hospitals, clinics, and long term care facilities.

This is a field that has not seen any new imaging agents come to market in ~25 years.  Current stress tests rely on a particular formulation of Technetium, a radioisotope, to image the heart at rest and at peak stress.  This current clinical standard, Technetium Sestamibi, goes to multiple organs other than the heart leading to poor image quality due to high signal to noise ratio as well as increasing radiation exposure.  By using a Cardiac Targeting Peptide (CTP) we can target the radiation to only where it is needed for imaging, thereby improving image quality, reducing false positive results and decreasing radiation exposure by as much as 80%.  We have chosen a radioisotope as our first cargo due to the widespread use of stress testing contributing to the highest radiation exposure in medical care, and due to a reasonable length of time/expense to FDA approval. This is scratching the surface of CTP's potential and once we can provide proof of concept in the human imaging application, the path will open for multiple other applications.  

	This I-Corps project is based on a novel, non-naturally occurring, 12-amino acid cell penetrating peptide that we termed Cardiac Targeting Peptide or CTP due to its ability to enter heart cells after a peripheral intravenous injection.  Both cardiac diagnostics and therapeutics suffer from a lack of vectors specifically targeting the heart.  Our work utilizing phage display identified CTP which we believe is a viable solution.  In our biodistribution studies, the peak uptake occurred at 15 mins, illustrating that CTP would be a useful vector in acute cardiac conditions like myocardial infarction in which the window of opportunity is limited to  ~6 hours. We were able to show this targeting activity in mouse heart, ex-vivo explanted human heart tissue from patients undergoing heart transplants and in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, demonstrating that CTPs ability to enter heart cells is not species limited and has human applicability.  We have labeled CTP with a radioisotope, Technetium 99m, using a chelator Hydrazinonicotinamide and delivered the radiation to the heart with minimal or no uptake by other organs.  We have also demonstrated that CTP is able to internalize bigger cargo into heart cells like the biotin-streptavidin complex.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,"Our prior work using a large phage library to screen for peptides targeting the normal mouse heart identified a small, 12-amino acid long, non-naturally occurring peptide, that we termed Cardiac targeting Peptide or CTP, due to it's ability to be internalized into normal heart cells after an intravenous injection, with peak uptake occurring as early as 15 minutes. Our proposal was to use CTP as a ""trojan horse"" to deliver radioisotopes to the heart for imaging purposes. For this purpose we obtained NSF iCORP funding to explore the commercialization potential of our idea. Although there was interest in CTP as a novel vector, imaging was felt to be of low interest by multiple stake-holders. We conducted ~230 customer discovery interviews which revealed that delivery of therapies specifically to the heart would be of much greater commercialization potential. Further, it became apparent that Amiodarone, an established and very effective anti-arrhythmic (drugs that fix rhythm problems of the heart) is under-utilized due to it's side effects with long-term use. Amiodarone is especially under-utilized in the younger adult population and pediatric age groups due to significant eye, thyroid, lung and liver toxicities associated with years of use. Some of these toxicities, especially lung and liver, can be irreversible and become life-threatening. Hence, we pivoted from our original idea of using CTP for diagnostic purposes to employing it as a novel vector to deliver Amiodarone specifically to the heart. By delivering the drug where it is needed to exert it's effects in an organ-specific manner, we hope to significantly reduce the dose of Amiodarone utilized and minimize it's off-target toxicities. 

As follow-up to the NSF iCORP porogram, we have launced a startup, Vivasc Therapeutics Inc., applied for further funding through the NSF's partners for innovation (PFI-TT) award as well as a Phase I STTR through the NHLBI.

The conference includes papers on many technologies that are fundamental to the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program and the smart systems aspect of the Partnership For Innovation: Broadening Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) program, including smart and connected communities, pervasive computing, and social computing. This project will fund 10-15 students to attend the conference.  A selection committee will be established and will make travel award decisions.  Selection criteria include the impact of attendance on future student research, support for women and unrepresented minorities, as well as participation from institutions that are frequently unable to attend these conferences.

The conference will organize a PhD Forum for students and will provide important networking opportunities for the students. The attendance and participation in conference activities including the PhD Forum and student sessions will have strong impact on the education of the next generation of pervasive computing and cyber-physical system experts.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,"The IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP) is a high quality conference in the emerging area of smart computing dealing with smart and connected communities. The NSF funds helped support 24 US-based students to attend IEEE SMARTCOMP 2018 conference held in Sicily, Italy on June 18-20, 2018 (www.smart-comp.org) and IEEE SMARTCOMP 2019 conference held in Washington, DC on June 12-14, 2019. Ten of these students were women and three under-represented minority. They consisted of a mix of undergraduate, MS and PhD students from small schools to big name schools in the US.
 
Intellectual Merit: Smart computing is an emerging multidisciplinary area that can be broadly classified into two major topics: how to design and build smart computing systems, and how to use computing technology for resource sustainability to improve the human experience. Applications of smart computing span a wide variety of business areas including, but not limited to, smart cities, transportation, energy, healthcare, security, banking, disaster management, and social media. The advancement of cloud computing, mobile/pervasive computing, cyber-physical systems, wireless sensor networking and social computing are bringing smart computing to a newer dimension and improving mankind's quality living. Papers presented at IEEE SMARTCOMP 2018 and 2019 as well as associated workshops were of high quality. In addition to technical paper presentations, the conference program included high quality keynote talks, exciting panel discussions, Ph.D. forum, and demo sessions. Extended versions of selected papers from this conference were invited for publication in Elsevier?s Pervasive and Mobile Computing (PMC) journal with high impact factor. The conference technical program discussed new directions of research in Smart and Connected Communities including smart cities, smart cyber-physical systems, smart healthcare, smart grid, smart transportation, internet of things (IoT), security, energy and sustainability.
 
Broader Impacts. Without NSF travel support, many of the US-based students would not otherwise have attended this excellent conference in the emerging field of smart computing. The funds supported 24 students including 10 women and 3 under-represented minority students, as well as a mix of undergraduate, master's and Ph.D. students. The students also got an opportunity to network with peers, and additionally were motivated to pursue academic and industry research careers upon graduation.

Each year in the United States around 120 million tons of coal combustion products (e.g., fly ash and bottom ash) are generated of which 37% is reused. This has led to a large historical stock of unused coal ash stored in on-site surface impoundments, which constitute a risk to the environment and human health and requires annual budget allocation to construct and maintain these facilities. Production of LWA from unused bottom ash will result in conversion of waste material to value-added product that can attract concrete and geotechnical markets. The produced LWA can be used as an aggregate in (a) structural lightweight concrete production, (b) internal curing of concrete, (c) production of concrete masonry blocks for buildings, retaining walls and landscape, (d) production of thermal/sound insulating concrete units, and (e) lightweight fill for highways, bridge abutments, retaining walls, foundations, and green roofs. The industries that will benefit this technology are electric power (to manage coal ash), aggregate, concrete, and geotechnical industries. 

 

Through conducting 129 interviews in this project, it is found that accessibility to construction LWA is becoming increasingly challenging for concrete and geotechnical industries in the US due to difficulties in (1) accessibility in different regions, (2) increasing market demands, and (3) shipment costs due to distance from the quarry to site. Synthetic LWA is a growing industry and its market alone is a $5+ billion industry per year in the US. Unfortunately, LWA manufacturers are available in few locations in the US due to their dependency to raw material mines. During this project, it is found that ready-mixed concrete producers in Pennsylvania (PA) and New Jersey (NJ) are required to import LWA from upstate New York (NY) or North Carolina (NC) spending $15-25/ton for shipment cost (20-35% of LWA original price). Considering the fact that bottom ash is abundantly available in most regions in the US, the produced LWA from bottom ash can be then marketed in concrete and/or geotechnical industries.

 

The customer discovery conducted in this project reveals that large-size ready-mixed and precast concrete producers with more than 100 cubic yard of concrete production per day (it is $50+ million/year market size for our LWA only in PA) are appropriate customers for the LWA produced from bottom ash. A commercialization pathway is also defined during this project as (1) addressing technological hurdles through a PFI-TT work, (2) establishing a start-up company, (3) partnering with waste glass based LWA company for low-cost large-scale production of our LWA, and (3) discussing the technology with potential companies for future investments and partnerships to find a desirable location and possible funding sources to establish our LWA production plant.

 

This project has led to significant understanding of market size and potential of LWA produced from waste bottom ash. Bottom ash has high residual carbon and the innovative sintering technology is to use this residual carbon with appropriate fluxing agent to create a porous material encapsulated by a glassy layer that exhibits pozzolanic reactivity. This novel material will possess an active amorphous surface and an inert crystalline porous interior in a controlled ratio. The technology uses a thermodynamic model and can target a wide range of bottom coal ashes with various physical conditions and chemical compositions. This innovative technology, however, has never been tested or evaluated for marketability potential or commercialization purposes. Through this intense I-Corps project, the team has (1) obtained deep understanding of the commercial impact and market size of this innovative technology and (2) validated the hypothesis that this innovative technology has the potential to attract stakeholders and customers in ready mixed concrete industry for a sustainable alternative solution to produce synthetic LWA from waste materials.

In manufacturing, sound-based condition monitoring coupled with data-driven maintenance can help significantly reduce unscheduled work stoppages, faulty products and waste of raw materials. Building management systems can be augmented by integrating real-time condition updates for critical machinery such as HVAC units, elevators, boilers and pumps, minimizing disruption for managers and users of those services. This technology is flexible, accurate and data-driven, potentially providing a low barrier to adoption for prospective customers and adaptability to various markets. Beyond predictive maintenance, applications include noise level monitoring for ensuring compliance in workplaces and airports, home and building security, early alert for traffic accidents, bio-acoustic monitoring of animal species, and outdoor noise monitoring at scale for improved enforcement in smart cities.

This I-Corps project further develops research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and the internet of things. The technology consists of a calibrated and highly accurate acoustic sensor with embedded sound recognition AI based on deep learning.  Sound conveys critical information about the environment that often cannot be measured by other means. In manufacturing, early stage machinery malfunction can be indicated by abnormal acoustic emissions. In smart homes and buildings, sound can be monitored for signs of alarm, distress or compliance.  Sound sensing is omnidirectional and robust to occlusion and contextual variables such as lightning conditions at different times of the day. Many existing solutions cannot identify different types of sounds or complex acoustic patterns, making them unsuited for these applications. This solution is both low cost and capable of identifying events and sources at the network edge, thus eliminating the need for sensitive audio information to be transmitted.",,,"Our I-Corps team attended all of the Los Angeles 2017 fall cohort activities, gaining a wealth of valuable experience in all aspects of commercialization and entrepreneurship. These intense meetings and online seminars involved: training sessions on lean startup methodologies, conducting in-person customer interviews followed by the reporting/assessment of our findings and business model canvas developments. This training was put into practice when the team participated in the NYU Stern $300K Entrepreneurs Challenge, finishing as finalists in the Technology Venture track. This helped us hone our pitching skills in front of investors, and continue the development of our BMC through customer interviews.
Throughout the project period, we completed over 300 interviews, with over 200 in-person, across many sectors as we developed our BMC. We also attended six trade shows, visited several industrial facilities, connected with professional associations and other influencers, analyzed industry surveys by trade publications, and spoke to potential competitors. We interviewed people from many industries on our journey to uncover product/market fit, including: the service industry, HVAC systems, oil &amp; gas, energy, manufacturing, and automotive. Based on our findings from these we settled on the manufacturing industry, which was further refined to the pulp and paper industry (PPI). In this group, we interviewed representatives from more than a dozen companies including four of the top ten largest pulp/paper manufacturers and converters in the world, who account for 20% of global PPI revenue. We spent a significant amount of time focussed on the manufacturing companies within the PPI and had decided on the following value proposition:
""Providing Engineering Managers in the pulp and paper industry with an integrated solution for automatic, continuous condition monitoring of manufacturing machinery, resulting in annual savings of $17.5M, downtime reductions of 5%, ROI within 4 days, a 5x decrease in monitoring costs, and increases in alert lead-time to failure by 2 weeks.""
After attending two PPI technology trade shows, our attention shifted to paper machinery OEMs. After more than 50 interviews with relevant PPI stakeholders, it became clear that OEMs were a viable customer segment and would be in a better position to adopt the solutions we were proposing. This customer segment provides a path to many operational PPI machines via their customer?s plants across the US. Another benefit of OEMs is that the machinery range is small, allowing us to develop machine learning models that can be specialised for their machines, lowering the technical challenges for us.
With this new understanding, we were successful in applying for a National Science Foundation, Partnerships For Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) award. The proposal was based on the findings from our customer discovery and business model development activities carried out throughout the I-Corps process and the NYU Venture Competition. This award is allowing us to research and develop a minimum viable product for an acoustic machine condition monitoring solution for the industrial internet of things. A patent was also created during this process entitled: System, Method And Computer&shy; Accessible Medium For Machine Condition Monitoring (application #16/750,378).

Areas that will benefit from their commercialization include organic synthesis, bioconjugation, nanotechnology, pharmaceutical chemistry and more. Currently, monodisperse short PEGs can be prohibitively expensive. Many scientists have to devote significant time to synthesize them or have to use less ideal alternative materials. More seriously, there is no technology to synthesize monodisperse long PEGs and scientists in the pharmaceutical industry often use impure PEGs for drug PEGylation (i.e. tagging with PEG).  Commercialization of affordable monodisperse PEGs and their derivatives may transform the ways researchers and manufacturers conduct their projects.

This I-Corps project explores the market potential of novel technologies that can be used to synthesize polyethylene glycols (PEG) and derivatives in monodisperse form and with much lower costs. Short PEGs are widely used as linkers in areas including organic synthesis, and pharmaceutical chemistry. Long PEGs are used for PEGylating pharmaceuticals to increase water solubility and bio-stability, and to reduce undesirable immune responses and dosing frequency. Currently monodisperse short PEGs can be synthesized via stepwise organic synthesis. However, the process requires chromatography to purify intermediates and product, which consumes large volumes of solvents and silica gel. The waste to product ratio can be over 1000 to 1. For long PEGs, they are made by random polymerization, and there is no technology to make them monodisperse. Therefore, impure PEGs are often used for drug PEGylation. To overcome the challenges in monodisperse PEG production, novel technologies based on solid phase stepwise synthesis will be developed.",,,"The goal of the I-Corps project is to train a graduate student and the principal investigator in the area of entrepreneurship, and to explore the financial viability of a business specializing on production and marketing polyethylene glycols (PEGs) and their derivatives.

During the I-Corps program, the team consisting the Entrepreneur Lead (EL) &ndash; graduate student Mr. Shahien (Shawn) Shahsavari, Industrial Mentor (IM) &ndash; Mr. John Diebel, and Principle Investigator (PI) &ndash; faculty member Dr. Shiyue Fang participated in the intensive kickoff and closing workshops in Houston. The EL and PI for the first time learned the fundamental knowledge of technology commercialization. The team interviewed 104 potential customers, partners and investors. After the I-Corps program, customer discovery continued. In one instance, the team with an additional IM &ndash; Mr. Steve Tokarz partnered with a team of four students (Feiran Li, Mingxiao Zhang, Kimberly Frauhammer, Zhonghao Zhao) from the Project Management &amp; Consulting Class of University of Michigan to explore additional market segments for the PEG synthesis technology. 

We found that our originally hypothesized market segment of PEGs for organic synthesis in academic laboratories alone is not sufficient for a profitable and sustainable business. We discovered that the new market segments of PEGs for stabilizing nanoparticles for drug delivery and for disease diagnosis are more suitable to serve as our initial target markets. If our PEG synthesis technology could be advanced to the level of long PEG synthesis, the market segment of drug PEGylation of protein, peptide and nucleic acid-based medicines would provide larger market and higher profit margin. We also found that the market segments of cosmetic and beauty industries are challenging for our PEG synthesis technology to enter.

With the findings in the I-Corps award period, we prepared an NSF proposal with the aim to optimize the reaction conditions and to scale up the technology, and submitted to the Partnership for Innovation (PFI) Program in January 2019. The proposal was funded in July 2019. Once satisfactory results are obtained, we will timely apply for funding from the NSF SBIR program. We anticipate that at or before the end of the SBIR Phase II award, our PEG commercialization business will achieve financial even, which will pave the foundation for a profitable and sustainable business.

In May 2019, the EL graduated with a PhD in chemistry. His dissertation is in the area of chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides (i.e. short DNAs). Upon graduation, he was employed by the startup company &ndash; Molecular Assemblies, Inc., where he became a member of a team including outstanding nucleic acid chemists and experienced entrepreneurs to commercialize technologies suitable for long oligonucleotide synthesis. The PI, two other graduate students and our Industrial Mentors are continuing to work on our mission to commercialize the PEG synthesis technology.

The technology may also enable long-term sustainability of the nation's energy resources. The proposed technology applies recent advances in photoelectrochemical cells and high-capacity photochromic materials to solar cells that could potentially enable all-day solar power.  The proposed customer-discovery efforts will lead to expanded technical capacity of the developed technology.  Commercializing this technology is expected to enable both overall energy load management and shorter term bridging power of solar cells, and address the growing need for daily renewable energy supply with the expanding penetration of solar energy into the U.S. If successful, this will also minimize the need to build and operate spinning-reserve power plants, a method employed today to close the gaps between power consumption and generation.

This I-Corps project explores commercial application opportunities for next-generation solar cells with integrated storage capability. Currently, most solar batteries are simply a physical addition of a storage device such as a battery or supercapacitor to a solar cell. Such construction involves complicated cell architectures and control processes, and can be prohibitively expensive. To circumvent the problems with the current state-of-the-art in solar energy storage, this proposed technology centers on a dual-function electrode on a photoelectrochemical cell construction, which simultaneously generates and stores electricity during the day, and discharge at night. Differentiators include: simple construction resulting in lower fabrication and maintenance costs, easy scalability and market penetration since the modular panel design is compatible with the existing PV infrastructure; low maintenance because at night or under low-light conditions the discharge is automatically activated.",,,"To explore commercial application opportunities for next-generation solar cells with integrated storage capability, the team comprising of Fuqiang Liu (PI), John Noto (IM), Rajnish Kaushik (Co-IM), Zi Wei (EL) and Husain Almakrami (Co-EL) has successfully completed the NSF I-Corps Program and continues to make strides towards successful commercialization of the all-day solar cell technology developed at University of Massachusetts Lowell.

This I-Corps project aimed at exploring commercial opportunities, through customer discovery and market assessment activities, for the developed solar cells with integrated storage capability that can potentially deliver electricity even in the dark at half the cost of what is currently available today. During the I-Corps program, the team has completed 100 customer interviews with individuals from different archetypes and market segments in solar cells and energy storage. These interviews helped the team to better understand who the targeted customers were for this specific technology and how to develop a business model around their perceived needs. Besides, insights from these interviews offer important perspectives on the developed all-day solar cells and helped the team to pivot from fixed systems including utility-scale/commercial and off-grid applications to portable systems. The team discovered that for applications where weight &amp; volume are critical, there are niche markets for the proposed solar cells with integrated storage capacity. The developed technology, while being able to perform as conventional solar cells with the additional function of energy storage without the need of external batteries, was identified as very attractive to some customers. Based on these, the team has preliminarily identified RV owners, backcountry backpackers, and long voyage sailing boat owners, etc. as the customer segments. The feedback from these customer segments in portable systems has been very encouraging and this developed technology should be able to address their need.

At the conclusion of the I-Corps program, the team has been successful in establishing and updating an initial business model canvas which is constantly being revised. Currently, the team is working through its initial phase of benchmark testing and developing additional functions for the developed all-day solar cells.

This NSF I-Corps program has created opportunities to establish networks with local and nation-wide clean energy industries as potential industry partners in developing the developed technology. This project also created greater value to the participating post-doc and student researchers, who hope to support the nation?s transition to a clean-energy future and enhanced their understanding of innovation, technology translation, and entrepreneurship. Besides, the team has recently applied for a NSF PFI-TT grant to further support continued development of the technology based on the outcome of this I-Corps program. Another outcome of this program is that the PI has incorporated the key concepts and methodologies used in this I-Corps program into his academic curriculum.

This center is devised to concentrate and deploy resources and people to launch a transformation in ubiquitous diagnostics by creating the tools, methods, and technologies for integrated microfluidics that will enable low&#8208;cost, simple, rapid assessment anywhere and everywhere &ndash; agriculture, the environment, food and water supplies, and ultimately for human health and safety.

 

The outcomes from this NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) are multifaceted. First and foremost, CADMIM brings together a multi&#8208;disciplinary team of researchers and institutions. This center incorporates a novel emphasis on design-oriented research that anticipates the need for cost-effective manufacture and practical deployment and a simultaneous, broad-front integrated strategy that seeks breakthroughs at the interfaces of engineering, material science and processing, biology, chemistry, medicine, device design, electronics, and component integration. Productive, long-term collaborative partnerships between universities and industry have been forged over the 5-year award. The composition of the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) includes both large and small firms spanning a variety of business spaces (healthcare, consumer products, agricultural biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, materials, scalable manufacturing, and software).

 

These multidisciplinary teams of IAB members and academics have defined and executed cutting-edge lab-on-a-chip research projects, resulting in new microfluidic platforms capable of integrated high fidelity particle separation (cells, beads, molecules in both continuous streams and droplets), tissue dissociation, sensing analytes in biofluid (blood, sweat, and urine from humans and xylem from plants), sample purification, and combinatorial chemistry. The functions demonstrated in these platforms either meet or exceed the performance of comparable systems in a portable, potentially manufacturable format that will ultimately reduce the cost/test. Results are disseminated through publications, invention disclosures, and patent applications. During the first 5 years, CADMIM published 33 journal papers and 13 conference papers. CADMIM also produced 14 invention disclosures from center-funded research projects. Of these, 9 were converted to provisional patents and 6 ultimately became non-provisional patent applications.

 

CADMIM also provides a unique blend of academic-industrial training for the next generation of researchers and educators. Quite often postdocs mentor graduate students, who in turn mentor undergraduate students in the labs. Also, with the emphasis on manufacturability of the labs-on-a-chip being developed at the center, all students and post-docs are exposed to issues of scalability and market drivers (cost, throughput, performance, world-to-chip interfaces, etc.). Both UC Irvine and U. Illinois Chicago have competitive recruitment mechanisms and attractive cross-disciplinary graduate research opportunities to engage excellent students, including members of underrepresented groups (both sites are federally designated Minority Serving Institutions). All students and post-docs participate in semi-annual CADMIM IAB meetings, where valuable in-person interaction with the IAB members takes place.

 

During the 5-year award, the center involved 14 post-docs, 40 PhD students, 9 master?s students, and numerous undergraduate students in center-funded research. 6 undergraduates were officially supported via Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) supplements, and 3 PhD graduate students received NSF INTERN supplements to do internships with an IAB member. Several other graduate students at both sites also had internships in industry, facilitated by CADMIM and paid by the company, prior to graduation. Having an industrial component to their training helps students and post-docs understand the industrial perspective, provides invaluable contacts in the commercial sector, and eases the transition from university to company after graduation. Over 90% of CADMIM graduate students and post-docs took jobs in industry (either at an established firm or at a start-up company). Those in academia accepted post-doc or faculty positions.

 

Finally, CADMIM makes a conscious effort to translate center research projects into the commercial sector. Faculty have taken advantage of the NSF Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) funding opportunities where teams of faculty and IAB members have successfully received funds to move CADMIM research closer to commercialization. IAB members also initiate sponsored research projects with center faculty as a follow up to CADMIM research projects. Finally, center faculty and students have launched new companies to commercialize CADMIM co-funded research. Since CADMIM?s inception, teams have successfully captured SBIR funds as well as funds from private investors. Proactive emphasis on volume production and on-chip interfaces to existing communications infrastructure are new research priorities for the microfluidics field. Yet these considerations early in the research and design cycle are key to transitioning technologies out of academic laboratories and into the manufacturing sector for the benefit of the general population. The center is continuing along this trajectory in Phase 2.

The conference includes papers on many technologies that are fundamental to the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program and the smart systems aspect of the Partnership For Innovation: Broadening Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) program, including smart and connected communities, pervasive computing, and social computing. This project will fund 20 students to attend the conference, and a selection committee and process will be used to choose from potential invitees. 

The conference will organize a PhD Forum for students and will provide important networking opportunities for the students. The attendance and participation in conference activities including the PhD Forum and student sessions will have strong impact on the education of the next generation of pervasive computing and cyber-physical system experts.",,,"The IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SmartComp) is a good quality conference in the emerging area of smart computing dealing with smart and connected communities. The NSF funds helped support ten US students to attend IEEE SmartComp 2017 conference held in Hong Kong, China on May 29-31, 2017 (www.smart-comp.org) and three students to attend IEEE SmartComp 2018 held in Sicily, Italy on June 18-20, 2018. Five of these students were women and three under-represented minority. They consisted of a mix of undergraduate, MS and PhD students from small schools to big name schools.
 
Intellectual Merit: Smart computing is an emerging multidisciplinary area that can be broadly classified into two major topics: how to design and build smart computing systems, and how to use computing technology for resource sustainability to improve the human experience. Applications of smart computing span a wide variety of business areas including, but not limited to, smart cities, transportation, energy, healthcare, security, banking, disaster management, and social media. The advancement of cloud computing, mobile/pervasive computing, cyber-physical systems, wireless sensor networking and social computing are bringing smart computing to a newer dimension and improving mankind's quality living. Papers presented at IEEE SmartComp 201 and 2018 as well as associated workshops were of high quality. In addition to technical papers, the conference program included high quality keynote talks, exciting panel discussions, Ph.D. forum and demo sessions. Extended versions of selected papers from this conference were invited for publication in Elsevier's Pervasive and Mobile Computing (PMC) journal with high impact factor. The conference technical program discussed new directions of research in Smart Computing and Communities including smart cities, smart cyber-physical systems, smart healthcare, smart grid, smart transportation, internet of things (IoT), security, energy and sustainability.
 
Broader Impacts. Without NSF travel support, many of the US-based students would not otherwise have attended this excellent conference in the emerging field of smart computing. The funds supported 13 students including four women and two under-represented minority students, as well as a mix of undergraduate, master's and Ph.D. students. The students also got an opportunity to network with peers, and additionally were motivated to pursue high quality research and academic careers upon graduation.

Astaxanthin is an especially economically important pigment used in the aquaculture, nutraceutical, and cosmetic industries. Astaxanthin can be made synthetically but there is increasing demand for naturally sourced astaxanthin. Currently, the market value of natural astaxanthin for aquaculture feed is approximately $2000/kg and the nutraceutical market value for natural astaxanthin is alomst $15,000/kg. Recent estimates of the global astaxanthin market size are at more than 250 tons in 2014 and a projected compound annual growth rate of over 7% from 2016 to 2023. This technology provides two main benefits to customers: a natural source of astaxanthin at a potentially lower cost than current sources and potential for future engineering to further increase astaxanthin production and reduce production costs.

This I-Corps project will explore the market potential of genetically engineered lineages of the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus that produced up to 80% more natural astaxanthin than wild copepods. Copepods are tiny crustaceans related to shrimp and are natural component of marine fish diets. This technology is an improvement over the current sources because copepods potentially produce more red pigment at a lower production cost, and it has been demonstrated that genetic engineering for increased astaxanthin production is feasible. This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the market opportunities for the technology through customer discovery interviews that will result in customer feedback that provides a better understanding of the requirements for commercialization. Additionally, this project has the potential to lead to significant progress in research on natural pigment production for commercial applications.",,,"This NSF I-Corps project focused on determining the commercial readiness of an alternative natural source for red pigments used in the production of aquaculture feed for fishes such as salmon, trout, and ornamental tropical fish. Through the I-Corps program we gained training in the lean business start-up methodology that focuses on assessing product-market fit through in-person customer discover interviews. We conducted 106 interviews with potential customers in the farm raised salmon and ornamental fish industries and found that there was a need for an alternative naturally sourced red pigment, but the biggest problem in adopting a new source was supply. We learned that there was a need for our technology, but in order to move forward with commercialization, we would need to work on the scale of production. To this end, we plan to submit a PFI-AIR proposal to work on large-scale production of our product.

This I-Corps project allowed us to evaluate the market opportunities for our technology through customer discovery interviews and resulted in customer feedback that improved our understanding of the requirements for a pathway towards commercialization.The most valuable outcome of participating in the I-Corps program was  the training that PI Hill and Co-PI Weaver received in how to turn  scientific discoveries into potentially viable commercial products that  will attract funding from external sourced and will ultimately benefit  society through economic stimulus of creating jobs.

The workshop will bring together industry and academic researchers from around the country and the world. Industrial and academic participants who are considered thought leaders from a variety of academic fields and areas of application will discuss a long-term human-technology research agenda that will enable the smart service systems of the future. 

Service systems contribute to more than 75% of the U.S. GDP and provide close to 80% of employment. It has been demonstrated that the integration of technology as an aid to the human worker can result in dramatic improvements in productivity by augmenting human capabilities in the workplace. Hence, in the next few decades technology-based innovations in service systems can have enormous economic importance for the United States. Smart service systems also have the potential to become the conduit for social innovations addressing major societal problems. 

The agenda of the workshop can have transformative impact on the US economy and beyond by identifying the grand challenges that industry faces, not for today's service systems, but for the service systems envisioned in 20-30 years. The ultimate objective is to bring attention of academic research on technologies that neither industry nor academia are working on at the moment but that are necessary to enable this next generation of service systems.  

These futuristic services are likely to be enabled by the automation of the built environment capable of providing innovative services by teaming with humans for the benefit of individuals and society. Examples are those enabled by ambient intelligence, cognitive environments, virtual assistants, service robots, intelligent vehicles, smart infrastructure, and autonomous systems or intelligent devices of all sorts, all networked by the internet of things and other communication paradigms. The departments from where academic researchers will be drawn to work on these challenges will be diverse. Participants have been selected based on a broad range of expertise across a variety of research fields, including engineering, information technology, computer science, operations, optimization, and social and behavioral sciences. In particular, researchers who are already interested in trans-disciplinary collaborations will be invited. Industry researchers from Fortune 500 companies in the smart services space will be summoned. With more than a 1000 members with diverse backgrounds representing industry, academia, and government, ISSIP is uniquely positioned to convene this distinct group. 

The collaborating institutions organizing the workshop are the International Society of Service Innovation Professionals, San Jose State University (San Jose, CA) and IBM Research, IBM (San Jose, CA)",,,"The outcome was a set of recommendations for Industry-Academe research partnerships to enable the human-technology frontier for next-generation smarter service systems: 

?    On people-technology symbiosis,  catalyze fundamental research in ""wisdom computing,"" i.e. research technologies that help people become wiser (Wisdom Computing) and to go beyond smart service systems (efficiency) toward wise service systems (sustainable innovation).  Study emergent phenomena in a network of robots and network of robots and humans. Study a network of robots with humans at the periphery, or part of the network - swarm intelligence -  with command and control, and emergent peer-peer scenarios.  Study scenarios of conflict.  How can wisdom be transferred to machines? How can machines develop their own wisdom? How can machines be controlled by human wisdom?  Research to study human identity when technology is augmenting human capability.

?    On People-Technology symbiosis to restore/augment/enhance physical human capabilities, foster human-centric research and education in cross-cutting disciplines such  as systems engineering and systems-of-systems research, data sciences, material sciences, human factors, etc. around themes such as mobility, personal transportation, human factors, aspects of health that are influenced by behavioral and human factors, human-compatible prosthetics/robotics, and bi-directional brain-computer interfaces,   encourage emergent,  experimental approaches to building ecosystems of innovation.

?      On People-Technology symbiosis to augment/enhance cognitive human capabilities, drive Citizen Science projects that result in generation and collection of relevant data. Consider university funding to build  ""charter city"" testbeds, requiring academia-industry collaboration with a long-term research horizon (10-15 years).

?      On Healthcare and Technology, develop a program to study and invite stakeholders to address the grand challenges for prevention of chronic diseases using crowdsourcing to scale. NSF Mechanics that might help include Seed grants, Center grants, Graduate research fellowships, Foundation/NSF partnerships, and Industry/NSF partnerships.

?      On Future Workforce Challenges, support the development of pilot ecosystems &ndash; with platforms for organizing work, workers, learners. Sponsor research to explore new paradigms of work and labor and training &ndash; focused on digital futures.  Support research in the wild &ndash; promote inclusivity, understand needs. Sponsor development of data-driven simulations of future workforce and training scenarios. Create centers of excellence (similar to NSF Science of Learning Centers) to promote interdisciplinary development of workforce, oriented to Ph.D. studies, with industry involvement: Sponsor Ph.D. studies in workforce futures. Support industry involvement in academe for scenario &amp; vision development. Build bridges, such as GOALI program. Support creation of journal that publishes interdisciplinary studies of workforce.

?      On working with Industry Challenges,  social-cyber-physical infrastructure and platform technologies can be used to expand social capabilities, and enhance university-industry collaborations, concerns, capabilities, possibilities, hindrances for alignment, and successes factors need to be studied as an interconnected service system - NSF could facilitate such a study/workshop with a goal to build innovation capacity and create jobs  (i.e. Innovation Matching Market study with impact to jobs, community, and society). NSF could also potentially facilitate a study to understand the flow of university IP revenue, ROI, and opportunity cost ( A similar study on the patent system was done by the National Academies, 2004 - www.nap.edu/catalog/10976/a-patent-system-for-the-21st-century). NSF could catalyze faculty level and graduate level C0-Ops to scale innovation and jobs through entrepreneurship. NSF could catalyze university incubation focused on industry-challenges. NSF could potentially fund the development of a people-cyber infrastructure to support industry-university collaboration, and startups, angels, and VC ecosystems.

?      On Advanced Manufacturing/Maker Collaboration (e.g., manufacturing on demand, etc.), Sharing Economy/Excess Capacity Utilization, NSF could drive a program that encourages industry engagement, where industry could provide a means for scaling and wide deployment.  Look for opportunities where this effort could be integrated into ongoing projects such as I-Core. Consider an ECR that brings the various aspect of this public-private partnership together, researches the long-term implications decentralized manufacturing, and focuses on the workforce development.

?      On IoT services, NSF could act as an accelerator to: 1)Drive industry-university translational research toward the proliferation of use cases and scalability, and especially security and trust. 2) Foster programs for development of innovative individual IoT elements, Integration of elements, and smart services. NSF might design such programs as multi-stage grant program tied to certain milestones. Also, it could design a set of enhanced programs across directorates to encourage interdisciplinarity.

The following table summarizes technology areas with the most promise for the future industry-university collaborations, based on the recommendations of the attendees:

Our lives are shaped by complex, interconnected systems that generate increasingly vast amounts of data -a proliferation that is redefining various domains of engineering. IDSS is at the forefront of this development and this workshop will showcase the recent advances in studying such systems and pave the way for the future. This award will support and fund the sessions focused on smart services, smart cities, smart grid, and graduate education. Bringing together researchers from all five MIT schools as well as distinguished speakers from across the nation, including engineers in various disciplines, together with statisticians and social and behavioral scientists, the workshop will show how rigorous analytical methods can be used to better model, understand, and improve society's most complex systems. The research presented in the workshop takes a holistic, data-driven approach to solving critical societal problems across a range of application domains. Within the broad scope of this research, this NSF-funded workshop will help showcase research across several key areas: smart services and operations in energy systems (the smart grid), urbanization and smart cities, and generally smart services. The research highlighted in the workshop paves the way for new interdisciplinary research in all of these areas. 

The workshop will showcase the state of the art of research in these domains through a series of panel discussions led by top thinkers in their fields. These discussions will foster dialogue about new directions for research and create opportunities for collaboration, while strengthening IDSS?s multidisciplinary research community. The 2-day workshop will be open to the public with free registration and will involve researchers from government, industry, and academia, as well as graduate students in the relevant areas. The Launch Event will also feature a student session that explores IDSS's new programs in Social and Engineering Systems and also in Statistics, and what impact these new programs might have on the future of interdisciplinary, data-driven research for solving society's biggest challenges. There will also be a student Q&A session in which the students get to ask questions and exchange ideas with the distinguished panelists.

As part of its research efforts, IDSS is not only advancing new technologies and new smart services in energy, health, transportation and urban science,, but it is also looking at the powerful implications of these innovations for individuals, larger systems, and society as a whole. There will be a report issued that will present the major findings of the event.",,,"This award supported a 2-day workshop on the occasion of inauguration of the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society at MIT on  September 22 and 23, 2016.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it enables new design options for composites -- impacting a wide range of industries.  This team's technology is an automated method of forming composites that seeks to improve capabilities in the area of composite manufacturing.  The technology allows designers to create new structures that are not currently synthesized or manufactured. Aircraft and automobile industries are typical sectors where composites are used to reduce weight. Through this project's technology, composite designers will be able to realize greater weight savings than they have using traditionally  designed and manufactured composites.  These weight savings will allow designers to meet fuel efficiency standards, increase payload capacity, and extend the range of vehicles or airplanes.

Composites formed using traditional automated processes are constrained to 2D laminate structures using unidirectional tapes (narrow, woven fabric materials).  Composites formed this way are vulnerable to impact damage and severely limit the options available to the designer.  This project's technology permits the local manipulation of fabric geometry in a composite, which allows designers to optimize the strength and stiffness of the composite structure.  Additionally, this technology allows interlacing of adjacent layers in the composite, which enhances the impact resistance of the composite.  Participation in I-Corps will allow the proposed technology to be evaluated for commercial merit and enable the development of a commercialization strategy.",,,"During the Summer 2016 NSF I-Corps Program (NYCRIN Node), our team (WEAV3D) conducted 100 customer discovery interviews. Georgia Tech has developed a composite manufacturing machine that combines weaving and composite consolidation into a single process, to increase production rates and reduce manufacturing costs. Coming into the program, we were initially targeting engineers the aerospace industry as our target customer.  Within our first 20 interviews, the team discovered that the entry barriers in the aerospace market would prevent us from pursuing aerospace as our initial customer. We pursued a handful of alternative markets including: maritime, construction, and racing, before we pivoted to the automotive market. Automotive manufacturers are required to meet the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards, which demands year-over-year improvements to vehicle fuel economy, and vehicle lightweighting is key to achieving this goal. As a result of over 50 interviews within the automotive space, we have discovered that automotive manufacturers will use our manufacturing technology to reduce vehicle weight in order to avoid federal fines from failing to meet fuel economy regulations. This shift from aerospace to automotive assisted us in selecting between two alternative machine designs to pick the machine that had the highest commercial potential.

Based on our positive I-Corps experience, the WEAV3D team is currently working to commercialize the composite forming technology and both entrepreneurial leads, Chris Oberste and Lewis Motion, have expressed an interest in starting a company to bring the technology to market. Chris is planning to graduate with a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering in the Summer of 2017 and Lewis is expected to graduate with his MBA in the Spring of 2017. After completing the 6-week I-Corps program, Chris returned to Detroit to conduct additional automotive interviews, while Lewis attended a snow sports trade show to discover alternative markets. As part of their commercialization efforts, Chris and Lewis are participating in several business plan competitions during the Spring 2017 semester, and have already taken second place ($1,250) at the Georgia Bowl Business Plan Competition. The PI, Ben Wang, has received $50,000 from the Georgia Research Alliance to assist with the construction of a prototype of the composite forming machine. Additionally, the team has applied for the NSF PFI:AIR-TT grant ($200,000), which would further assist the team in bringing the technology to commercially ready state.

The results of this effort will transform the current way of conducting drug testing and regenerative medicine studies through providing time- and cost-effective solutions to overcome the shortcomings of two-dimensional monolayer cell culture and animal models. The technology incorporates multidimensionality along with the native mechanical environment to the cell culture platform. This will reduce the time and resources spent on animal breeding and husbandry associated with using animal models without compromising the complexity of 3D environment. The technology will increase consistency, reliability, repeatability of drug toxicity assessments, which will also save time and money for researchers, scientists, and pharmaceutical companies. Further, the technology can accommodate various types of cell-encapsulated structures; thus it provides great flexibility to study different tissues in which mechanical stimuli predominantly influence the cellular functions and disease states.

This I-Corps project further develops a controlled three-dimensional in vitro culture environment for cells while culturing them in physiologically relevant mechanical environment. The technology utilizes a loading chamber that provides an innovative method of handling and transfer of mechanical strains to tissue engineering scaffolds. The prior research lays the foundation of the technology's potential utilization in pharmaceutical and regenerative medicine related industries. The in vitro study results demonstrated that the technology preserves cell viability during mechanical loading and affects the lineage commitment of stem cells based on applied mechanical strain and frequency. These results are crucial to prove the concept of its utilization towards pharmaceutical and regenerative medicine applications. In the I-Corps program, the business hypothesis will be tested and redefined following customer discovery interviews. The market need for the technology will be also identified.",,,"Our technology is a three-dimensional cell culture system to create skin substitute under various physiologically relevant mechanical stretch conditions for pre-clinical formulation testing. Through funding provided by NSF, we identified that our technology can address the current limitations of cosmetic industry in cosmetic product testing. We have conducted 103 interviews with potential decision makers, recommenders, economic buyers, and end-users. Based on these interviews, we have identified our business hypothesis, value propositions (VPs), customer archetype, and commercialization strategies including what kind of channels are suitable to promote our technology, what Life Time Value (LTV) and Customer Accusation Cost (CAC) are for our technology. The interaction with individuals in our technology?s ecosystem further confirmed that our technology could be a painkiller for the cosmetic industry rather than a supplement. The LTV for our technology is 129K/year/customer while CAC is around 31K/year/customer. This will provide us a good profit margin to break even in three years after launching the product based on our technology.  Thus, we decided to create the technology through funding from federal and state funding agencies including NSF PFI-AIR program and Ohio Third Frontier Programs. We will submit proposals to these programs and will secure funding for creating minimum valuable product (MVP) for our technology. We will also submit a proposal to SBIR to move the technology further to the commercial settings.

Bringing a novel fault detection and traceback system to market may have significant impact on the software-defined network management business.

This I-Corps project aims to develop a commercialization plan for a network management and troubleshooting tool for software-defined networks. The technology aims to provide network operators with improved network visibility. Software-defined networks are very dynamic, which provides network operators with the capability and flexibility to program the network, but at the cost of more complex troubleshooting. The methodology used in our technology uses network state in such a way that enables operators to visualize the evolution of their network, resulting in faster root cause analysis when network faults occur.",,,"This I-Corps project aimed to explore the market needs for a simulation tool for network operators that helps them reduce the risk of major network malfunctions by at least 10% by evaluating planned network changes and their potential effects a priori. The team conducted over 100 customer interviews and refined the business model along the lessons learned during the I-Corps course.

The intellectual merit of this work was the goal to help implement networks that are less likely to fail or can recover more quickly from failure, thus providing a more reliable networking infrastructure. The project targeted software-defined networks, which promise improved network functionality, but have seen slower-than-expected deployment due to the lack of network management solutions. Bringing a novel fault detection and traceback system to market was seen as having the potential for significant impact on the software-defined network management business. 

We developed a commercialization plan for our network management and troubleshooting tool for software-defined networks. The main pivot points for our project were the observations that many organizations only use software-defined networking experimentally and not (yet) in production. We also learned that managing legacy devices is a more critical concern for operators than emerging technologies. Finally, we identified an opportunity for network management tools that combine information from many different systems and technologies.

The broader impact of this work aimed at technology transfer and workforce development. The outcome of our project was a proposal to the NSF PFI:AIR-TT program with the goal to further develop the underlying technology to address the market needs which we had discovered. Also, all team members learned how to apply a customer-centric perspective in entrepreneurship.

The project can potentially enhance the quality of life by eliminating concerns of frequent charging of low-power electronic devices. By wireless charging of small form factor sensors, the expenses and environmental concerns associated with battery-replacements can also be mitigated. This project will result in an extensive customer discover process, through which high-impact sectors will be shortlisted from the sectors of healthcare, wearables, automative industry, and smart homes/offices. It will spur innovations across the wide spectrum of applications scenarios in context of the emerging Internet of Things paradigm by addressing the critical energy needs of the network

This I-Corps project defines a new network architecture that is capable of distributed wireless RF-based charging by combining both hardware and software platforms. The proposed technique of collaborative beamforming allows an exponential increase in wireless charging rates due to constructive interference and real-time adaptation of energy signals using minimal receiver feedback. This project leverages a software-defined distributed energy beamforming plane to ensure continuous feedback used for selecting various parameters at the energy transmitters that give high charging rates. Finally, it assesses energy needs over the network and is able to schedule energy broadcasts proactively. While omni-directional and MIMO-based beamforming from a single charger have been investigated recently, this I-Corps project attempts to explore innovative applications of distributed and concurrent energy transfers from multiple spatially-located energy transmitters (ETs).",,,"We created a wireless charging solution that continuously and automatically powers small form factor ensors. This I-Corps project was concerned with finding the right product-market fit for our wireless charging system through in-field customer discovery and evidence-based verification of a profitable business model. The team members were Kaushik Chowdhury (PI), Yousof Naderi (EL) and Mike Cavaretta (Mentor).

Through the ICORPS customer discovery, we completed more than 110 interviews from more than 13 US states, identified our initial product-market fit as a portable self-charging battery targeting the hospitality sector, and validated hypothesis for our business model, including customer archetypes, value propositions, customer relationships, distributions, revenue models, costs, main activities, resources, and partners.

We chose the hospitality segment for our near term commercialization strategy based on interviews with multiple customer segments, feedback from the instructor team and the collective cohort discussions. We dentified the strategy for getting new customers through public relationships, tradeshows, free hardware, and social media. Finally to grow customers, we determined features that will be incorporated in the future like referral benefits, premium charging service, wireless charging service coverage expansion where customers can use their same account in multiple hotels, student/family plan, and tiered customer support.

We have conducted interviews with several key partners such as portable battery companies and established relationships with semiconductor companies. We identified R&amp;D goals for prototype and controller software as the main key activity, and then later platform management, production, and expansion of reach and distribution as other key activities. 

The project itself involved two phases of on-site workshop visits and weekly updates via teleconferencing to the teaching faculty. Using the collective feedback and experience, we decided to work on filling the technological gaps needed to create the minimum value product (MVP) that would appeal to our target customer segments. We have applied for the follow up programs from NSF (PFI- AIR) and also are ramping up our patent application process. 

Customers reiterated the need for continuously powered mobile devices and IoT through wireless charging. We will use our MVP of the portable battery and the immediate customer segment of the hospitality sector companies as the starting point. This will allow us to mature this technology towards direct charging of mobile phones. We anticipate a future where our technology will be embedded in the back plate of major consumer electronics companies, transforming the way we charge and use wearables, smartphones, and IoT sensors embedded in the environment.

The goal is to fundamentally improve the process by which medical professionals, known as prosthetists, fit their patients after they undergo an amputation. Thus, the proposed work is a novel assessment tool that has the potential to assist the service providers in the prosthetic industry in increasing profits by providing a more reliable, comfortable, and high-quality end product. This will be achieved by providing a device that quantifies the comfort at the interface between the residual and artificial limb, known as the socket, and thereby improves socket designs that enable amputees to return to their daily activities and have an improved quality of life. Participation in I-Corps will also develop the entrepreneurial, networking, and presentation skills of all the team members. The team's participation will also improve education for undergraduate students, as the team will incorporate elements of the I-Corps curriculum at their local university.

This I-Corps project proposes to continue developing a sensor system able to provide quantitative socket fit quality information to prosthetists, enabling them to provide a better fitting prosthetic limb. Current comfort and fit assessment techniques are predominantly based on user feedback and the clinician?s experience. These less than precise techniques can often prove ineffective, leading to further user discontent due to a lack of quality fit. The comfort sensor system in development, therefore, is an embedded sensor array able to measure multiple comfort indicators in a clinical setting. These comfort indicators include: pressure distribution, level of humidity, temperature, and prosthetic alignment. The intended application of the proposed device is a liner fitted, much like socks or liners used by most amputees, between the artificial limb and the residual limb as an interface quality indicator. Its use also has applications for bedsore prevention and fitting of upper and lower-limb amputees. Completion of this I-Corps project will result in customer feedback that will help drive new directions and future iterations of this comfort sensor system and prosthetic socket design.",,,"During the NSF I-Corps&trade; program, the Aperture Prosthetic Technologies (APT) team developed a Business Model Canvas (BMC) for their Aperture Comfort Sensor. The Aperture Comfort Sensor is a tool that measures comfort indicators, such as pressure and temperature, inside the interface between the residual limb and the artificial limb (known as a socket). The original goal of the device was to assist individuals who have suffered an amputation (amputees) to maintain a good socket fit over time and to enable clinicians of any experience level to better assess and fit prosthetic sockets. The Entrepreneurial Leads (EL) and the Principle Investigator (PI) submitted a provisional patent for the Aperture Comfort Sensor last October 2016 (titled ""Aperture Prosthetic Socket Fit Sensor"") following the disclosure of the invention to the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) in June 2016.

During the I-Corps&trade; program, the team visited 33 prosthetic clinics in 15 cities across the United States to complete customer interviews. The team performed a total of 111 interviews with prosthetists, amputees, and prosthetic technicians. Through conducting these interviews, the team learned that the most important characteristic of a good prosthesis is the comfort of the limb-prosthetic interface. The comfort of the residual limb inside the socket is usually related to even pressure distribution, sufficient airflow inside the socket, a stable temperature, proper alignment, low weight, and snug fit on the residual limb. Discomfort or pain in the residual limb can lead to injuries, future hospitalization, or rejection of the prosthetic altogether. Another important finding of the APT team is that clinicians are in need of a way to see inside the socket. Typically, clinicians are only able to assess socket comfort based on feedback from amputees. However, not all amputees can effectively identify discomfort and communicate this with their prosthetist. Therefore, the continued development of the Aperture Comfort Sensor aims at enabling clinicians and amputees to share a deeper level of understanding of fit inside the socket.

At the beginning of the program, the team hypothesized that prosthetists were the primary customer segment due to the problems they face when trying to achieve the best possible fit for their patients. However, during customer interviews, the team soon realized that the market size, when selling to prosthetists alone, was very small. More importantly, the team learned that amputees also need to be aware of the fit of their prosthesis at all times to maintain a comfortable fit and avoid future injuries. Therefore, the team pivoted to a new customer segment. Now, rather than selling to clinicians, the team?s approach is to provide the Aperture Comfort Sensor to amputees &ndash; a much larger customer segment.

To be able to deliver the Aperture Comfort Sensor to amputees, the team learned that amputees would have to purchase the device from their prosthetist with funds provided by their insurance provider. The APT team redirected their interviews to individuals cognizant about the process followed for paying for prosthetic components by insurance providers. Investigations so far point to needing more research regarding insurance providers to know the process for adding products to their list of approved items. Therefore, due to the limited understanding of insurance providers and the need to develop a Minimum Viable Product, the APT team was a NO GO on starting a company until future research and help establish a clearer path towards commercialization.

Further development of the technology is now the focus of the EL?s graduate dissertation research. To this end, the EL and PI are pursuing funding to continue the development of the device. Based on the results of this project, the PI and EL were able to submit a proposal last October 2017 to the NSF PFI: AIR-TT funding program. 

In addition to continuing to develop the technology, the PI and Business Mentor (BM) have also embarked on a mission to share the I-Corps&trade; model of entrepreneurial education at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). In the fall 2016 and spring 2017 semesters, the PI and BM designed and taught a two-course sequence in which third-year undergraduate students are developing a BMC for their products and conducting customer interviews. As a result, the PI received a grant to support this course sequence development.

In the end, this program has profoundly impacted the entrepreneurial education of the ELs, PI, and BM. It has redirected the development of the Aperture Comfort Sensor towards a market that is more realistic. It has influenced the design of innovation and entrepreneurship educational programs at UTEP. The I-Corps&trade; methodology has now become such an integral part of the way the PI does research that no graduate student will leave her lab without conducting a significant number of customer interviews.

The energy density requirements of modern computing devices are higher than ever before, leading to strict power constraints in mobile devices, high operating costs for fixed infrastructure computing, and incredibly low yields for the highest-density microchips. Mobile device manufacturers fiercely compete on battery life. Cloud service providers consume, and pay for, the energy equivalent of small cities. Meanwhile, the competitiveness of American manufacturers hangs in the balance. The present project will have wide ranging impacts in Energy and Power Management in microchips, electronic devices, and smart power demand-response management systems that utilize them, by increasing IC performance without increasing power ? opening the door to a new era of computer power utilization. 

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project expands upon both industry and academic research concerning in-situ power measurement and power management of integrated chips.  For the most part, to date both industry and academic research has produced a striking paucity of practical solutions for in-situ power measurement. This project, however, builds upon prior NSF-funded research which has pointed toward novel practical applications. By removing significant technical risks in an industry-class testbed, this STTR project will demonstrate the viability of one of these applications, which will provide accurate sub-component level power and temperature monitoring, run-time hotspot detection on a fully packaged chip, and intelligent power management based on accurate power/temperature measurements.  Until this is project is complete, no one can predict whether it is possible to operate with overheads that are low enough to justify commercial adoption.",,,"This STTR Phase 1 project is a follow-up technology transfer of an on-chip digital power monitoring technology developed through NSF PFI: AIR-TT RTPMSoft. The Sub-circuit Energy Monitoring and Performance ReActionSoftware (SEMPRA Software) focuses on applying the sub-component level power monitoring technology on commodity System-on-Chip (SoC) for overall performance boost and power consumption optimization.Among several types of SoCs today, graphical processing units (GPUs) is pervasively used in a number of growing fields in computing industry such as Cloud Computer, Big Data, Machine Learning, Smartphones, ComputerGames, Virtual/Augmented/Mixed Reality systems, as well as Computer Animated Movies.Therefore, we shifted our research and development effort toward applying Semprasoft to commodity GPU interface. The Sempra software is not only less expensive but more accurate than the direct power measurement method(s). Furthermore, the power measurement can be done either during verification phase of the manufacturing process or on-line with minimally invasively and inexpensive instrumentation. The extracted chip-specific power data can be used to tune the software that runs on GPU cores to optimize its overall power use and performance.These features provide significant advantages in system cost, measurement accuracy, and monitoring performance
when compared to the leading technology in this market space such as on-chip analog-digital converters (ADCs), inferential digital sensors, and event-based power modeling.The Sempra software has broader applicability to other areas of computing such as low power computing, high-performance server systems, and consumer appliances such as mobile phones. Indeed, all the technology trends suggest a future where a fine-grained energy accounting system will be an integral part of most computing devices.While the experts in the industry have recognized the necessity of using fine-grained power measurement in an integrated circuit (IC) design to make advances in low-power and high-performance systems, the state-of-the-art measurement technologies are insufficient to support the needs of modern chip designs.As this project translates from research discovery toward commercial application, the translated product(s) will fill the technology gap in the power measurement technology to enable advances in on-chip power management in modern ICs without the need for specialized hardware. The project is driven by an innovative power measurement technology to produce purely software-based prototype running on a full-fledged embedded processor platform capable of running most commercial operating systems. This prototype will provide conclusions that generalize beyond the research results. The potential economic impact is expected to increase rapidly in the next five to ten years to affect a significant portion of $300B IC market. More specifically, the work will contribute to the U.S.competitiveness in the future of power-aware IC industry.

Under previous NSF funding the researchers have developed extremely fast approaches based on the fast multipole method to do simulations in acoustics, fluid mechanics and electromagnetics. They have also developed parallel approaches to accelerate their algorithms via the cluster hardware accelerated by graphic processors. The simulation industry is currently a niche industry, with several relatively small companies serving different industries with specific pieces of software. However, it is ripe for disruption and broadening - by taking advantage of advances in infrastructure - cloud and heterogeneous GPU accelerated computing; and the development of software engineering approaches that have shown that many traditional tasks that were done locally on a user's computer in the past, can now be delivered as a service using the network and the cloud infrastructures that are widely available. In the proposed I-Corps project the proposed team will investigate the possibility that such an approach may be commercially viable.

This I-Corps team has already been requested by a number of commercial entities for software simulations services for simulation of electromagnetic and acoustical scattering from complex objects. Through the I-Corps process, this team will be able to place these requests in context, and develop a larger plan for creating a successful company. The team will understand the steps needed to develop a service around high performance computing (HPC) methods and capabilities available via cloud computing, the use of advanced co-processors, such as graphics processors, and advanced scalable algorithms, such as the fast multipole methods. Based on the feed-back received in the I-Corps customer interview process, the team can add a number of capabilities to the codes, such as their efficient mapping into distributed computing systems, where each computing node consists of several CPU cores and one (1) or several GPUs. At the end of the I-Corps project, the team plans to provide a demonstration in which the proposed software is used to provide high performance cloud computing and interfacing for some basic problems in electrostatics and acoustics. The selection of the demonstration application will be guided by the customer discovery efforts undertaken in the I-Corps curriculum. The key outcome of this development will be a demo that can subsequently be applied and built upon to show off our technology to potential customers and investors.",,,"The participants (Nail A. Gumerov, Principal Investigator; Ross Adelman, Entrepreneurial Lead; Ramani Duraiswami, Mentor) took part in a structured program that involved instruction in the lean launchpad methodology, as well as over a hundred customer interviews, to elucidate what customer needs could be met by the National Science Foundation funded algorithms the Principal Investigator,  colleagues and students had developed. We interviewed people from Education, Government, Design, Acoustics, Electromagnetics, Consulting, and Automotive industries. Certain misconceptions about these industries and the way they purchase products were resolved. Various presentations were made to the instruction team based on these reports. A product-market fit that was sustainable was sought.

We also developed a minimum viable product, that lead to some collaborative work with a potential customer. We found out that there was a need for our fast cloud based simulations in several industries, especially if it was offered as a service. However, we also found out that some further translational research needed to be performed, and that there was a market after that research would be performed. Accordingly we decided to puraue a Partnerships for Innovation: Accelerating Innovation Research- Technology Transfer (PFI:AIR-TT) project to address those issues. We anticipate launching a product/service once these issues have been fixed.

Detection of viruses associated with sewage, such as coliphage, requires sending a water sample to an off-site laboratory.  In the lab,  the samples are spread onto petri dishes covered with a smooth lawn of host bacteria.  In about 24 hours, the virus causes visible clear areas called plaques to form in the lawn of bacteria.  The plaques are counted and results are sent back.  The process takes 2-3 days and costs $20-50.  This I-Corps team has designed a test kit for detecting fecal matter viruses in contaminated recreational water.  The team genetically engineered a strain of E. coli bacteria so that when particular types of virus are present, the bacteria produce a red color.  The intensity of the red color that develops is related to the amount of bacteriophage present in the contaminated water.  The test can be run in less than 4 hours, offering a considerable competitive advantage over current virus detection methods.  It will be easy to use and to read,  detecting the coliphage with a simple color change.   This would help officials at the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) and the Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) to test the water at a beach in the morning, and post the same day contamination status or close the beach before people are exposed to contaminated water conditions.  

This project offers a swift and inexpensive way to detect harmful coliphage virus contamination in recreational waters.  This team's  main goals and the scope of this I-Corps team project are to: (1) Develop a prototype kit and compare its performance with gold standard methods.  Lab space will be rented at Innovation Park in South Bend.  Various field representatives at IDEM have offered to provide water samples and share their ""gold standard"" lab results, which will help the team validate the kit's performance on real samples.  (2) Evaluate which market--regulatory, educational, recreational boaters - would be the best starting point for commercialization of the kit.  This team intend to conduct several interviews during the I-Corps program.  Interviews and hands-on demos with prospective purchasers of the kit would be the team's main method to evaluate the usability of the kit and its strongest initial market.",,,"The Coliphage Biosensor iCORPs project grew out of a research project that Kevin Campbell and Lyuda Trokhina did at Ivy Tech Community College in South Bend, Indiana.  104 potential customers were interviewed, and the entrepreneurial leads, scientific advisor, and business advisor learned about the ""lean business canvas"" approach to setting up a business model.   By participating in the iCORPs program, the team honed its product-market fit and learned about the regulatory process that the product would need to satisfy.  Now incorporated as K&amp;L Bioscience, Kevin and Lyuda continue to commercialize their virus test kit, which can quickly determine whether the water at a beach is safe for swimmers.  

Other activities during the grant period included:

Fundraising pitches to Shane Fimbel, Elevate Ventures, Lark Investments, South Bend Parks and Recreation Department, and South Bend Mayer Pete Buttigeig.  The goal of these pitches is transition funding and partnership for field testing of the virus test kits.  South Bend operates a white-water rafting course which would be a good test site.  
Submission of PFI-AIR, SBIR, and IL/IN Sea Grant proposals.  The goal of these proposals is to nail down the technical details--strengths and limitations--of the virus detection method, and to develop prototype kits that can be tested with users.  These studies are necessary for regulatory approval of the virus test kit.  
Outreach activities at 5 local high schools and colleges. Kevin and Lyuda remain engaged with the Ivy Tech biotechnology program, which has grown from class sizes of 3-5 to class sizes of 24, and have initiated collaborations with local high schools.  The team figures that if high school students can use the test kits correctly, lifeguards and park rangers should be able to manage too.

Currently there are over five million Americans, predominantly older adults, suffering from heart failure. These patients are expected to follow complex medication regimen and self-management practices at home to stay healthy and prevent getting admitted to hospitals. A mobile application (HeartMapp) is proposed to act as a health coach by reminding patients to follow health care providers' recommendations at home. Decision making on heart failure symptoms are often confusing and challenging for patients. The HeartMapp offers automated feedback to patients based on the patients' weight, heart rate, and symptoms entered in HeartMapp. Thus, patients are alerted when symptoms are mild to take the next step and prevent worsening and readmissions. Under new regulations, if these patients are readmitted within 30-days after discharge from hospital, the hospitals are not reimbursed, as well as penalized if the readmission rates are higher than a government set limit. Reducing readmission penalty for heart failure will provide financial benefit for health care organizations by generating revenue. Therefore, hospitals are also interested in finding ways to keep patients engaged in their self-management. In order to make HeartMapp available, this project needs to better understand the complex health care ecosystem, i.e., all the players in this market, the customers and the value that HeartMapp provides to them, the users and buyers and the approval process, and the revenue streams and resources needed to make it happen.

HeartMapp is an easy to use non-pharmacological, non-invasive application developed with five main features as intervention options: 1) assessment of daily weight, blood pressure, and chronic heart failure (CHF) symptoms with automated feedback to enhance decision making for management of symptoms; 2) exercise including physical activity (walking) and deep breathing to improve physical health and well-being; 3) real time vital signs monitoring utilizing a wearable Bluetooth device; 4) CHF info that includes audio enabled interactive CHF education to improve knowledge; and 5) Stats, a graphical module that displays trends on patient performance. From the technical standpoint, HeartMapp is currently available in the Android platform but it needs to be updated and enhanced to include the features coming out of this I-Corps project and translated into other software platforms (iOS and Windows) to expand the customer base.  The current vision is to create a startup company or collaborate with an existing company to host the software and market the technology and license it to be included as part of existing solutions. The final report of I-Corps project will serve as a guiding document to: 1) submit a Phase I SBIR proposal in order to update the technology and test the HeartMapp for its efficacy in improving self-management of patients with CHF and thus potentially curb costly readmissions; 2) submit a Phase II SBIR proposal to take the technology to the market place; 3) Create a startup company or join an existing company interested in the commercialization of HeartMapp; and/or 4) find investors to provide the necessary funding to achieve our goals.",,,"The NSF I-Corps award #1633650; ""HeartMapp for patients with Heart Failure"" helped the team (Athilingam, Jenkins, and Zumpano) to explore value proposition, customer segments and potential commercialization. We interviewed 125 potential customers. Our customer discovery process indicated that hospitals and home care agencies are exploring the use of novel technology, because current telemonitoring systems to track patient at home care are bulky, costly to maintain, and gives false hope to patients as being monitored and lack self-confidence in caring for themselves. The proof of concept was completed and results published (Athilingam, Jenkins, Zumpano, &amp; Labrador, 2017). Our team used an iterative process and completed a minimum viable product of the HeartMapp with seven key components to impact self-care of heart failure patients at home. The features of HeartMapp include: 1) assessment, 2) pill management, 3) exercises, 4) vital signs monitoring weight and blood pressure; 5) heart failure education (CHF info), 6) performance tracker (Stats), and 7) communications. The built-in algorithm in HeartMapp serve as a point of care system and provides alerts, automated feedback and cues for action to manage HF symptoms at home, follow provider recommendation on medication, diet and exercises, and thus improve quality of life and reduce costly readmissions. HeartMapp is copyrighted by USF and the two investigator (Drs. Athilingam and Labrador) who have developed HeartMapp. The next step is to submit proposal to NSF for a Partnership for Innovation Technology Transfer (PFI-TT) award to evaluate the feasibility and functional limitation of our innovative mobile health system ""HeartMapp"" and our identified market opportunity for commercialization.

Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC) technology reduces the time and cost to perform complex biological laboratory experiments through miniaturization and automation; applications of this technology include medical diagnostics, point-of-care testing, biomedical research, water quality management, environmental monitoring, etc. The design automation software will simplify the process of LoC design, providing benefits such as reduced cost of design and testing, faster time-to-market, and lower likelihood of human error. Successful commercialization of these research efforts will enhance scientific productivity and lower the barrier-to-entry for new users of LoC technology.

The goals of this project are to train the principal investigator, entrepreneurial lead, and mentor in technological entrepreneuriship, and to enable them to meet with potential customers for their technology. The scope of the project involves attending two training sessions in Washington, D.C., attending weekly webinars, and traveling to visit potential customers, including academic laboratories in the biological sciences, and companies in segments such as biotechnology, medicine, healthcare, etc. The I-Corps team members will leverage these experiences to assess commercial interest in their microfluidic design automation software along with its readiness in terms of meeting customer needs. If commercialization is successful, future users of laboratory-on-a-chip technology will be able to leverage our software to automatically design their chips, as opposed to current practice which is to manually lay out the entire architecture by hand.","McDaniel, Jeffrey and Grover, William H. and Brisk, Philip~The case for semi-automated design of microfluidic very large scale integration (mVLSI) chips~Design Automation and Test in Europe~~2017~~~10.23919/DATE.2017.7927283~10026408~1793 to 1798~10026408~OSTI~06/07/2017 17:02:11.963000000",,"Laboratory-on-a-chip (LoC) devices are used primarily for point of care diagnostics. Compared to traditional benchtop chemistry methods, LoCs offer the benefits of lower cost and reduce sample and reagent consumption. This makes them particularly attractive for use in the developing world and among poverty-stricken communities. With ever-increasing attention being paid toward personalized medicine and low-cost diagnostics, insufficient attention has been paid to the process by which the diagnostics themselves are designed. The lack of usable design tools slows progress and product development, which is of particular concern when dealing with outbreaks and epidemics. The advent of more sophisticated design tools for these LoCs, such as the design tools for which this I-Corps Award explored commercialization opportunities, will have significant and meaningful impact on the healthcare industry. As a result of these efforts, LoCs will become faster and easier to design, and increased accessibility will enlarge the pool of potential product designers. This will increase the use of LoCs in academic research and is projected to increase the number of LoC-based products introduced to the consumer market.
Through the I-Corps training and customer discovery process, we discovered that the burgeoning LoC industry is not ready, and lacks interest, in fully automated design solutions. The customer discovery interviews that we conducted illuminated the shortcomings of existing adhoc solutions to LoC design. These results suggest that the current focus of many research groups in the principle discipline (application of Computer Engineering principles to LoC design) are misguided and do not address the actual pain points experienced by LoC designers, but could address challenges faced in the future as a result of higher levels of microvalve integration.
This led to a pivot, away from algorithmic design automation and toward a graphical design suite that incorporates fluid modeling into the design process. The PI obtained funding from the NSF PFI:AIR-TT program to develop a minimum viable product (MVP), along with additional technology relating to integrate fluid modeling. The I-Corps Entrepreneurial Lead (McDaniel) has incorporated Quick Liquid Layout, Inc. to commercialize the research. The company is in the process of negotiating a licensing agreement with UCR and finalizing the MVP with the intention of bringing the product to market this summer. Once the product achieves commercial viability, it will be poised to revolutionize how microfluidic devices are designed, effectively lowering the barrier for entry for biologists and chemists who are the expected users of these devices. This will enable more researchers and companies to enter the field, thereby increasing the overall size of the market.
In retrospect, it is clear that the disciplines involved in LoC design (material scientists, bioengineers, biologists, and chemists), have not been collaborated to the fullest extent possible, and this has held back both research and commercial development efforts. With the advent of better design tools, these distinct fields will be able to better specialize, yet still be able to communicate with each other and collaborate more effectively. For example, material scientists and bioengineers could focus mostly on material properties for biocompatibility and the development of new microfluidic components, while computer scientists and computer engineers will be able to address the aspects of design automation that differentiate microfluidics from semiconductor technology. Lastly, the biologists and chemists, whom, to date, have not been able to attain LoC devices that meet their needs due to the prohibitive learning curve for device design, will be able to design devices by stitching together components using a simple graphical interface. As the design automation aspect of the field continues to mature, greater levels of automation will be introduced to the design flow, reducing the amount of domain knowledge required to design and use LoCs. Quick Liquid Layoud, Inc. aims to fill that gap, which was elucidated through the NSF I-Corps customer discovery process.

There are many types of bacteria that can be grown in the lab but their potential impact on people's lives has not been realized. New tools are needed to unlock bacteria?s true potential to solve many challenges of interest to mankind. Creating tools to accelerate discovery of new cancer treatments, alternative fuels, or low cost biomaterials will significantly impact human life. Population growth and increasing lifespans are putting ever increasing demands on the environment, driving need for alternative sources of fuels, food, and medicines. Bacteria have been a bit neglected as sources for innovation; however, they already have the internal machinery to help do industrial processes in a fast and efficient manner.

Pulsed electric fields (i.e. electroporation) can be used to deliver genetic material into many types of cells including bacteria. The goal of this proposal is to substantially expand the successful application of pulsed electric fields to bacteria and enable discovery of new applications in genetic engineering and synthetic biology. A major limitation of synthetic biology is the inability to incorporate genetic material into many bacteria due to the challenge of permeating the cell envelope while maintaining high cell viability. This team's goal is to reduce the time required to develop tools to genetically manipulate bacteria from months or even years to days. This I-Corps team has developed a proof-of-concept microfluidic device to enable the characterization of the critical electric field for bacterial electroporation under specific experimental conditions in a single experiment. The team is devising a technique to test several thousand unique conditions within a single day, spanning the entire parametric space. This will be done using a microfluidic platform, or several in parallel, to test small aliquots of cells at varying experimental conditions. Therefore, the proposed microfluidic system enables quantification of the critical electroporation parameters in a single experiment, which would otherwise require months of experimentation. The proposed innovation will allow two significant advancements: 1) the ability to quickly determine high yield electroporation conditions and 2) the ability to utilize many of the more than 10,000 bacterial strains that have been heretofore intractable or difficult to genetically manipulate.","Paulo A.

The team sought to develop and evaluate the market potential of an electroporation assay technology that facilitates the exploration of microorganisms that are currently considered difficult to genetically engineer for a variety of industrial and biomedical applications. In electroporation, a high electric field is used to open pores in cells (including bacteria) that allow foreign nucleic acids to enter the cell for re-programming. However, it is well know that most of the bacteria that can be grown in the laboratory cannot be genetically engineered using traditional electroporation or other methods. We believed that a platform that could rapidly and quantitatively determine optimal conditions for genetic engineering via electroporation would accelerate the development of novel bacteria for applications ranging from treatments for diseases to bacterial strains that can clean oil spills. In conjunction with this effort we interviewed more than one hundred individuals representing more than forty companies seeking to leverage synthetic biology in bacteria for such applications. We found out that even though genetic engineering of new bacteria is of interest, it is not the biggest problem that these organizations face. Alternatively, we learned that there are other problems related to the delivery of nucleic acids to bacteria that are more pressing. As a result we have pivoted our research and development efforts in order to address more urgent limitations for genetic engineering of bacteria.

Over the course of this effort, in addition to our market research, we made several scientific and technological advances that have resulted in three accepted journal articles, two patent applications, and numerous conference presentations. Results of this work directly resulted in additional funding from the National Science Foundation through the Partnerships for Innovation: Accelerating Innovation Research- Technology Translation  (PFI: AIR-TT) initiative. Finally, our efforts have also led to the formation of a company that will seek to commercialize the technology developed as a result of this award.

This equipment will be useful to a variety of industries that are looking to reduce air pollution from their processes, including: automotive, chemical, oil and stationary power. The portability of the equipment means that one can take the diagnostic to the source; there is no need to approximate conditions in the laboratory (which is what is usually done). This device will allow companies, that otherwise do not have the equipment or staff to make these measurements, to evaluate the efficacy of third party technologies with their proprietary or developmental devices. For example, Fiat Chrysler America (FCA) could test a third party automotive catalyst on exhaust from one of their developmental engines, to see if it will meet emissions requirements in-house, rather than sending both the highly proprietary developmental engine and catalyst out to be tested.

This I-Corps team has developed a portable and versatile characterization microreactor for the fundamental, scientific study of both catalytic and non-catalytic heterogeneous reactions. It was designed such that fundamental catalytic activity and selectivity may be examined, providing key knowledge required to develop new materials and processes for catalysts. Additionally, due to the larger diameter sample tube and because the system is capable of measuring performance parameters such as surface area, temperature-dependent activity, and adsorption capacity, it can be used for coal and biomass pyrolysis experiments as well. A portable characterization reactor system could provide these types of functions: assessment of exhaust aftertreatment catalysts in the test cell of an automotive OEM; evaluation of new remediation technologies for the flow of processing stream that contains particulates; variations in waste treatment incineration to find the optimum catalyst for their ever changing fuels; and evaluate new technologies at intermediate steps in full-scale molecular epitaxial processes such as solar cell, circuit board production, etc. A two-pronged approach will be utilized to bring this technology into wide usage.",,,"Through more than 120 customer discovery interviews in the automotive industry including original equiment manufacturers (OEMs), tier one suppliers and service companies, we explored the commercial potential of the unique and portable instrument, capable of studying chemical reactions between solids and gases, that was developed in the Combustion and Reaction Engineering Laboratory at Texas A&amp;M University.

The microreactor was designed specifically such that fundamental catalytic activity and selectivity may be examined, providing key knowledge required to develop new materials and processes for catalysts. This single, portable piece of equipment combines the capabilities of at least three large, expensive, stationary devices. The value of this piece of equipment was vetted by our customer discovery process in the automotive sector, but we predict that it will also be useful to a variety of industries that are looking to reduce air pollution from their processes, including: chemical, oil and stationary power. The portability of the equipment means that we can take the diagnostic to the source; there is no need to approximate conditions in the laboratory (which is what is usually done), when we can evaluate the actual situation.

This device will allow companies, that otherwise do not have the equipment or staff to make these measurements, to evaluate the efficacy of third party technologies with their proprietary or developmental devices, in house, under their control - by working with our proposed service company.This portable, characterization reactor system could provide several functions, including: Assessment of exhaust aftertreatment catalysts in the test cell of an automotive OEM; Evaluation of new remediation technologies for the flow of a gaseous processing stream that contains nanoparticulates; Variations in waste treatment incineration to find the optimum catalyst for their ever changing fuels; Evaluate new technologies at intermediate steps in full-scale molecular epitaxial processes such as solar cell, circuit board production; Evaluation of coal and biomass pyrolysis kinetics; and Standard characterization reactionssuch as chemisorption, BET, kinetic parameter determination, etc.

Based on the learnings we from the ICORPS program, our team realized that we had more work to do on the design to incorporate some ""must have"" features defined by our potential customers, before we could launch a successful company. We are currently pursuing NSF PFI:AIR-TT funding to continue the development of additional novel capabilities. We have identified three milestones to meet before we are ready to start a company: 1. update the technology for the commonly requested ""must have"" features (we are currently working on version 2.0), 2. validate the technology with key partners, such as the US EPA and 3. investigate scalability to other industries through customer discovery in stationary power and commercial incinerators.

In summary, the intellectual merits of the technology will enable researchers to answer key scientific questions related to heterogeneous reactions such as catalysis, pyrolysis, materials characterization and biomass torrefaction. Specific technical advancements include improved kinetic understanding characterization capabilities. The broader impacts to the taxpayers will have clear environmental, societal, and economic benefits. With the dialog so far developed by the I-corps exercise, the scope of possible applications has been significantly expanded to consider fuel cell manufacturers, large stationary power plants, mining, oil refineries, waste processing, large scale film processing industries, federal and state regulatory monitors and the list will most likely expand.

The technologies have the following market-valued features: accurate detection of spoofing attempts in fingerprint, iris and face recognition, and sensor interoperability enhancements for biometric systems.  They will provide significant performance and security benefits when compared to the leading commercial systems currently available in the biometrics market.  The project accomplishes this transfer of research products to the market through the development of robust software, systems and processes.   The outcomes include creation of new high tech jobs in West Virginia?s I-79 technology corridor and in St. Lawrence County, New York, commercial products for the growing biometric authentication market, with the potential to license the products and create a spinoff.  The partnership engaged to transfer the technologies to the market domain include commercial companies affiliated with the Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) at West Virginia University and Clarkson University, including the research and commercialization partner NexID Biometrics, LLC and technology investors, Morpho and Seaway Private Equity Corp.  The potential economic impact is expected to be the range of five to ten million dollars in the next five years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the biometric security market space.   The societal impact will address the national security needs for accurate human identification as well as quickly expanding commercial authentication markets.  The project will develop new pathways for the creation of entrepreneurial workforce through student-led project teams.  The activities will benefit from our strong commitment to bringing research and educational opportunities to students from the underrepresented groups.  The project will serve as a catalyst and a unique model for much needed technology-based economic growth in West Virginia and upstate New York.","Emanuela Marasco, Zach Chapman, Bojan Cukic,~Improving Fingerprint Interoperability by Integrating Wavelet Entropy and Binarized Statistical Image Features~IEEE The 15th International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)~~2016~1~~~0~ ~0~ ~07/09/2017 19:33:10.80000000",,"This project focused on creating an innovation ecosystem and included technology improvement, readiness assessment, market studies and commercialization path development.  The technology readiness assessment phase resulted in the selection of the following technology for further development and prototyping: (1) Fingerprint interoperability middleware, and (2) Liveness detection software, including fingerprint, face, and iris liveness detection. 

Fingerprint sensor interoperability is the ability of a fingerprint-based biometric system to compensate for image variability due different types of sensors. Typical variations observed in fingerprint images acquired by different sensors are image resolution, scanning area and grey level characteristics. Such variations can impact the ability to match effectively.

Liveness detection protects biometric systems from the threat of forgery, commonly termed ""spoofing"". It has been demonstrated that a fake finger, iris, or face can be created easily using common household materials like gelatin. To combat this threat, many countermeasures exist, including liveness detection. Liveness detection approaches measure characteristics of the biometric trait that are indicative of a living biological sample, in this case, through software.

For both projects, commercial versions of the software were created and market feasibility assessments were performed.  Outcomes included publications, patent applications, as well as awarded patents.  Fingerprint liveness detection technology was commercialized as part of the sale of NexID Biometrics, one of the project?s partners, and has been integrated into both commercial and government biometric recognition systems.

Additionally, the development of a network of connections between university researchers, industry developers, business experts, and economic development agencies, led to the creation of an effective innovation ecosystem.

Last, educational programs were created to prepare graduate students who understand innovation and entrepreneurship and take the leadership in the entrepreneurial opportunities created by the center.

Current in-situ monitoring in production plants and laboratories is still mainly based on measuring temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, pressure, airflow, and liquid flow. These parameters do not give information on cell viability, cycle, size, autophagy and apoptosis that are metrics to indicate reproducibility of the bioprocess. FDA suggested key PAT technologies such as near-infrared, mid-infrared, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence and imaging, and mass spectroscopy, are all under active development, but with limitations of one kind or another, such as limited sensitivity, difficult to use, and high cost. Dielectric spectroscopy is also studied as a promising approach, but not yet appropriate for PAT due to limited sensitivity and information contents.

This project involves a novel radio frequency (RF) interferometer technique for On-line Process Analytical Technology (PAT) instrument development. The obtained radio frequency (RF) probes exploit novel interference processes to enhance sensitivity while applying novel tuning mechanisms to cover broad frequency ranges and tune sensitivity for robust system operations. The RF probes are expected to have unprecedented sensitivity and robustness to analyze cell viability, autophagy, apoptosis, and size in a label-free and non-invasive manner.

Guided by the teaching team instructors, the I-Corps team successfully conducted more than 100 interviews of potential customers in analytical labs, clinical diagnostic labs, biopharmaceutical companies, chemical pharmaceutical companies, brewers, distillers and ethanol fuel producers.  Through this process, the I-Corps team gained deep insights about the process of technology commercialization, obtained practical knowledge and significant experience in conducting customer interviews, generated and refined our business model.

We identified brewers, distillers and ethanol fuel producers as our targeted market space, which can be extended to pharmaceutical companies and analytical labs in the future.  The targeted market space involves ~ $400 billion economy output.  The extended market space involves another ~ $800 billion or more economy.  These potential customers need our technologies for real-time online monitoring of biomass, cell viability and contaminations.  So they can have better yield and higher productivity, for which a 1% improvement is significant.  There are currently no effective techniques for customers in these industries to use. 

We also identified the functions of a minimum viable product (MVP), identified the gap between our current technology maturity level and the requirement of an MVP, and developed a plan to build a technology demonstration prototype and a plan to commercialize the technology.  An NSF accelerating Innovation Research- Technology Transfer (PFI: AIR-TT) proposal has been submitted for the development of the targeted prototype.  The original I-Corps team is fully involved in the new PRF: AIR-TT project with strong supporting letters from a few potential customers interviewed during the I-Corps process.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 

I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

With this project, the Alabama Innovation and Mentoring of Entrepreneurs center (AIME) at The University of Alabama expands their existing proof-of-concept center into an I-Corps Site, to accelerate the commercialization of marketable ideas at The University of Alabama. The Site nurtures science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) faculty and students, with projects originating from student work, research, institutional or industrial projects, and creates a local innovation ecosystem that contributes to a larger, national network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. 

The University of Alabama Site provides infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. Working with their regional I-Corps Node at the Georgia Institute of Technology, The University of Alabama Site will improve and expand AIME's current innovation curriculum and training programs. Site funding offers entrepreneurial teams the opportunity to increase their chance of commercial success through funds for the acquisition of modest amounts of equipment or materials needed to fabricate prototypes, travel expenses to consult with potential clients or experts, or other resources needed to directly advance the goals of transitioning a team's project into the marketplace. In addition, the Site offers access to resources and training to the sponsored entrepreneurial teams in order to nurture UA faculty, staff and students to transition their innovative technologies into the marketplace. 

Broader Impacts:
The direct impact is to educate the UA community in technology commercialization, transition teams to becoming NSF I-Corps trained teams and form start-up companies. The potential long term impact is to provide them with the education and skills that will position them to become part of the knowledgeable, creative workforce that will help the US maintain leadership in critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  The University of Alabama Site provides a formal structure to nurture entrepreneurial teams and guide the output of scientific discoveries closer to the development of technologies, products, and processes that benefit society. AIME has consistently recruited underrepresented STEM students and the Site will leverage the university's STEM Path to the MBA program and will encourage and advance minority participation in STEM-based entrepreneurial activities. In addition to impacting the university community, this Site program will enhance networking and partnerships through the involvement of AIME's mentors, who provide a network in their specific industries. Through providing a database of contacts, providing interaction with experts and providing top notch seminars, the University of Alabama Site has the opportunity to increase public participation in STEM activities by providing modest funds for prototypes and exploration into product-market fit, which increases the chance of commercial success. The University of Alabama Site has the opportunity to enhance the value of new ventures and make them better-positioned to hire employees and create transformative products and services for the benefit of society.","o	Mittenthal, Max; Flowers, Brian; Bara, Jason; Whitley, John; Spear, Scott; Roveda, John; Wallace, David; Shannon, Matthew; Holler, Rob; Martens, Rich; Daly, Daniel.~?Ionic Polyimides: Hybrid Polymer Architectures and Composites with Ionic Liquids for Advanced Gas Separation Membranes"",~Ind.

The translated technology has the following unique features: (i) vacuum enclosure of the microcantilever sensors, which will result in highly sensitive detection of nuclear radiation, as well as protection of the sensor from environment and unwanted radiation enhancing sensor reliability; (ii) possibility of using arrays of sensors realized through microfabrication techniques, which can offer imaging capabilities and directionality information; (iii) the usage of bimodal detection technique and two functionalization layers to perform highly efficient and unique detection of neutrons. Thus, it provides exemplary performance, cost savings and efficiency when compared to the leading competing neutron detection technology based on Boron-10 in this market space. The project accomplishes this goal by using a relatively inexpensive material with unique material properties and adopting a design strategy involving the design features mentioned above, resulting in a novel neutron detector prototype. The partnership engages Savannah River National Laboratory to provide guidance in the He-detection market space and other aspects including prototype testing and technology commercialization, as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.

Microcantilevers, which resemble tiny diving boards, can respond to a variety of physical parameters, such as temperature, electronic charge, electrostatic potential, stress, and mass loading, which can be used to develop extremely sensitive sensors. A major challenge with using these sensors to highly sensitive and selective detection of large variety of physical parameters, such as those caused by incident radiation such as neutrons, while maintaining a small form factor of the microcantilever based sensor. In this project, we developed a methodology to solve this problem by: (i) designing and developing a ultra-sensitive piezotransistive microcantilever that can detect surface work function changes down to 10 mV level, which is comparable to state of the art commercial systems, and (ii) by measuring the surface work function changes to perform highly selective detection of analytes as they adsorb on various sensing surfaces. Utilizing this capability, detection of NO2 down to 5 ppm has been demonstrated in this project, and our estimates indicate sub ppm levels of detection is possible. The demonstration of surface work function using these miniaturized cantilevers opens up the possibility of detecting various biological, chemical and radiological analytes using a miniaturized microcantilever based detection system.

The project activities have led to significant contributions to the major discipline of electrical engineering, as well as in the related disciplines of Physics and Materials Science.  They have led to better theoretical and experimental understanding of GaN based microelectromechanical (MEM) devices and systems, utilization of these systems for measurements of surface work function changes, and measurement of surface work function changes to detect trace amount of toxic gases resulting from their adsorption on various sensing surfaces. Overall, the research results obtained in the project have led to 7 journal publications, 3 patent applications, 10 conference presentations, and 1 invited talk.

         The project activities also led to very significant technological and educational broader impacts. In terms of technological broader impact, the development of piezotransistive microcantilever based miniaturized surface potential detection methodology has opened up the possibility to detect a whole range of chemical and biological analytes with potential commercial interests. The project also resulted in the training of one postdoctoral researcher, three doctoral students and two master?s student. The training that the students obtained from this project enabled them to find employment in reputed companies such as Intel, and faculty positions in Lousiana Tech University. The intellectual properties generated from the research has attracted interest from commercial entities for developing marketable sensor systems. The project also led to the creation of research infrastructure at Clemson university (in terms of specialized equipment and test beds), knowledge base, and expertise in the PI?s lab, which is expected to lead to further application of this very promising technology in a large variety of fields.

For example, chemical attack of metal-based anodes and cathodes by the harsh Li-ion battery environment shortens substantially the battery lifetime and strongly reduces it performance. Current metallic prostheses, such as hips and knees, implanted in humans, exhibit corrosion by body fluids, resulting in pain and need for early replacement. This I-CORPS team focuses on identifying and developing the commercialization pathway for novel patented ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) films as coatings for critical components of industrial, electronic, and medical devices/systems exposed to harsh chemically and mechanical environments, improving their lifetime and performance by at least one order of magnitude. The focus of the proposed effort will be to explore the insertion into the market of a new generation of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with UNCD-coated anodes, cathodes, membranes, and inner walls case, to produce LIBs with ?? 10x longer life and smaller dimensions than for current LIBs, due to the protective action of the UNCD coatings on all battery components from corrosion. The technology will be demonstrated for coin-type cell phone small batteries. The other application of UNCD coatings will be for medical devices and implants, for which preliminary work done by this team group has demonstrated that UNCD coatings can enable a new generation of medical implants with order of magnitude longer life and superior performance than current uncoated metal implants (e.g., hips, knees, dental implants, which are failing due to chemical attach by body fluids), which are failing due to chemical attack by body fluids.

The patented UNCD coatings will be grown using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) and hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) techniques, available to the team, to determine which provides the best coating properties for the specific application. The research work over the last 20 years has demonstrated that the UNCD films exhibit unique nanostructures with 3 to 5 nm grain sizes, and a unique combination of properties, namely: 1) highest hardness and resistance to wear (similar to single crystal diamond) compared to any other known coating, 2) extremely smooth surface (rms roughness of ~ 3-5 nm), 3) lowest friction coefficient compared to any other coatings, 4) extremely low stress, 5) tunability of surface wettability from highly hydrophobic (no water adhesion to the surface) to highly hydrophilic (high water adhesion), 6) extremely resistant to chemical attack by any strong acid and human body fluids (critical for applications as coating for medical implants), 7) electrically conductive when doped with boron atoms in the diamond lattice or nitrogen atoms in the grain boundaries, 8) electrically insulating when grown without B or N incorporation, 9) B-doped UNCD exhibits the widest electrochemical potential compared with other electrode materials, 10) UNCD films exhibit one of the lowest threshold voltages for electron emission, 11) UNCD films can be processed by lithography and etching processes used for fabrication of silicon based MEMS/NEMS devices, to produce a new generation of these devices far superior than silicon based counterparts, and 12) UNCD is extremely biocompatible. The UNCD properties mentioned above enable multi-functionalities for a wide range of technological applications as described above, which can make a substantial impact in several high-tech markets. The MPCVD technique will be implanted in an industrial-type system capable of growing UNCD films on up to 200 mm diameter substrates to demonstrate immediate transfer of the UNCD growth process into an industrial compatible process. The HFCVD technique will be implemented in a system capable of growing UNCD films on up to 100 mm diameter substrates.",,,"This I-CORPS program (Title: Technology Transfer for Commercialization of Industrial, Electronic and Medical Device Products Based on a Patented Ultrananocrystalline Diamond Coating) focused on identifying and developing the commercialization pathway for novel patented corrosion resistant ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) coatings for critical components of industrial, electronic, and medical devices/systems exposed to harsh chemically and mechanical environments, improving their lifetime and performance by at least one order of magnitude over current devices. A major focus of the I-CORPS project was to identify the broad commercial impact provided by coating all components (electrodes, membranes and cases) of current Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with the extremely corrosion resistant UNCD films to produce &ge; 10x longer life, safer, smaller LIBs, as demonstrated by initial R&amp;D performed under an NSF-PFI program that was the basis for the application for a I-CORPS grant. The I-CORPS program enabled us to identify customer and partners who can help the development of our start-up to commercialize the new UNCD-based LIB technology for application to mobile communication devices, computers, electronic devices, cars, medical devices (e.g., defibrillators) and many other devices requiring batteries. As part of the ""get-out-of-the-building"" strategy we learned during the I-CORPS program, we were able to talk to battery manufacturers, cell phone companies, and medical device companies. Specifically, we had strong feedback from a major LIB manufacture, a major cell phone manufacturer, and a major defibrillator manufacturer, who expressed strong interest in the UNCD coating technology. As a result of the strong industrial feedback received on the UNCD coating technology for the specific applications described above, Original Biomedical Implants (OBI), registered as an LLC company in Delaware is now developing a pathway for commercialization of LIBs based on the UNCD-coated components. OBI is in the process of signing a non-disclosure (NDA) agreement with the major battery manufacturer mentioned above to start a joint R&amp;D program to develop and commercialize LIBs based on UNCD coated components as described above. Auciello (co-founder of OBI) is discussing with a major manufacturer of defibrillators a possible collaboration to insert the new longer life LIBs with UNCD-coated components in their defibrillators to increase by at least 10x the lifetime of device implantation in patients over current defibrillators with shorter battery lifetime.  In addition, following the pathway showed to us by the I-CORPS program, Auciello was able to connect with a major manufacturer of batteries outside the USA, who invited Auciello to visit the company on May 29, 2015 to make a presentation for the company to learn about the UNCD coating to determine if the technology is appropriate for their product.

Another outcome of our ""get-out-of-the-building"" activity was that we established a connection with a major defense company who indicated that they were interested in coating glasses for some of their products with a corrosion/abrasion resistant coating. We showed to the defense customer preliminary results demonstrating the extreme corrosion/abrasion resistance of the UNCD coatings. Therefore, we got a four months seed funded program from the defense contractor to perform R&amp;D to demonstrate that UNCD can provide the corrosion/abrasion resistant coating on glass needed by the contractor. Initial results indicate that transparent UNCD coatings on glass can provide the solution to the defense contractor need. This activity provided a pivot for our start-up OBI, which now also will have an activity providing R&amp;D service for customers who require a coating with the properties and performance of UNCD for their products.

Current abstractions for software-defined networking assume that traffic traverses the network without being modified en route. In practice, however, many network operators utilize ""middleboxes"" to perform complex traffic processing operations, such as deep packet inspection, load balancing, WAN optimization, and caching. The goal of this project is to achieve a transformational shift in software-defined networks from today's limited ""data transmission"" view to a ""data transmission and processing"" view that more accurately reflects the reality of current and future networks in order to improve control and operational efficiently of the network infrastructure.

The project aims to design and prototype novel mechanisms to describe, implement, and control advanced network services in networks with centralized and hybrid management. Specific objectives are to develop a novel control plane for network services, design novel control plane algorithms, explore dynamics in network traffic that affect the workload on middleboxes, and demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed control plane for network services in a realistic setting based on GENI. The results from this work will provide a novel approach to controlling network services within software-defined networks.

The broader impacts of this project aim at improving network infrastructure, which makes up the Internet and is of critical importance to society. While software-defined networking simplifies and enhances the control that is exerted on networks, it falls short of considering middleboxes and network services, which are an integral part of today's network infrastructure.

This technology is very different from the original internet design. Many network operators utilize ""middleboxes"" to process network traffic for deep packet inspection, load balancing, WAN optimization, caching, etc. These ""network services"" are performed on nodes with stateful processing systems that perform complex operations. Thus, the classical ""routing and packet forwarding"" problem in networking has been transformed into a ""routing, processing, and packet forwarding"" problem. Our work looked at how to answer fundamental control questions, such as where to place a processing function for best performance, or how to determine state changes in the system. We also prototyped a technique for automatically inferencing sources of network misconfigurations.

In our research, we designed a system that can track state changes in a software-defined network. The system is based on versioning different network states and attributing changes to sources in order to enable debugging. We developed a prototype system that can capture state information and make it easily accessible. In particular, the system is able to collect not only current network state information but also network configuration data. Only with configuration data, it is possible to understand the intent of a network operator. Thus, the combination of state and configuration information enables inferences on network faults.

To address the function placement question, we formulated a problem statement for this area that considers flow placement with constraints, and we developed a solution that can compute such a path efficiently. The primary idea is to transform the traditional routing problem in networks by merely modifying the structure of the network graph. Using a suitable metric that combines both link costs and processing costs, conventional shortest path algorithms can be used to solve this problem. To reflect dynamics, we exploit the ability of software-defined network controllers to collect runtime statistics from switches in the network to assess dynamic loads. We use models from queuing theory to translate this information into dynamic cost values for the placement problem.

Security issues were explored in the context of denial-of-service attacks on software-defined network controllers. We designed a defense mechanism, which requires systems wanting to connect through an SDN network to commit resources in the form of proof-of-work before an SDN controller commits resources for route computation and setup. Using this approach, an attacker needs to dedicate a large amount of computational resources in order to send large amounts of attack traffic that triggers route computation on the SDN controller, thus making an attack potentially prohibitively expensive.

The increasing complexity of networks together with increasing amounts of control and state information require automated tools for initial analysis. We designed and prototyped an automated system that can infer context and semantics. Our approach, based on natural language processing, shows how concepts, such as collocations, can be applied to network management data. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach to detect route prefix and sub-prefix hijacks.

We participated in an NSF I-Corps project based on ideas from this work. The team participated in the Summer 2016 Cohort #1 (Team #784 ""NetCeption""). A later PFI:AIRTT proposal was a result of this training.

The result of this work may enable new types of control mechanisms in software-defined networks. Future controller systems can leverage our placement algorithms, security features, and automated inference mechanisms. As a result, networks may operate more securely and robustly.

Beyond the broad applicability of our research results to the design of network exchange points, this project has offered extensive graduate student training. Results from our work have been disseminated in the form of a patent application and publications in peer-reviewed conferences.

The size of a telescope, given as the diameter of its main (primary) mirror, dictates how small it can see. Unfortunately even the largest telescopes ever built can barely get more than 4 pixels accross the largest stars. Moreoever much larger mirrors are currently impossible to build since they would sag under their own weight, while costing exponentially more money. And so it seemed stellar imaging was doomed before it could even take off...

Yet we would have a lot to learn from imaging the stars and their environments. From the images of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), these planetary systems in formation, we could understand which stellar systems may or may not develop planets with life-harboring conditions. From the images of stellar surfaces, we could understand the internal magnetism or convection conditions within the star, to better predict future solar storms. 

Forunately there exist a few techniques that can bypass the single telescope resolution limit. Among these, optical interferometry is the most powerful: by combining the light of several telescopes pointing simultaneously at the same target, astronomers obtain patterns of light known as fringes. In turn, full images can be reconstructed from these fringes thanks to interferometric imaging algorithms. The quality of the reconstruction depends both on the data signal-to-noise ratio and on the assumptions made during the reconstructions. While conventional algorithms have enjoyed reasonable successes on the simplest stars, they are very ill-suited to reconstruct complex objects such as YSOs or rotating stellar surface. Hence this project set up to remedy the situation by developing algorithms that could tackle these hard scenarios.

Initially we enhanced the classic algorithms so that they could exploit all the available data acquired at different epochs (times) and at different wavelengths (light colors). Then we introduced the notion of a generic model of stars they could use to guide the reconstruction. For example to model the stellar rotation, our algorithms need to determine the inclination of the star toward us, the amount of darkening spots undergo as they rotate out of view beyond the horizon of the star, and the rotation period of the star. Sometimes this rotation period is not unique and depends on the latitude of the star (such a differential rotation is actually seen on the Sun). We also realized we could tap into the power of Machine Learning, a sucessful computer science technique. Hence we began teaching our software to do what humans can inherently do, i.e. to recognize a stellar object by its features. For example a typical YSO would possess a central star surrounded by a ring of orbiting material, or sometimes a more opaque disc of matter. Meanwhile a spotted star looks like a stellar disc with roundish features on its surface. With this knowledge, even in the presence of very noisy data, our codes can retrieve a ""best"" image that beat all previous algorithms by a very significant margin.

As soon as our algorithms were fully functional, we tested them on the relevant science cases. Thus we recently published two articles in Nature with the highest resolution images ever obtained of spotted stars, first in the case where spots are due to magnetism, and then in the case where they are due to convection. We also recently detected and imaged the differential rotation on the surface of a rotating star. And these are only the first images of future hundreds, as interferometers are only starting to go toward fainter and smaller objects. Finally we have also just initiated very promising studies of spot evolution, to understand what drives the formation and disappearance of these spots.

So what about YSO imaging ? With the algorithms ready, all we needed was good data... Unfortunately, while we did manage to collect the highest resolution data ever on YSOs, the final signal-to-noise and quantity of the data did not allow us to reconstruct scientifically useful images, due to an inherent noise limit of our instruments. Yet not all is lost, since in the process we fully analyzed what was needed for imaging fainter objects. It is with this knowledge that we recently started to upgrade the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy array with Adaptive Optics and low-noise infrared camera. Once the upgrades are completed in 2018, we will be able to immediately image YSOs with the state-of-the-art algorithms developed during this project.

A good resource of annotated datasets and annotation tools is particularly important in research involving physical human limitations, persons with chronic disabilities, such as post-stroke, ALS, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Cerebral Palsy, and others. Currently, a comprehensive community CRI with human activity data and analysis tools is not in place. The development of new methods and algorithms that will improve and enable real-world motion tracking applications is hampered by an inherent difficulty: the lack of large sets of training and testing data. This planning activity brings together experts in computer vision, machine learning, data mining, user interface design, assistive environments, human robot interaction, databases research, big data involving real time human activity, therapists, clinicians, device makers and sensor developers in order to identify the specific human activity data that should be collected and processed when building a repository of automatically and accurately annotated video data of human motion.

Specifically, a repository of automatically and accurately annotated video data of human motion has the potential to impact the research of several disciplines using human motion tracking and recognition by significantly improving the ability to recognize behavioral markers for assessing the confluence of environment, drugs, human psychology and thus extend clinical and psychological areas. However, due to big data issues (volume, velocity, variety, veracity, arising from multisensory visual input of human behavior), the tasks of automating data collection and especially annotation are non-trivial. Traditionally, video data of human motion are collected and annotated manually. Due to the large amount of data generated by video sensors, this task is very tedious and error prone. For this reason, most existing datasets are very small and specialized to the problem for which they were collected.

Introduction

The objective of the CI-P planning grant Smart Move Project is to research the creation of a large and comprehensive community repository of human motion activity that enables researchers in the field to understand human behavior and intent.  Such a repository is currently not in place.
Motivation

The collection and analysis of human motion data is often done manually, a task that is tedious and error prone, due to the large amounts of data generated by the video sensors. Thus, most existing datasets are small and specialized to a particular problem for which they were collected. The Smart-Move planning project was to organize meetings and workshops to collect community feedback as to the type of CRI resource needed and how to design it, what data to collect and annotate, how to overcome operational obstacles associated with recognizing human motion and its feasibility and applicability. A community of users was identified for whom the proposed repository would enhance their productivity and advance their research.
Summary of Planning Activities

During the planning period, the PIs invited ~50 world experts to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing datasets and ways to address the lacking infrastructure. The PIs planned several workshops, made the planning activities known in many conferences and meetings they attended, including conferences such as Petra (www.petrae.org). Invited speakers and panel participants addressed (1) Appropriate human motion activity data to be collected and sensors to be used; (2) Development of tools for automatic data annotation, searching and others; (3) Automatic ""event recognition"" and ""data summarization"" and (4) Feasibility of the community infrastructure.
Project Outcomes and Findings
Through the many research contacts that were established, research needs and opportunities were identified and related to ongoing challenges of algorithm development and optimization for big data applications, as well as related work in machine learning, data mining, big data analysis, software engineering, and embedded systems. The outcomes and findings include the following:

1. Understanding human behavior from motion activity is a very complex big data problem that requires the collection and fusion of large amounts of multisensing data and interdisciplinary expertise. This is particularly true if human motion is to be used to understand conditions such as, stress, fatigue, deception, drowsiness, excitement, pain, etc.  Thus, focusing on specific applications of national strategic importance is a reasonable approach.
2. In preparation for a community CRI proposal, the PIs put together a multidisciplinary team of experts in the area of human motion activity as related to vocational training. Two NSF grant proposals were prepared, one of them funded (PFI) and the other one pending (CPS).
3. A medium IIS &ndash; CRI proposal was submitted (no. 1629924), entitled, ""CRI Proposal: II-New: Big Data Analytics Research Accelerator (BDA)"", to study how to overcome big data challenges in building a human activity repository. The BDA proposal aimed to overcome obstacles such as, being able to quickly test an algorithm, reproduce research across applications, or to quickly evaluate work through experimentation. It was to develop critical CRI infrastructure using open-source solutions for big data, to enable researchers to look up and compare information quickly, without having to go down into fine-grain detail about the data.  This proposal was not funded but it provided a valuable resource to develop a future CRI community grant.
Intellectual Merit

The project offers scientists an advanced integrative computational infrastructure that tags data semantically, making it easier to test hypotheses, recognize new relationships and explore different research alternatives through a one stop distributed repository infrastructure. The Smart Move repository can advance discovery by enabling information researchers to express their algorithms more expressively, enable easy reproducibility of experiments, reference and query different data sources, support data-intensive research activities, accelerate research through the abstraction of implementation details, and foster cross-disciplinary research.
Broader Impacts

The project facilitates data sharing and collaboration among its users, leads to a deeper understanding of a problem, provides ways to compare findings, and enables the creation of new relationships among datasets that may lead to unexpected discoveries. Applications include: Healthcare (improve healthcare training and delivery, identify best practices, improve decision-making, and provide access to computational resources to novices); Manufacturing (work efficiency/safety), Training (shorten learning curve); Cybersecurity and Privacy. The project provides rich and compelling resources to engage students into Big Data Science research.

Title: Retinal Nanophotoswitch

Significance 
The objective of the proposed research is to develop a novel neurophotonic molecular switch for light-activation of neurons. A visual prosthesis based on this nanophotoswitch (NPS) has the potential to improve the visual acuity for the millions of patients suffering from retinal degenerative diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. This proposal is very innovative. The biophysical mechanism is completely differentiated from electrical devices and other molecular photo-switch-based approaches. Beyond vision restoration, it is a generally useful approach for controlling excitable cells. If successful, it may have a great impact on patients who are underserved by current treatments. 

The interdisciplinary research provides excellent educational opportunities for participating graduate and undergraduate students. The proposing team has an exceptional record on inclusion of women, under-represented minorities, and undergraduates in their research. They also have a good track record on outreach to the local community, and planned outreach activities include Research Experience for Teachers and activities for K-12 students.

Technical Description 
Nanophotoswitch (NPS) offers a new tool to elicit electrical activity for basic science studies of neuronal function, both in vitro and also potentially in vivo. The hypothesis is based on the NPS design and results of pilot experiments, that light induces an electrical dipole in the NPS. Preliminary data indicate that an NPS based on ruthenium bipyridine (Rubpy) inserts into cell membranes and upon visible-wavelength illumination triggers action potentials in cultured excitable cells and in wholemount rat retina. When injected into the eye of blind photoceptor-degenerate rats, visual stimulation induces electrical activity in the superior colliculus. It was also demonstrated that NPS can both depolarize or hyperpolarize the membrane, depending on the environmental redox potential. This unique combination of bi-directional modulation of the membrane potential in one biophotonic switch affords the ability to both activate and inhibit the action potential firing of the illuminated cells with the same molecule, presenting largely increased flexibility in neuronal control. The NPS would be useful in studying any electrically excitable cell, including, for example, cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, neuroendocrine cells, and certain glial and cancer cells. Since light-activated signaling unit is individual neurons, a visual prosthesis based on NPS system has the potential to provide higher visual acuity for the millions of patients with photoreceptor loss due to retinal degenerative diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Distinct from other nano-scale optical cellular modulating approaches using optogenetics or azobenzene-based photoswitches, this approach obviates the need for gene manipulation, toxic ultraviolet illumination or immunogenic molecules, due to the unique light-to-electrical signal transduction mechanism of the NPS.",,,"Intellectual Merit

A range of approaches has recently been developed for remote control of nerve cell activity using light stimulation. We set out to test the efficacy of synthetic nanophotoswitches (NPSs) in conferring light-induced electrical activity in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. We generated a large range of the NPSs and demonstrated at cellular and retinal wholemount level that ruthenium, rhenium, and iridium-based complexes do confer light-induced membrane potential changes in neurons.

The NPSs can either depolarize or hyperpolarize the membrane, depending on the environmental redox potential. The ability to confer bi-directional modulation of the membrane potential with one biophotonic switch largely increases flexibility in neuronal control. In addition, use of NPSs obviates the time and effort typically spent on gene expression or protein modification, such as is required for other photo-modulation approaches.

NPSs offer a new tool to elicit electrical activity for basic science studies of neuronal function, both in vitro and also potentially in vivo. In combination with high-resolution optical system for multi-loci photo-stimulation, we may establish a high-throughput platform for fine-grained analysis on a variety of neural networks. By changing the spatial and temporal parameters of the pixels we can generate various illumination patterns that could find extensive applications, for example, in the mapping of neural circuits.

The basic aspects of our work have been protected by a non-provisional patent that was awarded this year.

Broader impacts of the work

Supported by the present grant funding, as well as by the NSF Innovation Corps Team Program, we have presented our work nationally and internationally and verified that there is keen interest in and a potential commercial market for a treatment based on NPS injection to restore some level of vision in patients at advanced stages age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the most common acquired and inherited causes of adult blindness.

Treatment with NPSs may offer AMD and RP patients far greater visual acuity than the Argus II microchip implant (and other epi- or sub-retinal implants), as the light-activated signaling unit is an individual neuron, rather than groups of neurons near an electrode; NPSs are also less invasive, avoiding surgical positioning of foreign microelectronics near the retina; they do not require gene therapy; and they require only one excitation wavelength and avoid use of cytotoxic ultraviolet light.

The Site will provide infrastructure, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to I-Corps entrepreneurial teams. With this grant, UMN leverages and extends its assets in science and engineering, research, entrepreneurship education, and technology commercialization to create the Minnesota Innovation Corps (MIN-Corps). 

MIN-Corps will: 
1. Expand UMN's outreach to its STEM researchers - faculty, postdoctoral, graduate students, and undergraduates - to engage more of them in the process of translating discoveries and technological developments into commercializable products. 
2. Train entrepreneurial talent through STARTUP, a course that incorporates the Lean LaunchPad concepts and tools. 
3. Provide modest, early-stage funding ($1,000 to $3,000) to approximately 30 entrepreneurial teams per year who are engaged in the course and show potential, bridging the funding gap between early stage development and translation into the market. 
4. Support ongoing customer development and commercialization efforts by connecting teams with UMN and community resources. 
5. Leverage research expertise to contribute to and support collaborative program evaluation and research across the national I-Corps network. 

By engaging teams from UMN's STEM research base, MIN-Corps will create new ventures based on sustainable business models and customer-focused product design. MIN-Corps will prepare teams to seek follow-on funding through public grants and private investment. MIN-Corps will engage with stakeholders to make broader impacts in the community including: 
Talent Development. MIN-Corps will expand awareness of resources supporting innovation and entrepreneurship among students and faculty in STEM fields, particularly among women and under-represented groups. The training experience offered to high-potential entrepreneurial team members through the STARTUP course will increase their readiness for innovation roles in industry and infuse a more entrepreneurial mindset in UMN's culture. 
Network Development. MIN-Corps will expand UMN's current engagement with seasoned entrepreneurs, angel investors, and venture capitalists from the local innovation ecosystem as mentors throughout the educational and commercialization process. The program will also help harness the energy of individuals and organizations currently supporting entrepreneurship and innovation across Minnesota, including 19 Fortune 500 companies that make their home in the state.
Economic Development. MIN-Corps will increase the translation rate of STEM-based innovation to new commercial ventures positioned for subsequent funding from NSF I-Corps, SBIR, NCIIA E-Teams, accelerators, incubators, competitions, angel investors and venture capitalists. The program will spur economic prosperity by expanding access to Lean Launchpad training and increasing the number of start-ups, entrepreneurs, and high-tech jobs in the state.",,,"During its first five years, the University of Minnesota (UMN) I-Corps Site, MIN-Corps, delivered technology commercialization education and coaching to 3,516 individuals and 301 teams that raised $12.7 million in commercialization grants and/or equity investment.  Thirteen (13) teams have participated in the I-Corps National Teams program, with 4 more accepted into second-half 2019 cohorts. MIN-Corps generated 22 startups, 7 of which attracted SBIR, STTR or PFI grants. Seventy two percent (72%) of the MIN-Corps innovation team members were affiliated with the College of Science and Engineering, with the balance coming from 21 other University of Minnesota colleges.  We positioned I-Corps training as a form of professional development, not just to commercialize specific technologies.  As a result, 45% of participating innovators were graduate students and postdocs, 37% were undergraduates, 9% were staff, 8% were faculty and 1% were external to the University. 

The MIN-Corps Lean LaunchPad workshops have earned a 75% Net Promoter Score from participants (meaning that they would recommend the program to a friend or colleague, and about 95% indicated that the programs increased their understanding of commercialization ?a lot? or ?a great deal.?  To achieve these results, MIN-Corps applied a four-part theory of change:  Building Awareness (seminars on commercialization considerations and opportunities), Building Skills (Lean LaunchPad for-credit courses as well as noncredit workshops), Building Connections (with a mentor pool of over 200 industry leaders and entrepreneurs), and Ongoing Support (through ongoing coaching and strategy clinics).  Lean LaunchPad content has been incorporated into senior design courses in Biomedical Engineering (since Fall 2016) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (since Fall 2018). 

We have made a focused effort to attract women to MIN-Corps teams, with about 36% female participation ? in addition to outreach to various women?s academic organizations, we also built a pipeline of female STEM innovators through the MIN-Corps annual Women Innovators Conference.  Other outreach efforts included the Walleye Tank life science venture competition in collaboration with Mayo Clinic, joint programming with MN-SBIR (the State of Minnesota SBIR navigator), and the Medical Devices Industry Connect customer discovery program at UMN?s Design of Medical Devices Conference in collaboration with the I-Corps Midwest Node. Finally, we strengthened the connection between the UMN Carlson School of Management and STEM innovators through MIN-Corps Fellows, a program in which teams of MBA students work with University of Minnesota scientists to advance the commercialization of their innovations.

A diagnostic aid that can provide a quantitative correlation for both diagnosis and efficacy of treatment is sorely needed. This team has developed a technology that will facilitate point-of-care monitoring of cortisol, the key stress biomarker, by measuring its levels in body fluids. The proposed technology promises to advance the level of health care for military patients with PTSD. It also has the potential to reach other market segments, such as farm workers and fire fighters, who might also benefit from alternative treatments to stress-induced conditions based on the near real-time measurement of cortisol concentrations in saliva.

The proposed cortisol sensing technology is a transformative technology that enables monitoring of stress levels non-invasively using a nanoengineered biochip and a handheld measurement unit. The nanoengineered biochip is both low cost and disposable. The proposed technology will enable quantitative correlations to observed medical conditions and help improve the efficacy of treatment through monitoring of the stress hormone cortisol as the patient continues to be in the care of the doctors.  This portable sensor accurately measures cortisol levels, a known indicator of stress in 30 minutes.  The accuracy of the sensor would lead to a new class of tests that would provide quantitative information for difficult to diagnose diseases like PTSD, while significantly reducing the time to diagnosis.",,,"There has been an increased interest in developing technologies that measure stress levels periodically or continuously to avoid chronic psychological stress and associated pathophysiological risks With the assistance of the I-Corps program, we evaluated both the market needs and market constraints of the biochemical sensing technology for monitoring stress related biomarker from an economic perspective.. Cortisol, a stress biomarker, is an important steroid hormone correlated with stress levels in humans. The cortisol sensing technology we developed enables non-invasive monitoring of this stress hormone?s levels. Currently available cortisol sensing technologies are laborious and thereby not suitable for measuring cortisol levels in a point of care environment. These tests are expensive and can cost the user approximately $ 65-85 USD per test (inclusive of lab fees), yielding results in a lengthy four to seven days. Our technology aims to reduce the cost of testing by an order of magnitude (to under $10 per test) while providing immediate results, thus enabling the adoption of the technology as the critical tool for monitoring treatment  efficacy .  We have validated the cortisol measurements of our technology against a widely used diagnostic enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) resulting in collaborations with several groups to validate the sensor performance in scale. The fabricated electrochemical sensor exhibits a detection range from 10 pg/ml to 100 ng/ml, a detection limit of 10 pg/ml, and a sensitivity of 6 &mu;A/(mg/mL)  Sensor stability needs to be quantified large scales to establish the validity of the sensor as a clinical tool. This is being pursued as the final step towards commercialization  On a parallel track, we refined the sensor design by integrating the sensor with a microfluidic platform for volume efficiency and increased transport of sample. An electronic interface for the sensor was also developed for hand-held measurements. The miniaturized hand-held device has a microprocessor programmed to perform cyclic voltammetry to obtain cortisol levels in a saliva sample, which will then be compared to a chart that contains corresponding stress levels. This easy to use sensing device functions through a ultra-low power potentiostat to increase the battery efficiency. In order to assess the market, we visited sports trainers and medical doctors to further confirm the specific niche of possible groups that would benefit from our technology of our technology. By collaborating with experts in behavioral medicine, we have commenced the development of protocols to examine the reliability of the sensor in detecting cortisol patterns across other at-risk clinical populations. A proposal has been submitted to NSF-Partnerships for Innovation: Accelerating Innovation Research- Technology Translation (PFI: AIR-TT) to translate the cortisol sensing technology to produce a cost-effective biosensing device for monitoring cortisol levels non-invasively and diagnosing stress-related disorders. The interviews also helped identify compelling parallel needs in sensing that have also been prototyped in the lab.

This center has been devised to concentrate and deploy resources and people to launch a transformation in ubiquitous diagnostics by creating the tools, methods, and technologies for integrated microfluidics that will enable low&#8208;cost, simple, rapid assessment anywhere and everywhere - agriculture, food and water supplies, and ultimately for human health and safety.

The outcomes from this NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) are multifaceted. First and foremost, CADMIM brings together a multi&#8208;disciplinary team of researchers and institutions. This center incorporates a novel emphasis on design-oriented research that anticipates the need for cost-effective manufacture and practical deployment and a simultaneous, broad-front integrated strategy that seeks breakthroughs at the interfaces of engineering, material science and processing, biology, chemistry, medicine, device design, electronics, and component integration. Productive, long-term collaborative partnerships between universities and industry have been forged over the 5-year award. The composition of the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) has included both large and small firms spanning a variety of business spaces (healthcare, consumer products, agricultural biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, materials, scalable manufacturing, and software).

These multidisciplinary teams of IAB members and academics have defined and executed cutting-edge lab-on-a-chip research projects, resulting in new microfluidic platforms capable of integrated high fidelity particle separation (cells, beads, molecules in both continuous streams and droplets), tissue dissociation, sensing analytes in biofluid (blood, sweat, and urine from humans and xylem from plants), sample purification, and combinatorial chemistry. The functions demonstrated in these platforms either meet of exceed the performance of comparable systems, in a portable, potentially manufacturable format that will ultimately reduce the cost/test. Results have been disseminated through publications, invention disclosures, and patent applications. During the first 5 years, CADMIM published 33 journal papers and 13 conference papers. CADMIM also produced 14 invention disclosures from center-funded research projects. Of these, 9 were converted to provisional patents and 6 ultimately became non-provisional patent applications.

CADMIM has also provides a unique blend of academic-industrial training for the next generation of researchers and educators. Quite often postdocs mentor graduate students, who in turn mentor undergraduate students in the labs. Also, with the emphasis on manufacturability of the labs-on-a-chip being developed at the center, all students and post-docs are being exposed to issues of scalability and market drivers (cost, throughput, performance, world-to-chip interfaces, etc.). Both UC Irvine and U. Illinois Chicago have competitive recruitment mechanisms and attractive cross-disciplinary graduate research opportunities to engage excellent students, including members of underrepresented groups (both sites are federally designated Minority Serving Institutions). All students and post-docs participate in semi-annual CADMIM IAB meetings, where valuable in-person interaction with the IAB members takes place.

During the 5-year award, the center involved 14 post-docs, 40 PhD students, 9 masters students, and numerous undergraduate students in center-funded research. 6 undergraduates were officially supported via a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) supplement, and 3 PhD graduate students received NSF INTERN supplements to do internships with an IAB member. Several other graduate students at both sites had internships in industry, facilitated by CADMIM and paid by the company, prior to graduation. Having an industrial component to their training has helped students and post-docs understand the industrial perspective, provided invaluable contacts in the commercial sector, and eased the transition from university to company after graduation. Over 90% of graduate students and post-docs took jobs in industry (either at an established firm or at a start-up company). Those in academia accepted post-doc positions or faculty.

Finally, CADMIM has made a conscious effort to translate center research projects into the commercial sector. Faculty have taken advantage of the NSF Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) funding opportunities where teams of faculty and IAB members have successfully received funds to move CADMIM research closer to commercialization. Faculty have also initiated sponsored research projects with IAB members as follow-ons to CADMIM research projects. Finally, center faculty and students have started new companies to commercialize CADMIM co-funded research. Teams have successfully captured SBIR funds as well as funds from private investors since CADMIM's inception. Proactive emphasis on volume production and on-chip interfaces to existing communications infrastructure are new research priorities for the microfluidics field. Yet these considerations early in the research and design cycle are key to transitioning technologies out of academic laboratories and into the manufacturing sector for the benefit of the general population.

The translated smart MC-MD micro-GC has the following distinct advantages when compared with conventional 1-dimensional micro-GC or comprehensive 2-D micro-GC in the market or under development in labs. (1) It has unprecedented peak capacity and peak capacity efficiency while remaining portable, which arise from the long high-dimensional separation afforded by the smart GC design; (2) It can be scaled up to higher dimensional separation (such as 3-D or 4-D micro-GC) easily; (3) It does not require complicated thermal modulators widely used in comprehensive 2-D GC systems, thus substantially simplifying the GC design, fabrication, and power consumption; (4) Construction of the multi-dimensional (not only 2-D but also higher dimensional) chromatogram becomes straightforward by reading the retention time of each analyte directly from the vapor detector installed at the end of the each separation column; and (5) the detection limit is improved 3-10 fold, since the entire analyte is sent to the downstream column, rather than just a slice of it as in the conventional comprehensive 2-D GC. The project accomplishes this goal by prototyping a fully functional 1x2x4-channel smart 3-D micro-GC, which will include the following tasks: (1) assembly of all micro-GC components, (2) development of the corresponding operation/analysis algorithm, (3) performance evaluation using 100 vapor analytes, (4) assessment of market potential and commercialization feasibility, and (5) technical and entrepreneurial training of under/graduate students and post-doctors. The potential economic impact is expected to be a few billion US dollars in the next ten years which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in fields as diverse as agricultural and food industry, winery, environment monitoring/protection, healthcare, and homeland security/battlefield.
Broader impact: Smart 3-D micro-GC has unprecedented peak capacity, easy operation, and simple 3-D chromatogram construction and thus will have a broad range of applications in environmental monitoring, homeland security, battlefield, industries, and healthcare. The students and the post-doctor will receive rigorous technical and entrepreneurial training and mentoring. Additionally, the team will work closely with the Master of Entrepreneurship Program at the University of Michigan to assess the market opportunities and viability of smart 3-D micro-GC.

GC is a standard instrument for analyzing vapor analytes. However, bench-top GC systems are bulky, slow, and power intensive. They are usually housed in a centralized lab with dedicated personnel and cannot be used for field or point-of-care applications. mGC is a miniaturized version of the bench-top GC with portability and high-speed analysis capability. The smart multi-dimensional mGC architecture developed in this proposal is fundamentally different. Using the flow-through non-destructive vapor detectors installed on-column and the flow routing system, separation at each dimension can be independently controlled and optimized. Therefore, smart multi-dimensional mGC enables arbitrarily long separation time and hence the unprecedented peak capacity. In particular, such architecture is highly scalable. Higher-dimensional separation can be added by simply attaching more GC columns to the preceding columns. In addition to vastly enhanced GC peak capacity, smart multi-dimensional GC does not require complicated thermal modulators widely used in comprehensive 2-D GC systems, thus substantially simplifying the GC design, fabrication, and power consumption. Finally, construction of the multi-dimensional (not only 2-D but also higher dimensional!) chromatogram becomes straightforward by reading the retention time of each analyte directly from the vapor detector installed at the end of the each column, in contrast to the complicated re-construction procedures and sophisticated software used in comprehensive 2-D GC.

 

Broader impact: 

Multi-dimensional mGC having unprecedented peak capacity, easy operation, and simple multi-dimensional chromatogram construction will have a broad range of applications in environmental monitoring, homeland security, battlefield, industries, and healthcare. The students and the post-doctor will receive rigorous technical training and close mentoring from the PI, and entrepreneurial training from a venture capitalist and former founder/CEO at a successful startup. Additionally, the team will work closely with the Master of Entrepreneurship Program at the University of Michigan to assess the market opportunities and viability of smart multi-dimensional mGC. Dissemination of knowledge will include journal publications, conference presentations, patent filing, public seminars, and demonstration of the prototype at the science/technology exhibits in the Detroit area.

 

Major activities and findings:

In the past 2 years, under the support of this NSF grant, we have published 1 peer reviewed journal article and submitted two additional manuscripts. In addition, we submitted 3 conference papers and filed one provisional patent.

We have successfully designed, fabricated, and tested all micro-GC related components such as micro-pre-concentrator, micro-thermal injector, micro-GC columns, micro-Deans switches, and microfluidic photo-ionization detectors (see Fig. 1). We have also constructed 1x1 2-D micro-GC and 1x4 2-D micro-GC, which can easily be scaled up to 3-D micro-GC (see Fig. 2). Figure 3 shows an example of separating 50 different types of vapor molecules in 700 seconds.

During the project, we have trained two graduate students. These two graduate students received an internal grant to attend the Engineering Translational Research training. They also attended the NSF Grantee Workshop at Atlanta in June of 2014.

Through the project, one undergraduate was trained under NSF REU (Research Experience for Undergraduate). A few other undergraduate students were trained under the UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program) sponsored by the University of Michigan.

Last year a project report was submitted and the current project report describes some of the work done under a no cost extension period. A scientific paper entitled ""Optically transparent superhydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane by periodic surface microtexture"" was published in Surface and Coatings Technology Journal (volume 325, pages 308-317, 2017).  The prepared samples exhibited optical transparency between 43% and 72% while retaining static contact angles above 150&deg;, as the percent area without microtexture is increased from 53.8% to 81%. The samples replicated from the aluminum master exhibit roll-off angles of below 2&deg;, samples produced using a polycarbonate master exhibited an almost complete loss of roll-off angle performance. This is a consequence of the microtexture profile being inverted at each embossing step. Another manuscript entitled ""Low Ice Adhesion Surfaces Using Microtextured Hydrophobic Tapes and Their Applications in Refrigeration Systems"" is under preparation for submission to a scientific journal.

The broader impact of the project was training of undergraduate and graduate students, performed outreach activities and developed economic impact through the transition of the technology to industry. The project provided support to three undergraduate students under NSF research experience for undergraduate (REU) program. A collaboration with refrigeration systems company was established for the transition of the technology and it is on-going with the preparation of joint invention disclosure. A novel application of the developed technology for refrigeration systems is being pursued.

Summary: The overall goal of the project is the transition of replicated laser microtextured surface technology through scalable process and reliability testing. Replicated laser microtextured samples were prepared and showed superhydrophobic properties. Since one of the major goal of this project is the transition of the technology to industry, we have contacted over 50 companies and have found a novel application for refrigeration systems. We have started a collaborative work with industry and additional intellectual property has been generated. The university of Virginia licensing and ventures group is working with the refrigeration systems company for commercialization of the technology.

The translated smart-cache solution consists of a suite of strategies to extend traditional dedup to mobile environments, and has the following unique features: (1) Asymmetric caching, which allows the dedup destination (dd-dst) to feedback to the dd-src the contents of its cache that otherwise might not be known to the dedup source (dd-src). (2) PreActing, that allows the dd-dst to opportunistically prefetch content when the latter is connected through a low-cost network access so that when such content is actually accessed through a high-cost network, the costs may be minimized. 

The research contributions of these two variations lie in the underlying algorithms that are purpose-built to handle the unique challenges present in mobile environments. Preliminary trace-based performance analysis shows that smart-cache significantly improves the performance by reducing traffic consumption over cellular networks to the tune of 85% to 96%. Asymmetric caching by itself shows an improvement of 125% over symmetric caching.

The project accomplishes this goal by developing a viable prototype of the smart-cache solution so that an important credibility gap in the commercialization process for the technology may be addressed. While there are several avenues for productizing the smart-cache solution, we choose to build a prototype that could be adopted by both wireless network operators and third party solution providers. At a high level, we propose to build the following:
- Smart-cache server: The project involves the building of a smart-cache server as a stand-alone network appliance that can be deployed within the wireless operators network or within a proxy environment of a third-party solutions provider. Building such an appliance allows for ready deployment in a target environment without concerns about the availability of computational resources. While the product form will be that of an appliance, the implementation will entirely be in software running on a Linux operating system. Hence, the prototype can easily be ported onto virtual machines in the target environment if necessary. 
- Smart-cache clients: The project involves the building of a smart-cache client for both Android and iOS devices. These two mobile platforms by far dominate the mobile device landscape today. While operating systems such as Windows Mobile and Blackberry RIM are other relevant platforms, solutions can later be developed or ported for these other platforms after the proposed prototyping effort is successfully accomplished.

The partnership engages the Georgia Tech VentureLab to provide guidance in wireless market dynamics and other aspects of commercialization and productization as they pertain to the potential to translate smart-cache along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.

The potential economic impact of smart-cache is profound, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in telecommunication industry. A wireless service provider could adopt smart-cache to immediately reduce the usage of expensive spectrum. Alternatively, a third party solutions provider could offer smart-cache as a cost and performance optimization service directly to the end-user. The project also makes the following broader impact contributions: (i) Industry: 85% of enterprise knowledge workers are expected to have smartphones within the next few years. The work on smart-cache will directly benefit the broad swathe of enterprises as better mobile access will improve employee productivity and customer engagement. (ii) Education: In addition we see the effort positively impacting both undergraduate and graduate level students through aggressive involvement of the students in both research and teaching.",,,"The Adoption of mobile devices such as smartphones has reached a significant threshold with the number of such devices shipped now surpassing the number of PCs shipped. Nearly 40% of Internet time is now attributed to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Not only are consumers adopting mobile devices at a blistering pace, but such adoption is being witnessed within the traditionally conservative enterprise sector as well. 71% of enterprises are currently deploying or planning the deployment of mobile applications. Such adoption amongst enterprises is driven by a clear return-on-investment from mobility in the form of higher employee productivity, reduced paper work, and increased revenue [4]. An ever-increasing pressure on wireless network performance and scalability, however, accompanies such exciting trends.

 

Cellular technologies such as 3G and 4G, in tandem with WiFi, serve as the fundamental access mechanisms for mobile users. While WiFi operates in the ISM band, and hence is free to deploy, cellular providers purchase cellular wireless spectrum at FCC auctions and pay billions of dollars for licenses. The recent FCC auctions for spectrum in the 700MHz band resulted in approximately 50MHz of spectrum purchased for close to $20 Billion. Thus, wireless service providers are heavily motivated to continually improve efficiencies of how such spectrum is used.

 

At a high level, a wireless service provider has three strategies to scale in terms of the number of users or the data rates supported: (i) buy more spectrum; (ii) increase the efficiency of using spectrum; and (iii) decrease network load. While buying more spectrum is clearly undesirable from a cost standpoint, increasing spectral efficiencies and reducing network load are lower-cost alternatives that are attractive.  Specifically, several recent studies have established that there are considerable redundancies in the network traffic and application usage patterns that are not fully leveraged by application layer solutions.

 

In this context, we have developed smart-cache, a suite of solutions that leverages these redundancies to obtain better network, application and user performance. Smart-cache consists of the following four solutions:

Asymmetric caching (smart-cache-linklayer) is a link layer solution that saves bytes transported on the network by caching packets on both the mobile device and sources (typically at the AP or SGSN) and eliminating transmission of redundant bytes by only transmitting hashes of the cached data. Asymmetric caching solution involves algorithms that maintain a uniform cache state among different sources with low overhead. 
Precog (smart-cache-network) solution allows the mobile device user to save valuable cellular data access costs by opportunistically prefetching content on mobile device, when it is connected through a low-cost network access so that when such content is accessed through a high cost network in the future, the costs may be minimized. Precog utilizes the redundancy in network access actions performed by a user on a browser/application to predict and prefetch content the user is likely to access in the future. 
Peek (smart-cache-transport) is a novel remote computing protocol that allows a smartphone user to remotely access and operate any other smartphone (of other users, or virtual images in the cloud) and interact with it seamlessly as if she was interacting with it locally. It provides multi-touch support, associates sensor context, and uses a compression technique that leverages redundancies in the application usage to save bytes transported over the network. 
DejaVu (smart-cache-application) solves the email overload problem by aiding the user through automatic reply construction. DejaVu suggests possible replies to an email by mining answers to the questions asked in the incoming email from other emails in the account. This is a work in progress. In this project, we developed an analysis tool ?De...",

As we originally proposed, the major goal of this project is to develop the transformational N-doping technologies to produce carbon-based, metal-free cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts for fuel cells with drastically low cost and high efficiency. Specifically, we have scaled up the production of vertically-aligned and non-aligned N-doped carbon nanotubes (VA-NCNTs and NA-NCNTs, respectively) through the vapor-phase pyrolysis of FePc in the presence or absence of NH3 under different conditions. We have also developed CVD and ball milling methods for large-scale low-cost production of N-doped graphene. From them, various carbon-based (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene) metal-free ORR catalysts were developed for both alkaline and acidic fuel cells, including PMFCs. Metal-free catalysts based on carbon hybrids (e.g., N-doped graphene-supported carbon nitrides, graphene nanoribbon-supported graphene quantum dots) were also developed for efficient oxygen reduction. Apart from the ORR testing in electrochemical cells, the resultant NCNTs and N-doped graphene materials have been made into MEAs for single fuel cell performance and durability testing. Furthermore, we have also developed N,P-codoped graphene materials as efficient metal-free bifunctional ORR-OER catalysts for high-performance rechargeable Zn-air batteries and N-doped graphene nanoribbons as efficient metal-free counter electrode for disulfide/thiolate redox mediated dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

Along with the experimental investigation, we have developed first-principles modeling for ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on heteroatom-(co)doped graphene. In particular, density functional theory (DFT) was applied to study sulfur-doped graphene cluster as ORR cathode catalysts for fuel cells. We have also performed theoretical modeling to understand the mechanism of ORR and OER catalyzed by a bifunctional catalyst, N-P co-doped graphene. ORR and OER overpotentials and reaction energy barriers were calculated for various doped structures. Our preliminary results explain why the N-P co-doped graphene has high catalytic activities and work in both acidic and alkaline environment. In addition, graphene sheets adsorbed with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) molecules were predicated by first principles calculations to act as an efficient metal-free catalyst for ORR and OER. These calculations suggest that engineering the edge structures of the graphene can increase the efficiency of the heteroatom-doped graphene materials as metal-free catalysts for metal-air batteries, water splitting, and regenerative fuel cells.

On the basis of these theoretical and experimental studies, we have published about 30 journal publications, including Sci. Adv. (2), Nat. Nanotechnol. (1), Chem. Rev. (1), Acc. Chem. Res. (1), Adv. Mater. (3), Angew. Chem. (5), JACS (1), and ACS Nano (1) papers. Our work has also received numerous commentaries appeared in scientific, business, and popular press (please see: ""Events &amp; News"" at http://case.edu/cse/eche/daigroup/index.html). This project has led to not only a strong fundamental understanding of new scientific principles for the carbon-based metal-free catalysts for energy-related reactions, but also innovative approaches to new catalytic materials and energy devices for a broad range of applications in the field of clean energy conversion technologies (e.g. fuel cells, batteries, solar cells). The education impact includes the creation of an environment where all-level students (graduate, undergraduate, high school, and students from underrepresented groups) from multidisciplinary background work together on the development of a common platform. A special effort has been made to encourage participation of student(s) from under-represented groups. Indeed, three undergraduate students have actively participated in our research on the part-time basis. One undergrapduate student has successfully graduated f...",CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY

According to the US Energy Information Administration, buildings consume more energy than any other sector, with 48.7% of the overall energy consumption, and building energy consumption is projected to grow faster than the consumptions of industry and transportation sectors.  As a response to this, by 2030 only 18% of the US building stock is expected to be relying on the current energy management technologies, with the rest either having been retrofitted or designed from the ground up using smart and cleaner energy technologies. These building energy management systems (BEMSs) need to integrate large volumes of data, including (a) continuously collected heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) sensor and actuation data, (b) other sensory data, such as occupancy, humidity, lighting levels, air speed and quality, (c) architectural, mechanical, and building automation system configuration data for these buildings, (d) local whether and GIS data that provide contextual information, as well as (e) energy price, consumption, and cost data from electricity (such as smart grid) and gas utilities.  In theory, these data can be leveraged from the initial design and/or retrofitting of buildings with data driven building optimization (including the evaluation of the building location, orientation, and alternative energy-saving strategies) to total cost of ownership (TCOs) simulation tools and day-to-day operation decisions. In practice, however, because of the size and complexity of the data, the varying spatial and temporal scales at which the key processes operate, (a) creating models to support such simulations, (b) executing simulations that involve 100s of inter-dependent parameters spanning multiple spatio-temporal frames, affected by complex dynamic processes operating at different resolutions, and (c) analyzing simulation results are extremely costly.  The energy simulation data management system (e-SDMS) software will address challenges that arise from the need to model, index, search, visualize, and analyze, in a scalable manner, large volumes of multi-variate series resulting from observations and simulations. e-SDMS will, therefore, fill an important hole in data-driven building design and clean-energy (an area of national priority) and will enable applications and services with significant economic and environmental impact.

The key observations driving the research is that many data sets of urgent interest to energy simulations include the following: (a) voluminous, (b) heterogeneous, (c) multi-variate, (d) temporal, (e) inter-related (meaning that the parameters of interest are dependent on each other and constrained with the structure of the building), and (f) multi-resolution (meaning that simulations and observations cover days to months of data and may be considered at different granularities of space, time, and parameters). Moreover, generating an appropriate ensemble of simulations for decision making often requires multiple simulations, each with different parameters settings corresponding to slightly different, but plausible, scenarios. Therefore, significant savings in modeling and analysis can be obtained through data management software supporting modular re-use of existing simulation results in new settings, such as re-contextualization and modular recomposition (or ""sketching"") of building models and if-then analysis of simulation traces under new parameters, new building floorplans, and new contexts.  In developing the energy simulation data management system (e-SDMS), the research addresses the key data challenges that render data-driven energy simulations, today, difficult. This requires (a) a novel building models, simulation traces, and sensor/actuation traces (BSS) data model to accommodate energy simulation data and models, (b) feature analysis and indexing of sensory data and simulation traces along with the corresponding building models, and (c) algorithms for analysis and exploration of simulation traces and re-contextualization of models for new building plans and contextual metadata. This research will therefore, impact computational challenges that arise from the need to model, analyze, index, visualize, search, and recompose, in a scalable manner, large volumes of multi-variate series resulting from energy observations and simulations.  E-SDMS consists of an (a) eViz server, which works as a frontend to e-SDMS, an (b) eDMS middleware for feature extraction, indexing, simulation analysis, and sketching, and an (c) eStore backend for data storage.  To avoid waste and achieve scalabilities needed for managing large data sets, e-SDMS employs novel multi-resolution data partitioning and resource allocation strategies. The multi-resolution data encoding, partitioning, and analysis algorithms are efficiently computable, leverage massive parallelism, and result in high quality, compact data descriptions.","Silvestro Roberto Poccia, Maria Luisa Sapino, Sicong Liu, Xilun Chen, Yash Garg, Shengyu Huang, Jung Hyun Kim,

IDC Energy Insights as well as Architecture 2030, an environmental advocacy group, estimate that the smart buildings market (driven by componentization, standardization, smart equipment, subsystem integration, and smart grid) will reach $10B, with 50% of this market being in North America. Yet, IDC Energy Insights, a global provider of market intelligence for the energy technology sector, reported that 64% of the respondents to Smart Buildings Investment Survey stated that the cost of smart building technology is the #1 hurdle to investment and 44% of respondents highlighted that information gaps limit their capacity to invest. Due to the scale of data needed to be collected, integrated, and processed to fill this information gap data technologies are at a unique position to have transformative impact in this critical application domain.Yet, according to IDC Energy Insights, building automation systems are not designed to accommodate high data volumes and existing technologies are not good at managing heterogeneous data. The energy simulation data management system (e-SDMS) software we have developed fills an important hole in data-driven building design and clean energy (an area of national priority) and will enable applications and services with significant economic and environmental impact. Our research has impacted computational challenges that arise from the need to model, analyze, index, visualize, search, and recompose, in a scalable manner, large volumes of multi-variate series resulting from energy observations and simulations. The sustainable E-SDMS software infrastructure consisted of an (a) eViz server, which works as a frontend to e-SDMS, an (b) eDMS middleware for feature extraction, indexing, simulation analysis, and sketching, and an (c) eStore backend for data storage. An important challenge in executing large scale simulation ensembles is that the parameter space is very large and, therefore, given a fixed budget of simulations one can run, it is difficult to decide which simulations to run. We therefore developed techniques to schedule specific simulations in a multi-phase fashion. We developed incremental techniques that consider how the real-world observations evolve to decide which simulations to run based on what is happening in the real-world. Several courses and a new ""Big Data Systems concentratation""  have used multivariate time series coding, feature extraction, retrieval, and analysis tasks as projects. We have deployed the ensemble simulation engine underlying eSDMS within a disaster planning and coupled-simulation based decision support platform, DataStorm. NSF funded DataStorm aims to develop a novel computational infrastructure capable of executing multiple coupled simulations synergistically, under a unified probabilistic model. We have also transferred the research outcomes to the newly funded ""NSF PFI-RP: Data-Driven Services for High Performance and Sustainable Buildings"" project, which, in partnership with KGS, Siemens, and JCI, develops a novel Building Doctor's Medicine Cabinet (BDMC) service platform, empowered by novel multi-resolution (temporal and spatial) data analytics, high-dimensional robust modeling, and human-centered design. We have published the outcomes of the research in international conferences and journals (both in computer science and computational sustainability) and given several talks on ""Scalable Retrieval and Analysis of Multi-variate Temporal Data Sets"" and ""Real-Time Decision Making and Hypothesis Testing Through Large Scale Simulations"" in computer science and smart-energy venues. The project  involved 3 high-school, 4 undergraduate, 4MS, and 6 PhD students, and 1 research engineer. These students have been trained in research, critical thinking, team collaboration, system development, evaluation and experimentation, as well as technical writing and presentation skills. Several of these students had the opportunity to presented their works in international conferences. One of the MS students has received the ""Outstanding Graduating Master Student Award in Computer Science"" in Spring 2014. One of the high-school student received 2nd place in the Mathematics section of the 2014 Arizona Science &amp; Engineering Fair and presented a poster at the 2014 meeting of the American Statistical Association (ASA)-Arizona chapter meeting. 1 female MS student continued to PhD after graduation.

The goal of this project is to explore solutions for the challenges of designing wearable camera-based wayfinding assistants for blind persons from fundamental research to produce a portable proof-of-concept prototype to help blind users recognize targeted destinations from complex environments. The project accomplishes this goal by 1) developing robust motion deblurring methods to handle the irregular motions of blind users who are wearing the camera and 2) recognizing targeted destinations based on the requests of blind users for wayfinding and navigation. The proof-of-concept prototype system will be developed with visual information captured via a wearable camera on sunglasses/hat and a portable computer (mini laptop or cell phone) for data analysis, while the speech/sound outputs will be provided to a blind user via a Bluetooth earpiece. The performance of the newly developed algorithms and the proof-of-concept prototype will be evaluated by blind subjects.
The partnership engages different areas of expertise including university research, industry real system design and development, and blind user study from organizations for the blind and visually handicapped to provide solutions for the most challenging problems (motion blur and query-based targeted destination recognition) in the design of wearable camera-based wayfinding and navigation aids for blind users. The interdisciplinary areas of expertise pertain to the potential to translate the computer vision based assistive technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. This will lead to new revolutionary design concepts of cost-effective and portable camera-based assistive devices to help visually impaired people in achieving functional mobility comparable to people with normal vision. The potential economic impact is expected to be $120 million in the next 10 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in developing technology for blind wayfinding and navigation.

The translated LHR/LTC technology has the following unique feature: low heat rejection from a low temperature combustion engine that results in more favorable thermodynamics compared to either conventional or ordinary low temperature combustion engines. This provides exemplary efficiency, engine-out exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides and fixed carbon, and suitable exhaust temperatures for favorable operation of exhaust emission control systems when compared to the leading competing internal combustion engine. The project accomplishes its objectives by performing a proof-of-concept that experimentally and computationally realizes LHR concepts with LTC in a compression ignition engine resulting in a prototype LHR/LTC combustion mode operating in a light-duty automotive diesel engine.

GM provides guidance in the global automotive market space such as operating constraints, cost limitations, and technology integration with a marketable product in order to translate LHR/LTC combustion along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.

The societal impact, long term, will be improved vehicle fuel economy with reduced emission of criteria pollutants (e.g., nitrogen oxides), thereby reducing vehicle carbon footprint. Additionally, this effort will augment the investigators? efforts to increase female and underrepresented students in STEM disciplines and improve undergraduate student course instruction in thermodynamics by leveraging resources used for summer STEM camps and course redesign activities.

LHR is meant to reduce heat transfer and increase work transfer; previous conventional applications of LHR, however, resulted in unfavorable thermodynamics with much of the retained thermal energy increasing the exhaust enthalpy rather than increasing work transfer. LTC is meant to lower overall combustion temperatures to decrease certain emissions formation (i.e., NO and soot precursors) and also render favorable thermodynamics for improved efficiency (i.e., lower mixture temperatures and lower heat transfer). One significant drawback of LTC is extremely low exhaust temperatures (on the order of 125-250&deg;C) which are often below the necessary ""light-off"" temperatures of typical diesel aftertreatment systems. For example, a diesel oxidation catalyst requires a minimum 200&deg;C to oxidize CO. A diesel particulate filter requires both NO2 and a minimum 200&deg;C to be active. Urea in a selective catalytic reducer operating at temperatures below 200&deg;C forms deposits of ammonium nitrate solids in the system. Computational analysis showed that LTC coupled with LHR largely could mitigate the deterioration of unfavorable thermodynamics observed with conventional combustion, rendering improved engine efficiency while also increasing exhaust temperatures. The higher exhaust temperatures would enable aftertreatment to be operable throughout the operating regime. A proof-of-concept as well as an LTC / LHR engine prototype has been demonstrated and developed in this project.

A well-qualified project team with expertise in experimental and computational combustion engine research and development worked to develop LHR with LTC to increase both engine efficiency and exhaust temperatures, the latter which enables increased exhaust enthalpy into the aftertreatment system. The research leveraged existing NSF-funded combustion research and translated the technology to a potential market-valued solution that could enable the deployment of LHR concepts with LTC, creating improved energy conversion efficiency and lower emissions of internal combustion engines. The study centered on the hypothesis that LHR when coupled with LTC renders much higher efficiencies than ordinary implementation of LTC and further enables improved aftertreatment conversion of all regulated emissions.

The objectives of the development were to 1) Perform a proof-of-concept that experimentally and computationally realizes LHR concepts with LTC in a compression ignition engine in an effort to improve engine efficiency and power density, 2) Create a prototype LHR/LTC combustion mode that functionally demonstrates the proof-of-concept in a light-duty automotive diesel engine engineered and manufactured by the industrial sponsor (General Motors), and 3) Generate various ""optimal"" configurations of advanced combustion engine technology employing LTC with LHR concepts and aftertreatment systems to provide minimum fuel consumption solutions while meeting current federal emission targets.

The specific outcomes of these objectives include:

Developed a working prototype of LTC / LHR combustion mode and experimentally demonstrated in an engine.
Constructed and operated a computational model in GTPower to simulate the LTC / LHR engine prototype that was experimentally developed and parameterize various configurations to identify optimal solutions.

The Gear Bearing Drive or GBD is a compact mechanism with two key abilities. It operates as an actuator providing torque and as a joint providing support. This is possible be-cause of the novel combination of external rotor (outrunner type) DC motor technology and Gear Bearing technology. The GBD is a bearingless powered joint with large power density. It utilizes a unique two stage planetary gear arrangement that allows a high reduction ratio while maintain-ing a compact form factor. The project accomplishes its goals by completing three specific ob-jectives: A) To fully analyze, characterize and experimentally test existing preliminary proof of concept prototypes of GBD; B) To develop and fully characterize experimentally advanced pro-totypes of GBD optimized using design for manufacturing approaches; C) To integrate a series elastic and torque sensing element with the GBD to facilitate human-machine interaction in GBD powered systems.
In this project Northeastern University will be partnering with the start-up company Foodinie to investigate commercialization of the GBD. Foodinie, located in New York City, aims at de-veloping and commercializing novel robotic systems for assistance of the elderly at home. Food-inie is interested in developing both a novel robotic system actuated by the GBD and GBD actu-ated joint modules that could be sold as standalone components to other manufacturers. The PI and Northeastern University have recently been issued US patent 8,016,893 (Sep. 13, 2011) for this invention.
The intellectual merit of the proposed project is the design, advanced prototyping and thor-ough testing of an innovative compact, advanced actuator assembly that could find immediate commercial application in important markets such as rehabilitation, medicine, aerospace and others. The GBD will considerably improve the torque density and mechanical efficiency of ac-tuated robotic joints, and enhance the portability and effectiveness of robotic systems engaged in biomechanical applications such as rehabilitation robots and wearable exoskeletons.
 The current market size for robotic devices is 12 billion dollar with an expected expansion to 25 billion over the next 5 years. This market includes established manufacturing, defense and aerospace industries and emerging medical/health markets in prosthetics, bionics, and rehabilita-tion robotics. The GBD has potential to permeate all of these markets to varying degrees. These market opportunities seem large and with the validation attained from this investigation, we ex-pect to be able to attract and secure venture capital support for commercialization of the GBD.
The specific educational, broader impact and outreach activities of this project are: 1) The in-itiation of undergraduate students (including students from under-represented groups) in research in robotics; 2) The establishment of collaborative projects in advanced actuators and robotics with the science and technology high schools of Massachusetts with the objective to attract new students in this field; 3) The organization of a one semester I-cubator (student) project on market analysis and business planning for the proposed GBD technologies; 4) The establishment of a seminar series and of a webpage in the area of advanced actuators for robotic systems; and 5) The performance of graduate and undergraduate student internships in industry.","Brassitos, E. and Jalili, N~Compact Joint-Drive System for Space Robots~ASME Journal of Mechanical Design~~2017~~~~0~ ~0~ ~19/09/2017 13:35:32.233000000, Brassitos, E., Constantinos, M., Weinberg, B.,~The Gear Bearing Drive: A Novel Compact Actuator for Robotic Joints~Proceedings of the 2013 ASME Mechanisms and Robotics Conference, Proceedings of the ASME 2013 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and  Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE 2013).~~2013~~~~0~ ~0~ ~12/02/2016 17:00:41.360000000, Brassitos, E., Kong, A., Constantinos, M., Weinberg, B.~Design Improvements and Design Methodology for the Gear Bearing Drive: A Compact, Powerful and Cost-Effective Robotic Actuator~Proceedings of the 2014 ASME Mechanisms and Robotics Conference, Proceedings of the ASME 2014 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE 2013)~~2014~~~~0~ ~0~ ~12/02/2016 17:00:41.383000000, Cho, K., Candelino, N., and Jalili, N~Application of Robust-Adaptive Sliding Mode Control to the Speed Regulation of a Brushless AC Actuator System~Dynamic Systems and Control Conference, ASME, October 11-13, 2017, Tysons, Virginia, USA~~2017~~~~0~ ~0~ ~19/09/2017 13:35:32.253000000",,"The joints of a robot play an important role in its overall size, weight, performance and cost. They influence its dynamics and payload capacity just as they affect its manipulation dexterity and range of motion. To date, robots have been very successful in industrial factories under tethered conditions, yet are falling behind in mobile applications where size, weight, efficiency and compactness are often decisive to the product success. Accordingly, hardware advancements in actuator and drive system technology could improve general robotic capabilities, principally mobile systems, allowing the technology to permeate new markets and give birth to new products that are unattainable with current commercial actuators. The same need for these actuators, at the level of their gearmotor, is found in general consumer products such as hand-held powered tools, toys and household equipment that are often desired to be as small and lightweight as possible.

In this project, the motor and gearbox and joint interfaces are multiplexed using dual-function mechanical components to reduce the number of parts and size of the assembly. The concept employs ground symmetry to balance the internal loads of the mechanism and to rigidly secure its output member. Furthermore, the motor is integrated within a unique transmission with the ability to produce any gear ratio (from 1:1 to more than 1:5000) using a low and fixed set of parts. Then, a parametric analysis is conducted over a range of values for each transmission component taking into account the applicable motor size, resultant transmission ratio and output torque causing failure. These results, in combination with a clear understanding of the design through finite element analysis, were used to develop one prototype of the joint. Due to its integral design approach, the actuator combines the motor and transmission and joint structure and a sensing element into a space that is volumetrically smaller than a human elbow joint. This method leads to ultra-compact actuators with incredible high torque output, strong and rugged structural integrity. A dynamometer testbed has been developed to characterize the joint and evaluate its performance such as torque and speed relationships, stiffness and backlash, temperature rise, noise, and system bandwidth.

Compared to conventional precision drive systems such as harmonic drives, the gear bearing drive offer similar advantages such as high-torque in a compact assembly but with the potential of better stiffness characteristics and lower transmission friction and more predictable output speed response.  In this year?s report, we experimentally characterize the open-loop behavior of one gear bearing drive prototype by studying its kinematic error, stiffness and friction characteristics. We also develop a simple but accurate dynamic model that capture its velocity dynamics.  We further develop an analytical stiffness model for the transmission using the bending flexure of gear-teeth and transmission geometry. Finally, we present a sensitivity study that recreates the response of this transmission under various input and output loads.

Building from the results of previous reports, a new open-loop system has been developed during last year (when the new supplement award was granted) that combines the metal prototype gear-bearing transmission with a high efficiency brushless-AC motor and precision sensors for measuring both rotational motion and torque.  While the previously reported open-loop characterization is primarily useful for fundamental research into the efficiency and optimization of the gear-bearing transmission system, a simpler model has been developed for the purposes of testing closed-loop control strategies.  This simplified 1 degree-of-freedom model neglects kinematic error and accounts for the only the most dominant non-idealities. Based on this model, two feedback control strategies have been developed and tested. Finally, real-time closed-loop control experiments were performed using both control paradigms. These final results demonstrate the potential of this unique gear-bearing mechanism as a transmission element in compact, speed control or position system drive-trains.

The system is designed to be used by a field nurse and addresses a number of challenges with low resource setting diagnosis of Kaposi?s sarcoma including: the ability to take and process a biopsy sample in the field, providing at least a 10-fold increase in the number of diagnostic reactions that can be performed on a single battery charge by using sunlight to drive the thermal cycling process, and elimination of the reliance on specialized instrumentation enabling the system to be fixed in the field by the operator.   The project accomplishes its objectives by constructing a complete prototype resulting in pre-clinical optimization which is a critical evaluation stage prior to clinical implementation.  The partnership engages experts in limited resource setting diagnostics to provide guidance in the field requirements as they pertain to the potential to translate the KS-Detect system along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.

The societal impact, long term, will be better diagnostics of Kaposi?s sarcoma. Kaposi's sarcoma is the leading cancer in men and the second leading cancer in women in sub-Saharan Africa.  KS is difficult to distinguish from other angioproliferative diseases, particularly in Africa where access to trained pathologists is limited to few hospitals and immunohistochemistry is practically non-existent.  Multiple studies have shown that PCR based nucleic acid identification of Kaposi?s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) in skin biopsies represents the best method of performing an unambiguous diagnosis in the absence of immunohistochemistry.  In addition to the research activities proposed here, we will develop a series of social media tools to facilitate world-wide sharing of recent scientific and technological advances in limited resource setting diagnostics.  Services like Facebook and Twitter are now the dominant method by which information is disseminated across the world, but their adoption by the scientific community has been painfully slow.  Here we will use these tools to establish a virtual community of doctors, scientists, engineers, technologists, and field workers interested in limited resource setting diagnostics.  New technologies, news articles, results of clinical studies, and other information of interest will be disseminated through these tools to this community.",,,,CORNELL UNIVERSITY

Our team also received a Icorps grant, where we learnt how to develop a business canvas model.  The broader impact is that success in this endeavor is anticipated to spur the growth of analogous strategies to identify other infectious agents and human disorders using simple devices. Since glycans are excellent recognition molecules that bind to a number of infectious agents, Ultimately, we envision that patients suffering from infections and other chronic ailments will be able to monitor themselves several times in a day in the privacy of their homes using inexpensive, user-friendly devices.  Results can be electronically transmitted to physicians, which is expected to reduce hospital visits and improve personalized medicine.

A gliding robotic fish is an underwater robot that represents a hybrid of underwater glider and robotic fish. With buoyancy-driven gliding and spiraling, the robot achieves energy-efficient locomotion; on the other hand, it can swim like a fish with an active tail and achieve high maneuverability. Consequently, a gliding robotic fish can serve as an inexpensive, mobile sensor platform for sensing in various aquatic environments, such as inland lakes, rivers, and coastal waters.

This project has resulted in a new gliding robotic fish prototype, called GRACE 2.0. ""GRACE"" stands for Gliding-Robot-ACE, and it was the name of the first gliding robotic fish prototype. The new prototype features a mechanical design that allows the robot shell to be opened easily, which facilitates diagnosis and service of the robot. The robot also has a modular architecture for its sensors, so that it can be readily customized for applications of interest. The robot has been successfully tested in a large indoor tank and in a swimming pool. For case studies, the robot is equipped with five environmental sensors for monitoring harmful algal blooms and associated biological and physical variables. It is also mounted with an acoustic receiver capable of detecting signals emitted by acoustic tags implanted in live fish, and thus allows it to monitor the movement patterns of live fish. The project has also contributed to the knowledge base in the design, modeling, and control of gliding robotic fish and robotic fish in general.  

The project has contributed to a US patent application and multiple publications in archival journals and conference proceedings.  Commercialization efforts are underway to take the gliding robotic fish technology to the marketplace, through either a startup company or licensing. Ultimately, the technology can benefit various applications, such as drinking water safety, port and maritime security, underwater infrastructure inspection, and ecological system monitoring. The project has provided opportunities for the training of a number of graduate students, undergrad students, and K-12 teachers. Finally, it has contributed to various activities for outreaching to K-12 students and the general public, including, in particular, a seven-month exhibit ""Robotic Fish Rendezvous"" at the Michigan State University Museum.

The translated recycling technology demonstrates lower cost and higher efficiency when compared to existing hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical recycling techniques in this market space. The project accomplishes its objectives by recovering cathode materials from spent Li-ion batteries and producing new cathode materials regardless of the Li-ion battery cathode chemistry. In addition, the project will recover copper current collectors using a sensor-based sorting technology that, combined with the proposed hydrometallurgical recovery process, will result in a closed-loop industrial recycling process for Li-ion batteries with varying chemistries. The partnership engages wTe Corporation to provide guidance in sensing technologies to extract copper-bearing materials.  wTe will also assist with addressing marketing, financing, and commercialization issues in order to translate the proposed Li-ion battery recycling process to a competitive commercial reality. 

With increasing consumer demand for hybrid cars, electrical cars, portable electronics, and grid systems, the usage of Li-ion batteries is increasing and is only projected to rise in the future. Since the largest Li reserves exist in politically unstable or uncooperative countries, demand for these critical resources are a matter of national strategic importance. Additionally, from an environmental perspective, the electrolyte in Li-ion batteries is flammable. If Li-ion batteries are burned, toxic HF could be released into the environment. Existing recycling techiques aimed at Li-ion batteries are either cost-prohibitive or unable to accommodate the ever-changing Li-ion battery chemistries.

Over two decades later, they remain widely used and account for about 60% of worldwide sales of portable batteries. Li-ion batteries have become popular due to their high energy density, flexible and lightweight design, and long lifespan in comparison to competing battery technologies. Current Li-ion battery production numbers in the billions of units per year. This made for an $11.8 billion industry in 2011, and is expected to increase to $50 billion by 2020. One reason for this dramatic increase in Li-ion battery production is the increased use for hybrid and electric vehicles. However, Li-ion batteries are not widely recycled because current technologies can not recycle them efficiently. 

In this award, Worcester Polytechnic Institute developed a novel recycling process combining the material recycling and new material synthesis, which enables the transformation of laboratory research to industrial commercialization of Li-ion battery recycling. The recycling technology can recycle Li-ion batteries with any size, shape and chemistry. LiNixMnyCozO2 (NMC) with different ratio of x, y and z is synthesized. Experimental scale has gone up from 20g to 1kg. The recovered NMC has been evaluated at both WPI and Argonne National Laboratory and shows similar properties with commercial virgin materials. In addition to the cathode materials, other materials including copper, aluminium, steel and graphite are also recycled.

Currently, in the US the vast majority of Li-ion batteries are landfilled. Li-ion batteries are not recycled because currently there is not an economical process to recycle small Li-ion batteries used in cell phones and laptops. However, this waste has economic, health/safety, and national security implications. It is believed that such an open loop industrial cycle is not sustainable and that the U.S. must establish viable Li-ion battery recycling methodologies. The developed technology at WPI allows synthesizing new cathode materials directly without separating Co, Ni and Mn. Economic analysis shows that a profit with more than $1,500 can be obtained when recycling one tone of Li-ion batteries. A start-up (Battery Resourcers LLC) was founded to commercialize the recycling technology, which are being supported by NSF STTR phase I. Furthermore, both undergraduate and graduate student have been trained on entrepreneur and commercialization while doing the research through taking business courses and industrial immersion.

AR is the superimposition of computer-generated images over a user-view of the real world. Emulated Graphical Monitoring is the concurrent 3D visualization of an engineering process ongoing in the real environment. The translated technology has the following unique features: it can allow excavator operators to persistently see what utilities are buried in a digging machine?s vicinity, thus helping prevent utility strike accidents; it can also allow the monitoring of a working excavator?s proximity to buried assets, thereby enabling real-time knowledge-based excavator control. These features provide exemplary situational awareness, safety, and confidence to excavator operators when compared to the leading competing machine control technologies in this market space that are limited to providing grade control guidance during excavation. The project accomplishes is goals by pursuing an accelerated plan to develop and evaluate a field-deployable prototype of the technology for customer demonstration and evaluation along the path to commercial reality, resulting in a market-ready capability that can allow an excavator operator to be visually aware of buried underground utilities and other assets in the vicinity of a machine, and can offer quantitative feedback of machine distance to vicinal obstructions.

An excavator unintentionally hits a buried utility every 60 seconds in the U.S. causing fatalities, injuries, and property damage that annually cost billions of dollars.

The potential economic impact of this project is expected to be the transformation of excavator operation from a skill-based activity to a knowledge-based practice, leading to improvements in productivity and safety within the next three years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the burgeoning civil infrastructure construction and rehabilitation industry. Such benefits will also accrue in manufacturing, transportation, mining, and ship-building where transition from skill-based to knowledge-based processes is seen to be of value. The societal impact, long term, will be the reductions in construction and underground infrastructure life-cycle costs that will be possible through safe and efficient excavation.","Kurt M.

The ability to automatically estimate this pose is a crucial component of technical innovations aimed at improving both safety and productivity in many construction tasks. A computer vision based solution using a network of cameras and markers was developed in this research to enable such a capability for articulated machines.

Firstly, a planar marker is magnetically mounted on the end-effector of interest. Another marker is fixed on the jobsite whose 3D pose is pre-surveyed in a project coordinate frame. Then a cluster of at least two cameras respectively observing and tracking the two markers simultaneously forms a camera-marker network and transfers the end-effector's pose into the desired project frame, based on a pre-calibration of the relative poses between each pair of cameras.

Through extensive sets of uncertainty analyses and field experiments, this approach is shown to be able to achieve centimeter level depth tracking accuracy within 10 meters with only two ordinary cameras and a few markers, providing a flexible and cost-efficient alternative to other commercial products that use infrastructure dependent sensors like GPS. A working prototype has been tested on several active construction sites with positive feedback from excavator operators confirming the solution's effectiveness.

A vision-based sensor system, comprised of fiducial markers and optical cameras, offers a potential low cost and ubiquitous alternative. However, because markers cannot be placed directly on an excavator?s bucket for occlusion and durability reasons, a device is needed to transmit bucket motion and provide information necessary to deduce tooth pose.

Several design iterations were developed to address this problem, including a four-bar linkage design, a synchronous belt design, a bucket linkage generalized mapping design, and a cable potentiometer generalized mapping design. Prototypes were fabricated, installed, and tested. Promising experimental results suggest the feasibility of vision-based sensor technology for excavator pose estimation. Marker-based sensors were found to offer a potential solution for the economical localization and pose estimation of articulated construction equipment, especially in environments with limited GPS capabilities.

Advances in lithography that have allowed the printing of progressively smaller features have enabled the revolution in the information technology industry for the past ~50 years. Industry plans to soon start using extreme ultraviolet light, EUV, to print the next generations of integrated circuits with smaller device feature sizes (EUV is light with wavelength shorter that ultraviolet, within which the particular wavelength of choice at 13.5 nm). The goal of this project was to look beyond EUV lithography, to help accelerate the development of beyond extreme ultraviolet lithography (BEUV) technology at a wavelength in the vicinity of 6.7 nm, and to educate students trained to be innovators.  The effort combined the expertise of researchers from the now graduated NSF Engineering Research Center for EUV Science and Technology, and Cymer.  The development of a plasma-based incoherent light source at this wavelength was addressed by modeling and experiments using laser-created plasmas. The development of compact coherent light sources to support nano-metrology at BEUV wavelengths in support of lithography was also investigated. We conducted a comprehensive study of the emission from Gd and Tb laser produced plasmas as a source in the 6.5-6.8 nm wavelength region of interest for BEUV lithography.  Experiments were conduced over a broad range of laser irradiation parameters using a single l = 1030 nm laser.  BEUV emission spectra were measured as a function of laser pulse duration emission angle, and spatial location within the plasma.  Images of the BEUV emitting plasma region were obtained as a function of irradiation parameters. The Gd plasma emission driven by nanosecond laser pulses was found to best match the reflectivity bandwidth of our multilayer mirrors centered near &lambda; = 6.74 nm, contributing to maximize the conversion efficiency into BEUV light . The peak of the emission spectrum was observed to broaden and to shift to longer wavelength as the duration of the driver laser pulses was shortened from nanoseconds to hundreds of picoseconds. Simulations show that the picosecond irradiation creates significantly hotter plasmas in which the dominant emission originates from more highly ionized species. Spatially resolved spectra of the Gd plasmas show the maximum emission originates at 50 mm from the target surface. The conversion efficiency into BEUV light was determined by integrating angularly resolved measurements obtained using an array of calibrated energy monitors. Similar maximum conversion efficiency of about 0.47% was measured for both the Gd and Tb plasmas. The size of the BEUV emitting region was measured to approximately match the spot size of the laser on target, in agreement with simulations.

Intellectual merit: The AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the science of buckled stiff thin films on soft substrates as strain sensors to fill the technology gap in the strain measurement area to simultaneously realize both high spatial resolution and high sensitivity strain mapping.

This project has studied (1) optimization of grating with reduced imperfections, (2) reduce the laser beam size to increase the sensitivity and spatial resolution, and (3) realization of automation. The project also produced a functional prototype for next-stage commercialization. Because this strain sensor and its scanning mechanism are different from the existing strain mapping techniques, such as DIC/micro-Moir&eacute; techniques, and SEM DIC, this technology fills a technology gap that requires high spatial resolution with simultaneous large field-of-view.

The specific engineering study of reducing defects in grating will also impact the general area of buckling, which can be used for stretchable interconnects. This project is potentially transformative as it is anticipated to result in engineering contribution to the development of an innovative strain sensor as a new member in the family of strain measurement, which routinely impacts many different fields, ranging from structures, electronics, and health. The research will integrate education, including undergraduate and graduate students education and course development.

SIS may also be considered as an alternative to conventional powder metallurgy (P/M) by removing expensive molds. The proposed process is anticipated to present an order of magnitude reduction in machine cost and an order of magnitude improvement in building speed as compared with other competing AM processes.

Intellectual Merits: The most distinctive feature of the SIS process is the inhibition of sinteringin selected areas of powder layers. While the sintering process has been studied and appliedextensively before, the traditional research and practice in powder sintering has focused on enhancing and speeding the sintering process, and not on inhibiting it. In this research scientific exploration of the inhibition phenomenon using reliable measurement equipment and methods is pursued, and a set of statistically designed experiments have been conducted to advance this promising fabrication technology. The research has resulted in an in-depth understanding of the scientific principles underlying the SIS process. The activity has focused on identification of the key factors for process control and optimization for high temperature metals such as stainless steel. The research program has made the following fundamental contributions: a) understanding the micro mechanical sintering inhibition phenomenon and identifying means for increasing its effectiveness, b) understanding the relation between the inhibitor choices and metal/alloy choices, and c) understanding the interactions between the inhibition process and sintering conditions that produce advantageous and disadvantageous process pathways. Through this research procedures for significantly improving the physical properties and dimensional accuracy of parts produced by SIS have been realized.

Broader Impacts: The research has created a basis in engineering science for an inexpensive and rapid digital fabrication technique that is applicable to a wide variety of metallic powders. Practical uses of such a technique include fabrication of functional parts for the aerospace and automotive industries, and custom design parts for medical devices, primarily using hard-to-machine materials such as stainless steel, titanium and super alloys. The results are useful as well to the conventional powder metallurgy industry as expensive molding requirement can be removed in the SIS process. The funded activity has nurtured a researchpartnership between the affiliated industry and USC, and has provided educational opportunitiesfor for both graduate and undergraduate students. Outreach to under-represented students byactively recruiting minority graduate students as research assistants has been planned. Two of the doctoral students who worked on the project have started a new company whihc has received funding through NSF SBIR Phase I and &amp; II grants as well as through private investment. The stratup is now producing products and rendering service to manufacturing industry. A variation of the SIS technology, called Selective Separation Shaping, has been licensed to another company.

The successful demonstration of OPV devices on flexible nanowire/PET substrates is a solid step forward towards the full roll-to-roll printing of such technologies. The prototype devices, including the integration of organic solar cells with supercapacitor and control circuit, are significant demonstration of the potential of simultaneously harvesting and storing the solar energy, which is the key objective of this award.

2. Education and training: This project has been an excellent opportunity to train graduate students and undergraduate students as it involves experts from a variety of research fields in distinctively different disciplines (chemistry and engineering). Working within this team has helped students to develop research and communication skills and understand challenges involved in other fields and also how to work with researchers from different fields to achieve specific goals. Female and minority students have been trained with this award.

3. Publication and presentation: Results obtained in this work have been published in peer reviewed journals (34 publications as of now), and the participants (students and faculty members) have given research presentations in various venues, including materials-focused and device-focused conferences.

4. Outreach to general public, and K-12: Outreach has been a major focus of the award. A summary of outreach efforts is as follows. Each year, two students from a local high school (North Carolina School of Science and Math, Durham, NC) are hosted in the PI/Co-PI?s labs. The group participated in the UNC Science Expo and Climate LEAP program at UNC each year and the Fitzpatrick Institute of Photonics Symposium at Duke. The expo and symposium have an emphasis on outreach to historically underrepresented groups and include Title I schools. 2-3 undergraduates were involved at all times in project activities, including two who were co-authors on a journal publication.

We attempted several strategies to expand the commercial viability of our discovery of high thermal conductivity in chain-oriented amorphous polymer, which is an attractive material because of its combination of excellent mechanical compliance and high thermal conductivity. We focused on two important applications: thermal management of electronic devices and thermally conductive polymer substrate for electronic device integration. We used cathodic polarization with the pore widening process to accomplish the removal of barrier layer and interacted with Synkera Technologies Inc. towards the development of polymer filled aluminum nanotemplates. The complete removal of the barrier layer occurred with cathodic polarization at applied potential of -3.2 V for 15 min and pore widening of 80 min. It is possible to control the pore diameter without damaging the structural integrity of templates. However, the templates fabricated through this process have suffer from poor adhesion to the substrate, which makes the processing approach unreliable. As a result of this finding, we made a pivot to a different approach to realize a useful thermal management product from our materials. In this approach, we focused on making films of the polymer using freestanding templates. We demonstrated that films with consistent thermal conductivity could be made with this approach.

The translated technology has the following unique features: rapid identification of new target compounds with high activity for reducing shrinkage and associated cracking of concrete that provides exemplary cost savings in the development stage as well as the ability to identify new and non-intuitive molecular structures for a given application with improved performance when compared to the leading competing technology in this market space.  The project accomplishes this goal by applying computer aided molecular design (CAMD) technology resulting in the identification of new compounds with improved characteristics for use as shrinkage reducing admixtures in concrete; the efficacy of which will be demonstrated on a prototype-scale concrete slab.  The partnership engages Tennessee Technological University (TTU), the University of Akron (UA) and technology consultant Mr. Hugh Cameron to provide guidance in the concrete construction materials industry and other aspects related to market development, licensing, business planning and financing as they pertain to the potential to translate the new technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.  The potential economic impact is expected to be a reasonable market share of the existing shrinkage reducing admixture sales in the next five years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the concrete admixture market space.   The societal impact, long term, will be to improve the performance of concrete infrastructure and thereby save potentially billions of future dollars in lost time and energy consumption due to avoided early and premature repair and maintenance.",,,"It is no secret that our concrete infrastructure needs repair and that new concrete yet to be placed must be sustainable and perform better than the materials that preceded it.  One problem that has eluded the modern concrete industry is the problem of cracking.  Cracks form in concrete for many reasons, among these is shrinkage.  While it is hard to believe that concrete shrinks, in fact, it shrinks as it hardens due to processes called ""autogenous mechanisms,"" and it shrinks later due to drying.  Both of these processes are at least in-part related to the fact that water has a very high surface tension.  Have you ever seen an insect walking on water?  To an insect, the water?s surface is something like a trampoline is to us.  The tension in the trampoline?s surface supports even heavy objects.  Surprisingly, the tension in the surface of water is so great that when distributed over a large area, such as the surface within the porosity of concrete, it can actually produce enough force to pull-in on the concrete and make it shrink.  Researchers at Tennessee Technological University (TTU) and the University of Akron (UA) have shown that they can identify specially designed molecules that will reduce the surface tension of water and produce less shrinkage in concrete.  What is unique about this work is that it is utilizing, for the first time, a process called Computer Aided Molecular Design (CAMD).  CAMD uses information about how known substances behave, encodes their molecular structure and relates it to their performance and then uses that information to predict new molecules with expected improved performance.  This technique greatly reduces the search possibilities and provides a focused way to quickly and cost effectively advance technology to improve many applications such as how concrete performs.  What does this mean for the average person?  Congested roads alone cost Americans $101 billion annually in wasted time and fuel.  Such costs can be reduced by avoiding repairs through the use of advanced technologies that extend the life of concrete materials used for paving and highway structures.

 

As a result of our work, our team has successfully identified a new family of shrinkage reducing substances and is presently pursuing intellectual property (IP) protection and the formation of a small business to market our materials.  We are seeking partners and early adopters on an on-going basis to establish an entry-point into the competitive business of concrete admixtures.  Our new compounds have two unique properties.  First and foremost, the new compounds reduce shrinkage.  In addition, our new compounds tend to retain strength and in some cases even improve strength of concrete within the first few day.  This time period is critical since construction crews typically seek high early strengths so that other work can continue as quickly as possible after placing the concrete.

 

In addition to our new family of compounds, the faculty team has mentored a group of six engineering students in the science of admixture design and art of business development.  These students, two of which have now graduated and taken jobs in industry, have been well-served by this grant investment and are uniquely prepared to translate inventions into innovation using entrepreneurship skills learned as part of this project.

The translated plant-based biomanufacturing platform has the following unique features: harvested leaves from wild-type, nontransgenic Nicotiana benthamiana (a relative of tobacco) are used as production hosts, transient expression of the recombinant therapeutic protein takes place in a contained system, a novel Cucumber mosaic virus expression system is used to increase expression level, and glycosylation of the recombinant protein is modified in a post-production, in-vitro process providing an exemplary highly scalable approach that significantly reduces capital investment and manufacturing costs, minimizes environmental impact and improves product quality in terms of safety and consistency when compared to the leading competing production technologies in this market space.  The project accomplishes this goal by developing a technoeconomic engineering-based model to quantify the  capital investment costs and total production costs for a plant-based biomanufacturing facility to produce a human orphan drug, alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), evaluating the market potential and patent landscape surrounding our technology, identifying the regulatory pathway and refining our finance and revenue model to bring plant-made AAT closer to the market and position us to pursue partnerships for clinical development.

The target product for demonstration of this platform is alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a human blood protein that is defective in patients with a genetic disorder known as AAT deficiency (AATD), requiring weekly infusions as replacement therapy. 

 In this project we developed a technoeconomic model for a novel biomanufacturing process that uses tobacco plants as the host for production of recombinant alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), utilizing process parameters and data obtained from laboratory experiments as well as information provided by industry collaborators. Experimental outcomes include the development of a downstream process for plant-recombinant AAT (prAAT), such as identification of an optimized extraction buffer, extraction methods and purification strategy for recovery of total and functional AAT.  Purified prAAT was characterized and showed the expected amino acid sequence and amino acid composition but showed less heterogeneity with regard to post-translational modifications compared with human plasma-derived AAT.  Site specific glycan analysis was also performed and as expected the prAAT showed nonsialylated complex glycoforms with plant-specific N glycans at the 3 N-linked glycosylation sites. The technoeconomic model indicates that there is a significant reduction in required capital costs for the plant-based biomanufacturing facility compared with published mammalian cell culture technoeconomic models and also a reduction in total operating costs.

In terms of broader impacts, the project trained undergraduates (including a woman engineering student), a graduate student and postdocs, in bioprocess engineering, technoeconomic analysis and technology translation aspects of plant-based production of therapeutic proteins.  Students not only learned the technical aspects surrounding the technology (laboratory techniques, data management) but also gained new knowledge about applying research to technology translation and innovation.  The project also identified market opportunities, patent landscape and regulatory considerations that facilitated the establishment of Inserogen, Inc., a plant biotech startup that is focused on the development and commercialization of orphan biologics.

Over 95% of preclinical drug research employs rodents as the first stage of validation. With only 1 in 10,000 drug candidates successfully attaining FDA approval, a more efficient and effective means of screening drug candidates in rodents is necessary. Accurate delivery and confirmation of delivered doses are urgently need, however, neither feature is available in any non-clinical or clinical implantable pump on the market. Instead, users are forced to select from primitive and suboptimal administration technologies involving injections, catheter tethers, or nonadjustable continuous infusion. With more drug formulations featuring peptide, biologics and other short half-life compounds, fine control of drug administration is increasingly important for achieving drug efficacy. To remove these barriers, we developed a fully functional and manufacturable prototype infusion micropump; developed wireless circuitry for dose tracking and achieved integrated with the micropump; and demonstrated wireless tracking of infusion of precise volumes from micropump into tissue models. A working prototype closed-loop implantable infusion system was demonstrated at the benchtop.

 

Fabrication of a manufacturable prototype micropump: 

The micropump reservoir packaging was redesigned with an inner diameter close to that of the bellows outer diameter, minimizing inaccessible dead volume from ~800 &mu;L to less than 100 &mu;L.
A custom-made passive normally closed spring-loaded ball check valve was included at the pump outlet to prevent backflow of fluids as a result of the reverse pressure gradient caused by recombination.


Integrated sensors and wireless circuitry for dose tracking: 

Tracking of doses delivered from the reservoir was achieved by electrochemical impedance measurements through the drug solution.
Wireless circuitry was designed in order to combine wireless powering and data telemetry to allow for programmability and infusion rate control as well as dose sensing. 
Once the final prototype was assembled, wireless programming and sensing were each separately calibrated, followed by demonstration of simultaneous flow control and sensing for an example delivery regimen with and without the new custom-made spring-loaded ball check valve.  Recombination detection using the dosing system, as well as, the effects of coil misalignment and distance on powering, programmability, and dose sensing data transfer were also investigated.


Wireless tracking of infusion of precise volumes from micropump into tissue models: 

Although long term in vivo studies were beyond the scope of the work proposed here, simulated brain simulated tissue material consisting of hydroxyethyl cellulose-based gels were used to successfully demonstrate wireless closed-loop operation.

Microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology has emerged as a potential clean technology for direct electricity generation from wastewater while accomplishing wastewater treatment simultaneously. However, to take this technology one step further to the market place, real wastewater from food and beverage industry need to be evaluated in a fully functioning prototype MFC capable of producing high current and voltage. To that end, in this project, we focused on the development of new cathode materials and the design and evaluation of novel MFC reactors.

This research results in the discovery of two cathode catalysts (one is activated carbon based and the other is graphene based) that are suitable for being used in microbial fuel cells. This research also demonstrates that porous polyethylene membrane has great potential as a supporting material and diffusion layer for cathode scaling up. This research also results in the fabrication of two types of MFC reactors, one is vertically aligned MFC assemblies and the other is horizontally aligned MFC reactors. While high power densities were achieved in these reactors, some issues, such as cathode leaking and reactor clogging were observed during the real wastewater testing. Strategies were identified and tested to overcome these issues including modifying the reactor design and operation conditions. These results not only help accelerate the scaling up and commercialization of MFCs through providing some key design and operational parameters, but also benefit the development microbial electrochemical systems for diverse other applications such as bioremediation and biosensing.

This project enhanced the development of our partnerships with potential investors. A local startup company has licensed the technology and is in the process of commercializing the technology. This project broadened the knowledge of the involved undergraduate and graduate students and enhanced their ability to innovate through their interactions with industry personnel and attendance to the professional conferences. This project also enhanced the public awareness of energy and environmental sustainability issues through our publications, presentations, and lab tours

Proper treatment of wastewater is critically important to human health and societal development. The existing methods for treating wastewater, especially those based on aerobic processes (e.g., activated sludge process), are energy and resource intensive. In theory, wastewater contains more energy (in organic compounds) than what is consumed by its treatment. Thus, recovering useful energy from wastewater will make its treatment more sustainable. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) as an emerging treatment concept have exhibited potential advantages in direct electricity generation and low energy consumption. In the past decade, numerous studies have advanced MFC technology from the aspects of microbiology, materials, configuration, operation, and electrochemistry. However, lacking large-scale systems and long-term operation with actual wastewater hinders its development. The objectives of this project are to establish a new platform based on a large-scale MFC system and understand its long-term performance of treating actual wastewater under a non-laboratory condition.

The core of the project is the construction of a 200-L MFC system and the deployment of this system in a local wastewater treatment plant. The MFC system consists of multiple MFC modules, thereby creating a condition for studying both hydraulic and electrical connection in a multi-module system. This MFC system has been operated for more than one year, and can effectively remove contaminants. It removes nearly 80% of chemical oxygen demand and about 90% of ammonium nitrogen. The optimal electrical connection is determined for both serial (within a group of modules) and parallel (between groups) connections. The produced electrical energy can offset about 20% of the energy consumption that is required for operating the MFC system. Although the MFC system does not reach energy neutral, its energy consumption is significantly lower than that of aerobic treatment. The long term operation of this system has not required much maintenance or resulted in any significant fouling of the membrane/cathode electrode that obviously decreases the system performance.

The research findings have greatly advanced the understanding of MFC technology in the aspects of system scaling up, module coordination, energy harvest and application, and long term performance with actual wastewater. Those findings have filled in the gap of knowledge for transforming MFC technology from bench scale to large scale towards pilot/ full scale development. The project has demonstrated the feasibility of MFC technology for treating domestic wastewater, though challenges still exist to optimize the system configuration and operation. It provides scientific evidences for supporting and helps accelerate the development of this technology for commercialization. The MFC development will continue beyond this project.

This project has provided opportunities of research for both undergraduate and graduate students. Six undergraduate students have participated in the project and gained the research experience. One Master student and one PhD student have completed their theses as a result of the project. The research findings have been disseminated through multiple approaches, including journal publications (three peer-reviewed journal papers), conference presentations, activities engaging with college freshmen from different disciplines, and interaction with wastewater industry.

With the increasing clinical acceptance of Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implants, there is an urgent need in the industry to develop low-temperature coating processes. The translated biomimetic coating technology has several distinctive features. First, being a low temperature benign process, it is eminently suitable for coating polymeric substrates such as PEEK implants. Second, the process has the ability to produce carbonated-calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA), similar in composition to bone mineral and a bioactive variation of inert hydroxyapatite. Third, unlike conventional biomimetic processes spanning over several weeks, the deposition of the coating takes place within a relatively short time frame of less than an hour, thus providing the ability for large scale industrial production. All of these features taken together make the technology more versatile than conventional coating processes. This project accomplishes the broad objective of fabricating the coatings and evaluating them for their physical, mechanical, and biomedical properties in vitro and in vivo; data essential to obtain approval from the various regulatory agencies, like the FDA. 

This effort is a ""Win-Win"" situation for both the partners:  The University of Toledo and Orchid Bio-coat (Orchid) will work with the University of Toledo's Technology Transfer Office to bring the technology to market. The partnership engages Orchid to provide guidance to UT in the overall manufacturing, translation, distribution and further commercialization aspects that will introduce to the market a new generation of bioactive orthopedic implants made out of PEEK.  Orchid is one of the nation's largest providers of plasma sprayed coatings on titanium implants with their distribution network all across the globe.  However, with the switch from metallic to polymeric implants, UT will be able to provide the ""turn-key"" technology. The potential economic impact is expected to be felt within next three years' time frame, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this orthopedic implant space.

This project has a significant societal impact on the ageing ""Baby Boomers"" and an increasingly active general population.  These segments of the society, which are growing at a very fast rate, experience the most musculoskeletal diseases and injuries. This population is expected to require a wide variety of implants.

This proposal will address this demand by developing improved and novel products with enhanced integration of the implant with the adjoining boney surfaces.  The effort will also train qualified manpower and will cater to the needs of implant manufacturers.","Huan Zhou, Vijay K. Goel, Sarit B.

CDHA is similar in composition to bone mineral and hence helps in bonding of the implant surface with bone. Magnesium phosphates are newer materials, as opposed to calcium phosphates and have additional capability. Hence is their choice.

Intrinsic merits 

Coating deposition with the assistance of microwaves is an important merit of the project. The initial motivation of the project was to develop a bone composition mimicking HA coating (e.g., CDHA), which is possible only by the use of a low temperature process. However, this process is a slow process. The microwave assisted process is eminently suitable for accelerating the coating deposition kinetics for PEEK and AZ31 substrates. Of late, PEEK implants have become popular, which need coatings at low-temperatures. Considered as an important Mg-alloy, AZ31 alloys need coatings to slow down their degradation rates. The coating process also needs to possess fast kinetics. In both cases, microwave technique is helpful. 

Another intrinsic merit is the use of novel magnesium phosphate (Mg-P) coating materials as an alternative coating material. As opposed conventional calcium phosphates (Ca-Ps), Mg-Ps have better biodegradability and strength. However, these advantages have not been utilized, since the research in Mg-Ps is still nascent. This project has developed pioneering contributions in developing Mg-P coatings.

A third signature is the extension of the coating technology to produce bi-functional coatings on implant surfaces (both polymeric and metallic). This development uses the same technology, but adds additional functionality to coatings by being antibacterial. Bacterial infections are very frequent in implants. Systemic administration of antibiotics works only to a certain extent because of the resistance developed in bacteria. As opposed to antibiotics administration, this effort will modify the CDHA/magnesium phosphates compositions by doping with Ag to accomplish antibacterial properties. Yet another goal is to characterize these coatings in in vivo tests. 

Broader Impacts

The translatory component of our research will provide an advanced-level technology to treat orthopedic problems. According to United States Census Bureau projections, a vast majority of the ""Baby-Boomers"" will require some type of reconstructive surgeries in spine, hips, knees, or teeth. The broader impacts of this proposal are in line with the University of Toledo?s (UT?s) strategic plan, incorporating focal themes such as ""Translational Interfaces of Health Sciences, Engineering, and Health Care"" and ""Science and Technology Education"". The PI is actively collaborating with an implant manufacturer (Orchid-Biocoat) under the auspices of CDMI, a NSF I/UCRC. His project mentored engineering interns under the auspices of the mandatory engineering co-op program at UT. The PI also mentored students from a local high school (Maumee Valley Country Day School) to create an interest in STEM fields.This is highly-selective 130-year old school that places its graduates to prestigious universities of the country. Mr. Nipun Jayatissa has been mentored for the for the last two years in the field of regenerative medicine applications in orthopedics. Nipun has received numerous recognitions of his research prowess at a young age. Last year, he received the 4th grand award at The Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF). As a new activity, hands-on experiments were demonstrated in newly-introduced Women in STEM Day of Meetings (WISDOM) and Latino Youth Summit (LYS) programs.

The potential economic impact is expected to be over $2B in world-wide sales in the next 5 to 10 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the home tonometry market space.   The societal impact, long term, will be better management of glaucoma affecting over 4.3 M Americans each year, reduced disability rates, lower healthcare delivery costs, and greater access to eye diagnostics and care.","Elizabeth Swan

Adults over the age of 40 develop this disease and are sometimes unknowingly going blind. In the US alone, more than 8.7 million office visits are made each year for the diagnosis or treatment of glaucoma. The current treatment is based on attempts to reduce the intraocular pressure and slow down the progression of the disease. Therefore, the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma relies on accurate and frequent measurements of the intraocular pressure. Currently, the most commonly used method, Goldmann applanation tonometery, has to be performed at a hospital due to the required anesthesia and sterilization. The natural diurnal variation is affected by certain activities, food or beverage intake, or medications. Therefore, a single office visit to the physician does not represent the complete picture of IOP fluctuations, which can create difficulties in making a proper diagnosis or a timely determination if the selected treatment is producing the desired results. The frequent measurement of the IOP throughout the day would allow for significant improvement in the treatment outcome and early diagnosis of glaucoma.

This project is aimed at the development of a new method for non-invasive eye pressure measurement though the eye lid, which can be performed at home. The approach uses multiple force sensors combined with advanced signal processing techniques to extract the eye pressure.

Intellectual Merit:

One of the main challenges of developing through-the-eye lid tonometer is the need for  person-specific calibration. Through this project, we have developed a novel calibration method, which allows tonometer calibration using as few as 1-2 measurements. The method relies on a machine learning algorithm processing data from multiple force sensors applied at once.

 

Broader Impact:                     

The project is likely to reduce the need for office visits for diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma and is likely to result in lower patient costs and improved public health. Through participation in the NSF I-Crops program, the research team also established that the commercial impact of the technology in approximately  $1B  in US alone. Similar market opportunities exist in the rest of the developed world.

Autograft and allograft based products are currently used for repair purposes and have several limitations including suboptimal strength, possible negative immune effects and risks of disease transmission. The new technologies and proposed products overcome the drawbacks posed by autografts and allografts.  These new product technologies are potentially stronger, bioactive, more biocompatible and completely degradable while being ideally suited for load-bearing bone healing and soft tissue repair and regeneration applications. There are estimated to be over 1 million bone graft implants performed each year throughout the world. Production costs for the proposed technologies will be in the range of $500 per implant, yielding a $2000 net profit per implant. Our objective in the first 3 years is to achieve a 2% market share of bone grafts (20,000 grafts) which would provide $40 million in revenue per year. Every year, 400,000 rotator cuff repair procedures performed in the US require the use of a tendon augmentation device. Production costs are $1,000 per implant, yielding a $4000 profit per implant. We conservatively believe that 30% of repair operations would benefit from our soft tissue regeneration system (120,000 repairs) and that a 10% market share would be 12,000 repairs. This translates to a profit of 48 million per year. 

In order to move these technologies to commercialization, we have categorized different products into short-term, mid-term and long-term time frames spanning 1 to 5 years. Short-term products include grafts fabricated from the materials alone without inclusion of any biologics. The short-term products, classified as devices or implants, create a short route to 510k FDA clearance (approval).  An ample financial base from the aforementioned products will allow re-investment of R & D efforts toward the commercialization of subsequent products or to pursue an out-license or acquisition exit after subsequent 510k approvals. The strong patent portfolio and constant revenue from the initial product commercialization will create a self-sustainable academic centered innovation ecosystem. All these activities will ensure workforce development, create new jobs and businesses, and foster economic development. 

Third party partnerships engaged to transfer the technologies to the market domain include technology niche analysis, business plan development, and initiation of new startup ventures for existing products and new products. The potential economic impact is expected to approximate 100 million per year in the next 2 to 3 years which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the orthopaedic device fixation, repair, and regeneration market.

Societal impact short term, the proposed devices successfully address issues and drawbacks related to biological grafts currently used and will improve treatment efficiency/cost, enhance patient compliance and contribute to a better quality of life. The developed products will be used as alternatives to current grafts.  Identified material compositions and designs may find application in the delivery of growth factors, antibiotics and pain medications for treating a variety of musculoskeletal ailments in the long term. This proposed project has immense economic potential as well as a broad impact in education by bridging the interfaces of chemistry, biology, medicine and materials science.

Educationally, the proposed research will focus on the recruitment and training of underrepresented minorities at the undergraduate and graduate levels, thus ensuring a competitive and diverse dissemination of scientific knowledge. Students and fellows will be engaged in business plan development and encouraged to complete an internship with the third party investors to enhance their entrepreneurial skill sets.","Mikael P, Amini AR, Basu J, Arellano-Jimenez MJ, Laurencin CT, Sanders M, Carter BC, Nukavarapu SP~Functionalized Carbon Nanotube Reinforced Scaffolds for Bone Regenerative Engineering: Fabrication, in vitro and in vivo Evaluation.~Biomedical Materials~19~2014~035001~~035001~0~ ~0~ ~07/10/2020 04:03:39.996000000, Lee, P.

The repair and replacement of damaged hard tissues such as bone is a major clinical problem in the U.S. and around the world. In the U.S. alone, more than 500,000 hip and knee replacements are performed and over 6 million fractures are treated each year. With an aging population, the numbers of bone related injuries worldwide are projected to significantly increase requiring surgical intervention to treat damaged tissue. The current market for bone grafting and implants represents over a 4.8-billion-dollar industry, which is expected to grow exponentially in the future. Thus, there is a great need for developing biological graft substitutes with adequate mechanical and pore properties to achieve effective bone repair and regeneration. This grant developed biodegradable mechanically strong micro-nanostructured bone graft prototypes for bone healing applications with high commercialization potential. As pertinent as bone injuries, are soft tissue injuries, which include damage to skin, muscles, ligaments and tendons throughout the body. Tendon tears inflict all stages of life, encompassing acute, degenerative and traumatic injuries. In the civilian population 50% of musculoskeletal injuries involve tendon and ligament soft tissue. For instance, tendon tears represent a major portion of the personal medical costs and loss of GDP attributed to musculoskeletal pathology, totaling $127.4 billion and $849 billion or 7.7% loss of gross domestic product. This grant developed micro-nanostructured biodegradable fiber matrices for soft tissue repair and regeneration with a potential commercial product.

 

Intellectual Merit: This project proposed to develop two biodegradable scaffold technologies for bone and soft tissue regeneration applications. The investigators developed prototype synthetic bone graft substitutes for load bearing bone healing applications, as well as micro-noncontoured polymeric fiber matrices with the ability to deliver bioactive factors to promote tendon healing. The novel material compositions and micro-nanostructures identified and developed have great commercialization potential in the field of orthopedic fixation devices. Particularly the polysaccharide material platform we have developed is potentially stronger, more biocompatible and can be customized to meet the needs of biological sciences and biomedical engineering. We identified several product segments for which there exists a need for a degradable and biocompatible material platform and combined them with mechanical competence &ndash; a must for successful musculoskeletal applications. From the findings of this research we have published a total of 21 research articles, 18 invited book chapters and 22 conference presentations. Additionally, 3 patent disclosures have been made on applications based on the novel materials and technologies developed. Broader Impact: This work has provided greater understanding on the role of micro-nanostructures in musculoskeletal regeneration and addressed fundamental issues, particularly the effects of in vitro microenvironment and tissue formation in vivo. The developed products have the potential to be used as alternatives to current grafts, and identified material compositions and designs may find application in the delivery of growth factors, antibiotics and pain medications. This project has helped us to identify opportunities and realize commercialization potential of multiple orthopedic fixation devices. This interdisciplinary project has also demonstrated a broad impact in education by bridging the interfaces of chemistry, biology, and materials science. Educationally, this research project promoted training of underrepresented minorities at the undergraduate and graduate levels, thus ensuring a competitive and diverse dissemination of scientific knowledge. These funds were also helpful in training 5 high schools, 21 undergraduate independent study research, 13 senior design project students, 5 graduate and 2 postdoctoral fellows on various aspects of the technology development and commercialization aspects. Many undergraduate students are co-authors on publications that have resulted from this work. Project tasks were accomplished by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows under the supervision of the project PIs. The students and fellows met with third party investors and gained insights on product development, innovation, regulatory guidelines and commercialization aspects. In addition, the PI has shared the research findings in the classroom and developed a new course on drug delivery aimed at the undergraduate and graduate level. This grant has also provided opportunity for undergraduate summer research. The PI and his team have actively participated in school outreach programs, mentoring juniors and seniors from underrepresented minority groups. In this way, the educational efforts from this grant have aimed to promote, cultivate, and sustain an educational STEM pipeline.

The technology is based on unique characteristics of high-power widely-tunable two-color laser in a novel two-chip vertical external-cavity surface-emitting laser (VECSEL).  Access to the VECSELs' high-Q intracavity circulating power with orthogonal polarization provide  highly efficient mean for  type-II difference frequency generation (DFG) of THz radiation.  Current THz sources suffer from low-efficiency, low output power in the range of tens of micro-Watts, limited operating temperature or large size and high cost. The intracavity THz generation in the two-chip cavity promises to overcome the limitations by providing high CW (continuous wave) power in the 10s of milli-Watts combined with mature and low-cost semiconductor technology, filling a major gap in THz technology. Targeted frequency in the 0.1 to 10 THz range will be achieved by accurately adjusting wavelength difference between the two chips in the 0.3-30 nm and selecting a suitable nonlinear crystal. The Air innovation partnership provides means to fabricate and demonstrate a high-power CW THz source  in a compact prototype, transforming  the future of THz technology. The business objective is to commercialize a compact, low-cost tunable THz source covering the broad THz spectrum. 
 
The transformative impact of high-power THz source will be in various fields of science and technology including medical, pharmaceutical and manufacturing in the next decade.

During the project, a new Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VECSEL) wafer was grown in order to achieve higher power outputs. In our previous designs, maximum outputs were typically less than 10W but in the new wafer material outputs in excess of 20W were achieved. A T-Cavity VECSEL design was then implemented for efficient intracavity difference generation (DFG) for THz outputs. The new wafer material lead to high circulating outputs powers of ~200W at each wavelength in the T-cavity VECSEL laser.

As the T-Cavity design exploits the design flexibility of the open cavity VECSEL this allows for access to the high circulating power and results in efficient DFG. In addition, excellent beam quality and overlap were obtained which were needed for THz generation via DFG. In order to achieve efficient THz generation we chose to use MgO:PPLN nonlinear crystal as it possess high transparency in the near IR and can generate THz outputs in the desired 0.6-2THz range. While performing the experiments we also constructed a packaged prototype and for the first time demonstrated T-cavity operation off of an optical bench.

In summary, during the project we made many advances in VECSEL technology and achieved many project goals including:

Advancement      in high-power VECSEL design

Our overarching mission through and beyond accelerating innovation research (AIR) is to enable personal manufacturing for everyone through design. To this end we developed a framework for interacting with virtual shapes with natural hand motions in 3D space using depth cameras. We developed a prototype called z-Pots and tested it widely with users of all kinds. We were able to validate our prototype in demonstrations in major venues. More broadly the culture of visual communication is strongly influenced and affected by the technology and our work will help change this through spatial interaction metaphors and algorithms. New design concepts, methods and tools to support transformative design thinking are a key source for innovation and it is now recognized as the single most important ingredient for growing our economy. In the longer term this body of continuing work developing and translating academic research to real world tools will facilitate a paradigm shift where designing naturally in 3D will become a part of our nations creative design capacity.

The translated science has a unique combination of high sensitivity, good stability, and excellent reproducibility, which provide exemplary performance and efficacy when compared to the leading competing technologies of mechanical and electronic sensors. The project accomplishes this goal by developing new vacuum techniques resulting in a prototype glass cell that will enable laser cooling in a commercially practical device. The partnership engages Triad Technology, Inc to provide guidance in the spectroscopic cell market space and other aspects such as financing and commercialization as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. 

 The potential economic impact is expected to be up to one billion dollars in the next twenty years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the precision sensor market. The societal impact, long term, will be significant improvement in a wide range of vital technologies, including vehicle navigation, energy exploration, threat detection, and secure communication.",,,"Laser cooling is a technique that easily and rapidly produces a sample of atoms at nearly absolute zero temperature. These atoms can be useful for many applications, including precision sensing, non-linear optics, and quantum information. However, it is necessary to confine the atoms in an ultra-high vacuum environment, which typically requires a bulky apparatus and consumes significant electrical power.

This project supported an effort to develop a new type of glass cell that would be more suitable for practical applications. The cell can maintain ultra high vacuum conditions without the use of an active vacuum pump, and it would include a source of atoms for cooling. The cell is made from a type of glass that is particularly impermeable to atmospheric gasses, and includes a chemical ?getter? material that can trap most contaminant molecules that do penetrate in.

Several challenges were resolved. We were able to demonstrate laser cooling in a sealed cell for many weeks, and our studies established how to regulate the amount of atoms in the cell, as needed for the cooling effect.

Preliminary work was done on a prototype cell using glass with optical quality lower than desired. An improve prototype was construct using a glass frit construction technique. This cell did not perform well, as we were unable to maintain the required amount of atoms for cooling. We believe that atoms were being trapped in the glass frit material. Based on this result, we are continue to work on development of a high quality cell that is constructed using a different technique.

Regarding broader impacts, three graduate students and one undergraduate student worked on and contributed to the project. These students learned new techniques in vacuum processing and analysis, surface physics and chemistry, and materials design. They also gained practice in research techniques by developing and carrying out experiments to characterize the cells. This expertise will contribute to their productivity in their scientific careers.

Because of the nature of this project as technology transfer, these students and others in my research group were exposed to a type of entrepreneurial thinking that is not typically part of the academic research experience. One of the students participated in a pitch competition which he described as very informative. I expect that all the students involved will be more sensitive to future opportunities to apply their scientific research to commercial and technological problems.

The expected economic impact is $300k to $500k in annual operational savings at treatment plants that adopt the translated technology, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in wastewater treatment within 3 to 5 years. The societal impact, long term, will be the development of a cost-effective technology for removal of nitrogen from wastewater, preventing fertilization of waterways and potential for formation of destructive anoxic dead zones while also creating opportunities for energy recovery, converting nitrous oxide from harmful greenhouse gas to a new source of renewable energy.","Scherson, Y.

Current methods of removing nitrogen from wastewater are energy-intensive and generate large amounts of biosolids for disposal. New technologies are needed that are energy-efficient and generate few biosolids. This research evaluates the potential of CANDO, a novel wastewater treatment technology, that removes nitrogen from wastewater by converting it into nitrous oxide.  Nitrous oxide is a useful energy source that is widely used as a power boost for race cars and as a rocket propellent. The CANDO process recovers nitrous oxide as a new source of renewable energy in wastewater treatment. 

Because nitrous oxide is a serious greenhouse gas, it cannot be allowed to enter the air.  if it is collected, however, it can be used a source of renewable energy. In the CANDO process, the nitrogen that is present in wastewater as ammonia is converted into nitrous oxide through a two-step process:  in the first step, aerobic  microorganisms convert the ammonia into nitrite; in the second step, a different set of microorganisms converts the nitrite into nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is then swept out of the water into the air that is used to combust methane produced by the anaerobic digestion of waste organic matter. This research demonstrates that CANDO can remove 95% of the nitrogen from the water with 75% conversion to nitrous oxide.  In a trial test of nitrous oxide injection into a biogas-fed engine at a full-scale wastewater treatment plant, energy production increased by 5%.  The CANDO process uses naturally-occurring and robust microorganisms that are fast-growing and robust.  While initial pilot-scale test results are promising, further pilot-scale testing is needed to optimize the process and simplify operations.

Minimally-invasive laser ablation is a medical procedure that provides a means of rapidly delivering heat to target diseased tissue in the body and will be used in this project to kill focal cancerous lesions in brain as well as diseased neurological tissue, such as epilepsy. The translated computing technology has the following unique features: (1) the predictive capabilities of the prototype device will assist in minimizing the surgical impact on the patient and (2) the prototype device will be tightly coupled to existing FDA approved procedures in humans and rigorously validated to assure accurate predictions. This provides exemplary improvement in the efficacy of the procedure as no comparable technology currently exists and the neurosurgeon does not have the capability to a-priori visualize outcomes for complex treatment scenarios (multiple lasers/trajectories) near essential anatomical structures.

In particular, we have developed computer models for predicting the outcome of laser-induced ablation of brain tumors. Similar to how a neurosurgeon utilizes previous experiences acquired during his training, we have implemented computer models that utilize imaging information acquired during previous patient MRgLITT therapies to predict the therapy outcome. Current implementations achieve 70% accuracy in predicting the therapeutic kill zone of the tumor.  Further, the high performance algorithms for predicting the bioheat transfer have been implemented on graphics processing co-processor technology that has enabled an operating room portable hardware solution.  The system interacts with three dimensional visualizations of medical imaging data and the run time of the simulations is well within clinical time constraints.

The translated science/technology has the following unique features: 1) it uses machine learning to identify fault type and fault location in the PV arrays; 2) it will be able to clear faults that traditional fuses or other fault protection devices cannot presently clear; 3) it will be a fully integrated fuse holder and box that has user interface allowing the user to monitor the PV array performance. The new solar PV protection technology will be able to isolate, clear, and identify the type and location of PV fault. This includes several types of faults that presently pose fire hazards to PV installations, such as line-to-line faults that may occur when branches or wires accidentally connect two different PV arrays in a big installation.  The new, smart fuse protection adds exemplary safety, reliability, and even increased energy delivery when compared to the leading competing science/technology, such as traditional fuses or circuit breakers in this market space. 

The project accomplishes this goal by running smart fault detection algorithms that utilize machine learning, nonlinear model prediction of PVs, intelligent measurements of PV currents and voltages, resulting in a method to identify hazardous fault location and types.  Prototype smart over-current protection devices will be built with miniaturized self-contained electronics. The protection devices will be tested in PV installations to demonstrate their commercial viability and benefits.

The partnership engages Mersen USA Newburyport-LLC to provide guidance in the fuse/over-current protection manufacturing and commercial market. Mersen will help manufacture the prototype smart fuse holders and test them in their lab PV facilities.

The smart PV protection devices will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this PV installation market, since each installation of solar PV array must utilize (usually multiple) over-current protection devices, such as fuses.

Branches may fall from trees and cause damage or connections to the earth.  Inadvertent power flow may flow from solar panel to solar panel. Sometimes, even, these faults may cause reverse power flow into the solar panel and the panel may be absorbing power instead of producing power.  Impact of these faults can range from being minimal to becoming dangerously hazardous.  Minimal impact may occur when a fault would only reduce system efficiency or slightly accelerate aging/life-cycle.  On the other hand, hazardous faults may cause fire hazards.  Furthermore, PV systems pose additional challenges because it is difficult to shut down PV modules completely during faults, since they are always energized by sunlight in daytime.

To deal with the possible fault hazards, conventional fault detection and protection methods usually add overcurrent protection devices (OCPD), such as fuses, and ground fault detection interrupters (GFDI) within PV components. However, it has recently been discovered that certain faults in PV arrays may not be cleared by OCPD or GFDI due to non-linear output characteristics of PV arrays, high fault impedances, low irradiance conditions, or maximum power point tracker (MPPT) of PV inverters. This difficulty brings blind spots in the protection schemes, leading to the possible DC arcing and fire hazards.

This research project developed, designed, built and tested fault detection systems that were made specifically for PV systems.  The approach was to add computational processing power to existing fault detection methods through additional digital signal processing.  Then machine learning algorithms are used to learn about the PV installation and then be able to identify when the faults occur in real-time.  Previously undetectable line-to-line faults can now be detected, thereby making the PV system safer.  A commercial grade combiner (fuse) box, which is normally included at each PV installation, has been built that includes these new machine learning algorithms. 

The smart PV protection devices developed in this project can contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this PV installation market, since each installation of solar PV array must utilize (usually multiple) over-current protection devices, such as fuses.   The societal impact, long term, will be improved safety of any PV installation, increased energy yield due to immediate knowledge of fault, and better diagnosis in real-time of any reductions of energy yield caused by PV arrays that may need repair.

State Street,West Lafayette,IN,47907-2057,West Lafayette,US,4	0,"This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating science and technology in nanoscale optical antenna to fill the gap for Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR). The translated science and technology in nanoscale optical antenna has the following unique features: the nanoscale optical antenna focuses light into nanoscale size with high efficiency, and moreover, can be manufactured using industrial standard technology for mass production.  HAMR has been identified as the next generation data storage technology. The key component in HAMR is a near field transducer (NFT) for producing a light spot of tens of nanometers in size for localized heating. The proposed nanoscale optical antenna is an ideal candidate for being used as the NFT to provide high efficiency and a small light spot when compared to the other NFT designs. 

The project accomplishes this goal by proof-of concept design and analysis, prototype development, and demonstration of a fully functional NFT. Our partnership engages Advanced Storage Technology Consortium (ASTC), the consortium of the data storage companies, to provide guidance in the prototype development and commercialization as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to affect the next generation hard disk drives which currently have a market of 600 million units per year, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the data storage industry. 

The societal impact, long term, will be on science and engineering and human resource development. The outcome of this project will have direct impact on the development of the next generation data storage technology. The project will also advance the relevant science and engineering. The ability to concentrate light into a nanoscale spot with high efficiency has significant impact not only on the HAMR technology development but also many other areas, from biological/chemical sensing to nano-photonics devices. Results of fundamental research will be broadly disseminated by journal publications, conference presentations, and websites, including Purdue's nanoHUB web portal. The proposed research will also contribute to human resource development, including providing graduate and undergraduate students with trainings in interdisciplinary areas and experience in technology transfer, integrating research outcomes with curriculum, outreaching to high school students, and recruiting and educating students from under-represented groups.","Zhou, N., Traverso, L.

HAMR has been identified by the data storage industry as the technology for next generation high capacity data storage. When the density of data in a magnetic hard drive continues to increase and the bit size decrease, the magnetic storage medium must be made of a material with high coercivity to guarantee its stability. At some point of storage density, the bit size is so small and the coercivity correspondingly so high that the magnetic field cannot be made strong enough, and data can no longer be written to the hard drive medium using the magnetic field available in a read-write head in a hard drive. HAMR mitigates this problem by temporarily and locally changing the coercivity of the magnetic storage medium: a laser beam is used to radiate the medium through an optical near field transducer (NFT) and raises the temperature of the medium above the Curie temperature. As a result, the medium temporarily loses coercivity and a realistically achievable magnetic field can write data to the recording medium.

The key component in the HAMR technology is the optical near field transducer for producing a light spot of the bit size for heating, which is of the order of tens of nanometers, significantly below the diffraction limit of light which is the minimum spot size that light can be focused into using conventional far field optics, of the order of 0.5 x the wavelength of light.  In this project, we developed and demonstrated antennas and manufacturing methods that can be used for the HAMR technology and mass production. In working with the leading data storage companies, this project will have an immediate impact to the development of the HAMR, the next generation data storage technology.

This is a significant issue and it is estimated that up to 90% of pharmaceutical pipeline drug candidates have poor water solubility (which if not solved will lead directly to poor oral absorption). Part of the reason for the low solubility is that drug molecules tend to form crystals, and it can be difficult to break the crystal lattice to get the drug into solution. Our approach is to use polymers to disrupt the crystal lattice and make amorphous drug-polymer solids, which are called amorphous solid dispersions or ASDs.

To achieve this goal, we have successfully introduced a new family of polymers based on cellulose, a naturally occurring biopolymer. Specifically, these are cellulose ethers with omega-carboxy alkanoate ester side chains, designed to be more hydrophilic (water loving), slightly water soluble, with continuing ability to stabilize drugs against crystallization but with faster drug release. Using one example from this family of polymers, we have shown using the model poorly water soluble compound, ritonavir (used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infections), that we can indeed improve the drug solubility using this approach, and importantly, prevent the drug from converting back to the less soluble crystalline form. These polymers are important leads for development of superior, fully functional commercial ASD polymers.

We have also shown that the ASD formulations with some of our new polymers lead to improved absorption of quercetin (natural compound in nuts and vegetables that has activity against cancer and other ailments) in rats, and rifampin (anti-tuberculosis drug) in mice. These proof of concept studies are a critical step towards commercial acceptance of our polymers.

For the new polymers to be useful commercially, they must be amenable to pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. We have demonstrated successful melt extrusion of 6-carboxy-6-deoxycellulose acetate butyrate, a relatively new commercial polymer which we have shown for the first time is an excellent ASD polymer. The fact that it can be melt extruded successfully is unexpected, since the polymer contains both hydroxyl and carboxyl groups and so is susceptible to crosslinking via ester bond formation. Many pharmaceutical companies prefer melt extrudable polymers for commercial ASD formulations since they avoid the use of organic solvents inherent in spray drying, and they permit continuous operation. We are working to extend this very important discovery to our omega-carboxy alkanoate derivatives of cellulose, advancing them further towards commercialization.

The impact on patients, that is to say on all of us, can be quite significant. The enhanced drug solubility and absorption that will result from using our new, specifically designed polymers is expected to reduce the required doses of existing drugs; this can enable reduced medical costs, reduced side effects, reduced variability in drug efficacy, and enable multidrug formulations, smaller and more patient-friendly dosage sizes, and higher patient adherence to dosage regimens (which inevitably translates to higher efficacy). Even more importantly, our polymers can rescue drugs under development that failed due to solubility/absorption issues, and prevent failures of current pipeline drugs for the same reasons. In this way better medications and more of them will reach patients, drug development costs will drop because of reduced failure rates, and pressure on medical costs may decrease.

Preferably, these sensors are simple and do not require any advanced equipment and skilled personnel. The most often used nitro-based explosives possesses an, albeit small, vapor pressure and most explosive devices do not shield the explosive hermetically, particularly when considering improvised explosive devices. Although the development of explosive detectors has progressed enormously over the past decade, simplicity, sensitivity and/or selectivity of such sensors for detecting a broad spectrum of military explosives are still problematic in these days. Thus, there exists an urgent need to develop novel compact, rapid, cost-effective, and ultra-sensitive explosives sensors.

In this project, we aim at fundamentally advancing the field by developing fast and ultra-sensitive portable prototype device to ?read-out? ultra-trace quantities of explosives by naked eye. A number of novel features are introduced to enhance the simplicity, sensitivity and selectivity of the portable device over those reported previously. Two types of integrated explosive-concentrator/sensor membrane or film have been fabricated: one is based on nanoporous stainless steel support coated with zeolite MFI membrane and fluorescent nanofibrous sensing membrane; and the other is based on filter paper coated with gun-sprayed zeolite thin film and fluorescent nanofibrous sensing film (Figure 1). Their performance for naked-eye based explosives detection under a handheld UV light is demonstrated and a better performance is observed for the one using filter paper as the support due to the high gas permeability/low pressure drop. This study provides insights on the understanding of the design of explosive detector with integrated concentrator/sensor as well as the direction for the development of high-performance sensing devices with high gas permeability/low pressure drop. It could pave the roads for future development of ultra-sensitive sensing platform for broad applications.

The concept of ultrasensitive detection of explosive vapors using electrospun nanofibrous membrane with naked eye under UV light in conjunction with a zeolite-based pre-concentrator opens a new venue to the design of engineered nanocomposite based sensing system for broad applications. The work advances the development of explosive detection techniques in general and has an enormous impact on protection of civilian and environment as well as homeland security and anti-terrorism activities. This project not only generates new knowledge and products, but also attracts and trains a new generation of scientists and engineers. The project offers a truly multidisciplinary training ground for undergraduates (including two minority students) and graduate students. In addition, the multidisciplinary nature of the research activity lends itself for dissemination in high profile technical as well as non-technical journals and as a subject of outreach activities. This project results in the integrated explosive concentrator/sensor prototype device, which has been used as the topic for UConn-industry connection, YESS program (for high school students), E2K program (for high school students), undergraduate research projects, as well as teaching materials in undergraduate courses at the University of Connecticut.

The translated dual-mode diagnostic probe has the following unique features: 1) It combines both biomechanical and impedance measurement in the same device, which likely enhances sensitivity and specificity; 2) It's detection zone can be designed down to 2 mm in diameter, enabling a minimally invasive profile and fine local analysis; 3) It interrogates tissue through a width and depth equivalent to twice its diameter, enabling identification of deeper tissue phenomena with less invasion; 4) it is real-time, alleviating more costly and time consuming follow-on analysis and permitting instantaneous decision making for the user without risk of losing the location; 5) it can be manufactured very cheaply using flexible electronics.  These features will provide improved diagnostic performance over current approaches that utilize only one-mode of sensation in this market space (e.g. Dune Biomedical), and significant time and cost savings compared to traditional excisional tissue biopsies.  Furthermore, this technology will enable interrogation without tissue destruction, which is of paramount importance for very sensitive tissue regions (e.g. glands, nerves, lymph nodes) in this market space.  The project accomplishes this goal by optimizing the probe geometry, electrical stimulation profiles, and pressure ranges that safely quantify biomechanical and impedance measurement in soft tissues. These results will generate a field serviceable prototype that will establish the foundation for evaluation in potential markets and commercialization.  

This proposal will engage the Cornell Center for Technology Commercialization, Cornell biotechnology Institute and partner with the McGovern Business Incubator to provide business development and scale-up guidance, access to financial networks, and connection to future industrial partners that are experienced in navigating the diverse regulatory and manufacturing landscapes as they pertain to the potential to translate the dual-mode along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.  When successful, the potential economic impact is expected to be widespread, filling needs in markets ranging from food science to cancer margin detection. The first market area of pre-term labor will be focused on in this proposal, and it is anticipated that clinical trials in humans can be initiated within the next 5 years.  When successful, this low-cost, quantitative, real-time assessment tool will enhance U.S. competitiveness in medical diagnostic technologies. Societally, access to real-time quantitative diagnostics, especially bringing that technology closer, potentially in the hands of the end-user, provides significant cost and time savings, leading to a better quality of life.",,,"The overall objective of our Award was to design, build, and test a novel device that has the capacity to measure electrical and biomechanical signatures of soft tissues. This device takes advantage of innovative technology developed in our lab that can simultaneously measure local tissue deformation and minute changes in bioelectricity due to water transport at the tissue and sub-cellular levels. Many changes in soft tissue biology, for example during disease processes, can be characterized by changes in tissue stiffness and hydration. One advantage of the device technology is its ability to measure these features non-destructively, which is to say the test leaves the tissue completely intact in contrast to regular tissue biopsies that rip tissue out of the body.

During this Award project period, we were able to identify a range of pressures and electrical current we could apply safely to various tissues. We further developed a novel electrical circuit controller that can rapidly cycle between test parameters so that we can sweep 5 orders of magnitude of electrical frequency at multiple pressures within a few seconds. We further developed a data analysis software that can automatically process the raw data into actual mechanical and electrical performance values that could be used to make diagnoses on tissue health. More recently, we completely redeisgned the device prototype to be a self contained system, ruggedized and portable for the field. This system was transported to several distant sites, and testing demonstrated similar measurements in field conditions compared to those generated in the lab. With this new device, we now have the capacity to use this device in field/clinical settings. One important application we have begun is investigating the potential of this device to predict risk of pre-term birth (PTB). PTB is ultimately due to a biomechanical tissue failure, but also is accompanied by pronounced changes in tissue hydration. Interestingly, it is a clinical problem for both animals and humans, and as such we have broad buy-in to investigate. The results of this Award have provided critical preliminary data to augment our research collaborations with other scientists, clinicians, and advocacy foundations. We hope to advance these research gains in follow on research support. 

Finally, this project contributed substantially to the engineering training and professional development of 1 PhD student, 6 Master of engineering students, and several undergraduates. In participating in this project, these students learned key skills and expertise that contributed to their success in obtaining career employment after graduation. We were also able to demonstrate the technology as part of educational outreach activities to K-12 students and teachers.

The translated technology has the following unique features: increased product water recovery due to reduction in scaling from sulfate and carbonate salts of calcium on the surface of Reverse Osmosis (RO) membranes without requiring addition of any anti-scaling chemicals. Threats of barium sulfate scaling and consequent fouling of membranes, wherever present, may also be avoided. 

The project accomplishes this goal by integrating a self-regenerated ion exchange system along with the RO process. An appropriately designed mixed bed of anion exchange resins significantly reduce sulfate concentration at the membrane inlet, thus avoiding sulfate precipitation. The reject of the RO membrane process is used to regenerate the anion exchange resins without needing addition of external chemicals. 

The potential economic impact is expected to be a significant reduction in operating expenses of the desalination plants due to elimination of anti-scaling chemicals. The partnership engages an ion exchange resin manufacturer and an engineering firm to move into the growing brackish water desalination market space globally through validation of the technology under representative conditions. From a business viewpoint, the innovation can also be retrofitted for existing RO plants, thus expanding the market for the proposed technology. 

From a broader perspective, the proposed work will also lay the basis for an in-land desalination technology which does not create a reject stream containing environmentally objectionable anti-scaling chemicals requiring post treatment. With higher product water recovery, the reject brine will be smaller in volume, thus reducing the land requirement for disposal.

California has experienced drought conditions in 11 of the last 15 years &ndash; a trend that may not change in the near future. Since fresh water resources are dwindling or uncertain, an increased emphasis is being laid on impaired brackish water sources that still remain largely untapped. Brackish water with relatively high total dissolved solids (TDS) is the primary candidate to replenish the water supply and sustain economic prosperity. Treatment of brackish water is accomplished through the use of reverse osmosis (RO) where water, under high pressure, is forced through a semi-permeable membrane which extracts pure water from the brackish source leaving behind a concentrate stream high in TDS. The costs associated with disposal of concentrated reject brine, especially in inland locations, can constitute a significant portion of the operating costs. In addition, anti-scaling chemicals, dosed in the feed water to prevent membrane fouling, are eventually discharged to the environment.

Increasing the recovery of the RO process will result in a reduction of produced waste brine, but this is not immediately possible as at higher recoveries the solubility of certain salts is exceeded. One of the most common precipitates formed during RO is calcium sulfate. However, precipitation can be prevented by removing and replacing sulfate by chloride.

Ion exchange (IX) technology can be used to selectively remove and replace sulfate by chloride as a pretreatment for RO processes. The reject of the RO process, before disposal, can then be used to regenerate the IX columns thereby eliminating the need for any additional chemical input; Figure 1 in the attachments shows how the IX-RO process operates.

The efficiency of this Hybrid Ion Exchange-Reverse Osmosis process (HIX-RO) process is dependent on the ability of the ion exchange column to switch between being sulfate selective at the feed concentration, and chloride selective at the reject concentration. Achieving this goal is possible by ""tuning"" the IX resin bed for a given feedwater/reject combination. This goal can be achieved by mixing together characteristically different IX resins, the IX bed can be tuned to ensure high process efficiency regardless of the feedwater composition.

Results demonstrate that a properly designed HIX-RO process is able to significantly reduce the concentration of sulfate at the feed to the RO system. For the feedwater studied, we were able to increase the recovery of the RO process from 50% to 80% reducing the volume of produced waste brine by 40% without any potential for calcium sulfate scaling and without requiring the use of any external regenerant as shown in Figure 2.

Based on the promising results, a US patent for the invention was filed for global coverage (Application #61/828,477). In August 2015, Lehigh University and Trevi Systems (a California-based company specializing in low-energy desalination processes) have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to collaborate in the project in California using the HIX-RO process. This collaboration is the first step to testing this process at pilot-scale.

The United Nations estimates that almost 30-40% of all energy in the world is used within buildings. The energy consumption of buildings can largely be blamed upon cooling, heating, and lighting required to render the structures habitable. A major portion of solar radiation is transmitted directly to building interiors through their windows.  During summer months and in warm climates, this solar heat gain necessitates increased use of air-conditioning, straining the electrical grid and increasing a building?s carbon footprint.

In essence, using our client side apps developed for different platforms, all the documents will be automatically encrypted before they are sent to the cloud and stored in the cloud in an encrypted format. Therefore, the cloud service provider will not have any access to stored documents. In addition, encryption keys will be automatically managed by our server side solution.

In addition, our server will never store any information related to documents in plaintext form. 

This project will allow researchers to understand best practices in managing encrypted data in the context of cloud and mobile services. In addition, it will allow them to see the performance and limitations of current encrypted data management solutions (including ours) in real operating environments.  Longer-term, if this project is successful, it could substantially decrease the privacy and economic risks of information disclosure due to usage of cloud and mobile services. This could have a direct economic impact, as well as increasing trust in using cloud based document management services, opening the way for new applications that would today be considered infeasible due to lack of necessary security and compliance mechanisms.",,,"As a part of this I-corp project, we explored the feasibility of commercializing cloud security tool named SingleCrypt. Our proposed tool, SingleCrypt, could be used on top of existing cloud storage services such as Amazon S3, Dropbox and Google Drive to enable secure document management in the cloud. In essence, using our client side apps developed for different platforms, all the documents will be automatically encrypted before they are sent to the cloud and stored in the cloud in an encrypted format. Therefore, the cloud service provider will not have any access to stored documents? potentially sensitive content. In addition, encryption keys will be automatically managed by our server side solution. Using our techniques developed as a part of our prior NSF supported projects, our server side implementation will provide efficient similarity search over encrypted data, role-based access control, secure document sharing, and audit log generation. Furthermore, due to our proposed design that separates encryption keys into multiple pieces, any potential hacking into our server cannot be used to recover any document stored in the cloud. In addition, our server will never store any documents. Using our tool, companies can define access control policies for their employees, monitor employee behavior, and track how documents are shared etc. In addition, our service can automatically backup, load balance and migrate the data to a different cloud service provider as needed.

As a part of this I-corp project, we talked to nearly 100 potential customers to understand their  cloud based document sharing service needs and explore whether SingleCrypt could address their pain points. During our customer interviews, we quickly realized that certain customer segments (e.g., large banks) are not ready to embrace public cloud based solutions for storing and sharing sensitive data.  In addition, some existing cloud service companies claim that they can address the security concerns by encrypting the stored data and hold the encryption keys in the cloud as well. During our customer interviews, we tried to explain that if cloud service provider has access to encryption keys, than they can decrypt the data at any time and may disclose it to anyone easily. Especially, after recent incidents that show the data stored in the cloud is not secure, we saw an increase interest in our proposed solution and received some encouraging feedback that made us to believe that there could be a market for SingleCrypt.

As a part our commercialization goal, we implemented a basic SingleCrypt prototype with very limited features to see the feasibility of the proposed approach. Initial results indicate that SingleCrypt can address most of the cloud based document sharing security issues with very little overhead. Currently, we are planning to submit a NSF SBIR proposal to raise funds to develop a prototype with more features that are needed for a minimum viable product.  In addition, we are considering to apply NSF PFI:AIR-TT program to raise funding for such prototype development.

This study will be based on electrochemistry and surface characterization of coated and uncoated metals subject to corrosive environments. The Environmental Chemistry & Technology (EC&T) program team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will work to establish the links between the type of oxide used in making the coatings, the physical properties of the resulting porous film, and the required corrosion deterring properties. The traditional approach to anti-corrosion focuses on fully covering the surface with a thick layer to avoid the penetration of an electrolyte. This project has the potential to elucidate the role of nanopores on diffusion and reaction and thus to develop understanding of the role of nano-porosity in preventing corrosion.

The broader impacts of the project are that it may open up opportunities for new research in the field.  Corrosion is a worldwide drain on resources, costing about 3-4% of the economic output of industrialized countries. The nature of this project conveys broad impacts from technological and environmental points of view. These coatings are made from sol-gel chemistries, which are water-based and do not require organic solvents.  Since the final products are metal oxides, the coatings are practically inert from a food safety point of view, in addition to having lower VOC emissions than those derived from the application of organic anti-corrosion coatings in a variety of other contexts.  Therefore, these coatings may become an environmentally friendly alternative for coating cans and other food-related products and also may have the potential to provide solutions to corrosion problems in a multiplicity of other settings.",,,"The scope and diversity of problems caused by corrosion cost the US alone hundreds of billions dollars per year. The interactions between metals and their environment cause these materials prone to oxidize resulting in structural deterioration. Iron rust formation is a classic &ndash;and still problematic&ndash; example, sometimes produced by the sole presence of air and water.

Steel is a versatile and ubiquitous material, made by alloying iron with other materials to obtain products more resistant to corrosion. Low-grade steels are usually alloyed with carbon. Although not entirely corrosion-resistant (even prone to atmospheric corrosion), carbon steels are relatively cheap to make. Stainless alloys incorporate metals such as chromium, vanadium or nickel, making them 3 or more times expensive. Specialty stainless steels, used in highly corrosive enviroments, can drive up costs even higher.

Coatings (paints) are an economical alternative, as covering metal surfaces may be more viable than improving the quality of the metal body. Most coatings are based in organic polymers. Depending on the application, these coatings can perform reasonably well. However, they may present issues such as low adhesion strength, low resistance to abrasion, limited use at high temperatures, emissions of volatile organic carbons (VOC) during their application and potential release of toxic polymers once applied.

This work focused on developing a ceramic coating from a nanoparticle suspension of zirconium dioxide ZrO2 (zirconia), a non-toxic oxide, from sol-gel chemistry techniques. Ceramic coatings attach strongly and are suitable for high temperatures. Our suspensions are aqueous-based, thus no toxic VOC are emitted during curing and use. Ceramic coatings, however, do have issues such as cracking and non-uniform distribution. However, If correctly applied, the nanoparticles comprising the ceramic coating form layers of hundreds of nanometers in thickness, making them compliant with surface expansion and contraction. Futhermore, the nanoparticulate suspensions employed to coat substrates are stable and can be stored for several months. Zirconia may be considered a very passive material, thus its incorporation on the outer layer of steel is thought to reduce the rate of iron oxidation by placing this surface coating of ZrO2 on an already oxidized surface. It should be noted that the coated metals require to be heated to sinter the nanoparticles into a film, which usually contains pores of a size

in the angstrom-nanometer scale.

In our studies, we developed a protocol and validated the efficacy of these films to enhance the corrosion resistance of a low-grade, carbon steel alloy from immersion in sodium chloride. A 35 g/l solution was chosen for testing. The goal is to provide a non-toxic, durable and resistant alternative coating that can significantly enhance the use of low-grade materials in corrosive environments. In order to obtain a well-adhered coating less prone to crack, surface preparation is critical. The nanoparticles bind covalently with the surface, thus a high-energy hydrophilic surface is required prior to coating. Steels are inherently hydrophobic, thus they were heat treated to render the surface with a thin oxide layer. In order to avoid rust formation, the atmosphere during heating was modified to promote the formation of the more stable magnetite (Fe3O4) than the rust component hematite (Fe2O3). In addition to controlling the atmosphere, we also optimized the heating temperature and time, with the goal of minimizing these two variables without compromising the quality of the oxide layer. The quality of the coating was also affected by the surface roughness. Sanding using 600 grit paper significantly improved the anti-corrosion properties, probably by reducing the presence of micro-environments that catalyze redox activity leading to corrosion.

Educational and outreach programs based on this research broadened the participation of underrepresented groups in science and technology and trained multidisciplinary scientists and engineers through an active collaboration with the Sandia National Laboratories and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. This research led to an invention on fabricating ultra-sharp blades using semiconductor.  NSF subsequently funded an PFI:AIR-TT grant to help in developing prototypes of such blades.

To date, one major challenge in nanoelectronics and device research is the effective joining of nanoelements (such as nanowires or carbon nanotubes) with low contact resistance to obtain reliable electrical and thermal interconnection.  In this project, the PIs will synthesize several promising lead-free nanosolders, in the form of isotropic and anisotropic nanostructures (nanospheres, nanorods, nanowires, etc), and determine the fundamental properties underlying their potential applications in nanoscale assembly and nano-joining.  Melting points of nanosolders, nanoscale wetting, inter-metallic formation, and phase transformation will be studied.  The potential issues of nanosolders, including surface oxidation, will be probed and addressed through collaboration with local electronics companies in the New England and US Northeast Region.

If successful, this interdisciplinary collaborative effort will provide a pathway into further miniaturization of nanoelectronic devices with high quality and reliability.  Lead-free nanosolder materials and nano-soldering techniques are expected to play a key role in the electronics industry, as well as in various areas of advanced materials joining, including medical devices, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), sensors, aerospace and defense industries.  The results from this project will be disseminated through the NSF NSEC Center for High-rate Nanomanufacturing (CHN), the New England Lead-free Electronics Consortium (over 30 local and national companies), the Integrated Electronics Engineering Center (IEEC) in New York, and professional conferences.  Technical seminars, joint workshops, and conferences on nanosolders and nanoelectronics assembly will be organized by the PIs at the two institutions in Massachusetts and New York.  The new findings will also be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses, including the development of new nano-joining lab modules, and in K-12 outreach with the Museum of Science (MoS) in Boston.","Qiyue Yin, Fan Gao, Zhiyong Gu, Eric A.

Although nanotechnology has experienced dramatic development in the area of electronics and devices, some key challenges have to be overcome in order to reach the stage of nanoelectronics manufacturing and commercialization. One major challenge in nanoelectronics and device research is the effective joining and bonding of nano-components (such as nanowires or carbon nanotubes) with low contact resistance to obtain reliable electrical and thermal interconnection. In this project, the PIs have synthesized a variety of promising lead-free nanosolders, in the form of isotropic nanostructures (nanospheres) and anisotropic nanostructures (such as one-dimensional nanorods, high-aspect ratio nanowires, etc), by a combination of surfactant-assisted chemical reduction method and electrodeposition method using nanoporous templates. Fundamental properties underlying their potential applications in nanoscale assembly and nano-joining, including melting points and melting behavior of the nanosolders, nanoscale wetting, inter-metallic formation, and phase transformation have been investigated by utilizing model systems such as pure Sn nanowires and Cu-Sn nanowire diffusion couples. Some significant issues of nanosolders, including surface oxidation and Kirkendall voiding phenomena, have been probed and investigated by using several techniques including SEM, high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), electron diffraction, XRD and DSC. It was observed that the oxidation and voiding phenomena are significant issues at the nanoscale that need to be mitigated in order to form good bonding and joining. Cu-Cu joining has been enabled by a novel UPC (ultrasonic powder consolidation) fabricated nanosolder film, which successfully bonded Cu-Cu sheets, and the solder joint between Cu-Cu sheets showed good mechanical strength. Some of the related results on nanocomposite solders (blending nanosolder particles with commercial micro-sized solder balls into a nanocomposite paste) has led to one patent application and helped the PI to seek additional funding in the area of product scale-up and commercialization, which resulted in I-Corps award and PFI-AIR:TT award, which is currently ongoing. Through this project, one book chapter has been published by Springer, four journal papers have been published in Acta Materialia, Nanoscale, Materials and Design, and Journal of Materials Research, and three conference papers have been published in IEEE Electronic Components and Technology Conference; in addition, two papers have been submitted for publication and one more journal paper is currently being prepared. One postdoc, four graduate students, a total of 14 undergraduate students (including REU student), and one high school student have been involved in this project and collaborated with our academic partner at SUNY-Binghamton, through which one Ph.D. Dissertation, one Master?s thesis and two undergraduate Honor?s theses have been generated. The postdoc and students also interacted with our industrial partners through the New England Lead-free Electronics Consortium, by visiting the industrial partners and giving them research presentations on our recent development of nanosolders and exploring the practical applications of these nanosolder materials. 4 groups of Capstone Design students from the Mechanical Engineering Department (a total of 17 senior students) also participated in the project, under the supervision of the PIs and graduate students, who design the parts and setup for mechanical testing and participated in the mechanical measurements. The postdoc and graduate students have given over twenty conference presentations in TMS Annual Meetings, IEEE ECTC Conferences, MRS Fall Meetings, AIChE Annual Meetings, iMAPS New England Symposiums, IPC APEX EXPO Technical Conferences, International Materials Research (IMR) Congress, and International Conference on Nanojoining and Microjoining (NMJ), and the PI has been invited to give over ten seminars and invited talks in universities, conferences and corporations.

The intellectual merits of the effort are underscored by the market need for 3D spatial products, the readiness of existing R&D to transition to market, and lack of a vehicle to accomplish technology transfer.

Society, students and faculty will benefit broadly from the proposed plan of activities. The project flow follows the model of RIT's NSF funded Science Masters Program in Decision Support Technologies for Environmental Forecasting and Disaster Response which requires students to understand fundamentals of business, markets, and entrepreneurism in participation with the Business School. Dissemination of the results of the work will be in keeping with the regular publication of non-proprietary academic achievements and through the commercialization of image analysis and rendering products. The benefits to society will come through the adoption of these products, aided by the creation of a significant number of skilled workers in the field.","Romanczyk P., J. van Aardt J., K.

Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) developed the C3I research alliance around academic partner Cornell University, and industry partners Lockheed-Martin, Exelis, and Pictometry International, all big players in the domain of remote sensing. We later added a smaller business, Alta Systems, to extend our algorithms to unmanned platforms.  The C3I was designed to translate cutting-edge academic research in 3D photogrammetry and extraction of information from images into tools for rapid, automated production of high fidelity 3D virtual worlds. The C3I was backed by over $675,000 in support from these market-leading firms in the areas of remote sensing systems, information products, and services. Our non-exclusive, royalty-free intellectual property (IP) strategy promoted technology transfer and the addition of new partners. We also included a heavy emphasis on entrepreneurial development by engaging the Venture Creations Incubator within RIT?s Saunders College of Business. Student educational experience was modeled after our NSF-funded Science Masters Program (SMP) in ""Decision Support Technologies For Environmental Forecasting and Disaster Response"", which engaged technical students in a learning experience that included understanding fundamentals of business, markets, and entrepreneurship.

Our project objectives were to (i) leverage 3D algorithm research by RIT and Cornell through a non-exclusive, royalty free intellectual property (IP) agreement, (ii) combine technical expertise at RIT and Cornell with business/marketing know-how from commercial partners, facilitated through the Saunders College of Business at RIT, and (iii) educate the next generation 3D innovators in the form of imaging science, computer science, and business students that are affiliated with C3I. More than 14 graduate students at RIT were also actively engaged in the targeted research and will be uniquely qualified to contribute to the 3D remote sensing business sector.

Pictometry International wanted to investigate the automated extraction of 3D building models from their proprietary oblique airborne imagery &ndash; we were able to accurately and efficiently extract 3D buildings from the company?s image-derived point clouds (x,y,z data). The initial objective of our work with Exelis was to develop a dense 3D point cloud from high frame rate oblique imagery taken by Exelis' WAAS Sensor; we were successful in building a 3D city model for Rochester, NY, using the Exelis data. The one-year effort with Lockheed-Martin, on the other hand, revolved around characterizing 3D planes (facets), i.e., can we classify a facet as being a door, or a window, etc.? Our conclusion was that the typical red-green-blue imagery is not amenable to such accurate classification. Finally, we also investigated the use of 3D light detection and ranging (lidar) data to measure and map urban forest biomass and carbon. This project used the fusion of high-resolution imagery and laser data to accurately map the forest biomass in Rochester, NY.

            From a purely dissemination or academic perspective, we published more than 22 conference abstracts or talks, journal papers, or invited contributions over the course of the project. However, such academics are of little use if they are not applicable to the industry and larger community around us.

In particular, these recent advances point the way to mitigating genetic vulnerability that has been exacerbated by the intensive use of transgenic cultivars in cotton and many other crops. Among the most promising opportunities to enhance the genetic diversity of Upland cotton are exotic accessions with a host of valuable attributes that have been converted to ?breeder-friendly? forms. Our partnership was designed to address both short-term and long-term opportunities for translation of increased knowledge of cotton gene function into commercially viable products, also qualitatively strengthening the cotton innovation ecosystem. Genetic vulnerability is a complex problem that results from a crop?s evolutionary history, trends in breeding and biotechnology practices, and grower decisions, all responding to the inevitable pressures of processor and consumer preferences. Our translational research directly addresses the first dimension of a solution, providing closely-spaced DNA markers to improve the precision at which novel alleles can be introduced into superior cultivars. Thanks to a partnership with the Institute for Genomics, Biocomputing &amp; Biotechnology, Mississippi State University, headed by Professor Daniel Peterson, we accomplished much more sequence generation than proposed.  This additional information added novel elements to the description of the cotton reference genome (Paterson et al 2012), in particular comparing elite cottons to their progenitors and other wild relatives that do not make spinnable fiber to identify candidate mutations that cause striking amino acid changes and are correlated with the evolution of the organ that make cotton a major crop.

 Thanks to the leveraging we gained from partnership in sequencing, in consultation with our research partners we accelerated activity toward generation of nested association mapping (NAM) populations, a next, key, step in identifying which SNPs are closely-linked to or even causal of variations in economically important traits.  More than 40 populations have been generated, of crosses between elite cotton genotypes DES 56 and Acala Maxxa, and representatives of the 7 recognized wild/feral ?races?.  Most of these have reached the F5 generation (considered to be suitable for genetic analysis) and seed increases are now being planned to permit coordinated growouts by cotton breeders across the USA with subsequent integrative analysis.  Ongoing financial and in-kind support toward this important goal continues to be provided from one of our matching sponsors, Cotton Inc.  Direct participation and matching funds from one of the world?s largest cotton improvement companies, Bayer BioScience (with 46% market share in US cotton), matched by funding from the Consortium for Plant Biotechnology Research, provided an ?early adopter? that is now quickly translating results into new commercial products, through their established breeding and commercialization programs. One postdoctoral scientist and two graduate students have been directly engaged in this work, and numerous additional postdocs and students have been peripherally involved and aware of the activities and findings of this work.  This award partially funded summer research experiences for a total of eight Georgia HS teachers under the Georgia Intern-Fellowships for Teachers (GIFT) program, a paid summer internship for science, mathematics and technology teachers (www.ceismc.gatech.edu/gift/), working with HS students as well as with participating faculty and other members of the PI?s lab to develop novel additions to science curriculum founded on plant biology and genomics.

Intellectual Merit: The proposed research is transformative, with the potential to increase internal combustion engine efficiency, resulting in reformulated biofuels that meet or surpass emissions regulations. Integrated theoretical, computational, and experimental studies of neat methyl esters advanced basic knowledge and applied technology in advanced combustion, efficient emissions control, and biofuels formulation. Classical combustion and low-temperature combustion, which minimizes in-cylinder NOx and particulate matter (PM), have been compared by investigating reactivity controlled compression ignition, and a mixed mode coupled to compression ignition direct injection and indirect diesel injection with biofuels. The interdisciplinary team assessed engine control and performance, biofuel formulation, and public health concerns related to emissions.
Broader Impacts: The requested instrument and resulting research contributed to:
a.    Completing the state-of-the-art instrumentation GSU?s Renewable Energy Laboratory and allowing to study biofuels from formulation to emissions.

Heaven of Emory University and his research group will investigate unusual bonding mechanisms in (1) beryllium clusters containing 3 - 30 Be atoms,  and (2) the interactions between beryllium oxide (BeO) and rare gas atoms (helium, neon and argon). The ultimate aim of these studies is to develop a better understanding of the unusual modes of bonding that are not well-characterized in terms of conventional models, and to advance our understanding of bonding when clusters grow from a few atoms in size to large systems that approach bulk metal behavior. The BeO rare gas studies will address intriguing theoretical results that predict unusually strong bonds involving normally inert rare gas elements. A variety of experimental tools will be employed, including photodetachment spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence, resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization, and cavity ring-down spectroscopy.

The results from these studies will help chemists to develop a deeper understanding of bonding that encompasses the traditional models of bonding as well as the unusual interactions that are one of the themes of the present study. The research will provide the graduate and undergraduate students, and post-doctoral associates involved with a rich experience in advanced experimental and theoretical methods.  A collaboration will be established with Spelman College, to expand the research experience to students from a historically Black women's college.","Heaven, MC; Bondybey, VE; Merritt, JM; Kaledin, AL~The unique bonding characteristics of beryllium and the Group IIA metals~CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS~506~2011~1~http://wok-ws.isiknowledge.com/WoS?recid=196321466#000288987600001~10.1016/j.cplett.2011.02.02~0~ ~0~ ~24/09/2020 04:02:47.230000000, B.

Computational models of chemical bonds are used extensively in the design of new materials, synthetic pathways and catalysts.  While these models are often capable of making accurate predictions, there are certain modes of bonding where the models yield unreliable results.  The chemical properties of the element Beryllium provide many examples of bonds that are not adequately described as either ionic or covalent bonds.  For these bonds, the details of how the motions of the electrons are coordinated are critically important.  As computational models for this problem are developed (for application to all elements), it is essential to have accurate experimental data that can be used to assess and benchmark the theoretical tools.  The aim for this program has been to obtain definitive structure and bonding information for prototypical Beryllium compounds.

            The interactions between Be atoms provide an excellent starting point for examining unusual bonding mechanisms.  Although the bulk metal is a hard, high-melting point substance, the bond between an isolated pair of Be atoms is so weak that the Be2 molecule is not stable at room temperature.  Our studies of this simple diatomic molecule have shown that the bond strength increases by more than a factor of 20 when one electron is removed to form the Be2+ ion.  Calculations, validated by comparing with the properties of Be2 and Be2+, show that the bond strength increases rapidly in going from Be2 to Be3, in a markedly non-additive fashion. The hypermetallic compound BeOBe presents another unusual bonding situation.  As both BeO and Be have completed electron shells, basic molecular orbital theory predicts that there will be little in the way of a bonding interaction for the second Be atom.  Our measurements showed that BeOBe is quite strongly bound, with a linear symmetric structure.  For this species, removing an electron had only a minor effect on the bond strength.  Large-scale electronic structure calculations were successful in predicting the properties of BeOBe and explaining the origin of the bonding.

            Be is the lightest member of the group of alkaline earth metals (group IIa).  The known alkaline earth hydroxides (MOH) are linear species with ionic M-O bonds.  In contrast, computational models for BeOH predict a bent structure with appreciable covalent bonding.  We have been able to validate the models by obtaining the first structural information for BeOH and the isotopologue BeOD. Other Be compounds studied in this program included Beryllium Carbide (BeC) and hypermetallic Ben+1On clusters.  Theoretical models were developed that explain the bonding mechanisms that are dominant is these molecules.

            In terms of education and outreach, the broader impact (beyond that of the usual training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows), was ito increase the participation of African American women, which is a notably underrepresented group in the physical sciences.  This was accomplished through a collaboration with  Spelman College in Atlanta.  Spelman, a historically black, liberal arts college for women, has become one of the leading institutions in preparing African American women for careers in science, engineering and mathematics. However, as Spelman does not have a PhD program in chemistry, the research opportunities are limited. To address this need, a program was developed that provides jointly mentored research experiences for Spelman students at Emory.

Significant research and conventional wisdom show that the best way to achieve a high-quality design is to explore multiple variations and iteratively evaluate them.  When novices learn a new skill or system, they must explore and practice the available options.  Similarly, when experts try to understand and improve an existing design, they must explore different approaches to modifying its behavior.  Unfortunately, exploration is risky, error-prone, and cumbersome using today's tools.  For instance, when users decide their current design is not effective, the only mechanisms available for selectively backtracking out of changes are linear undo and version control, which make it difficult to isolate backtracking to specific edits, or else users must manually remove undesired edits, which is slow and fallible.  Further, today's tools do not support comparing two variants of a design or combining elements from multiple variants.  Research is showing that these manual processes inhibit exploration, making users and designs less effective.

To address these problems PIs from four partner institutions have come together to undertake a research program that is both broad and deep, focusing on the creation and management of variations during a system's implementation and evolution.  The goal is to discover new theories, algorithms, visualizations, and tools that support variations in code.  The team will evaluate all of their approaches through lab and field studies, and they will investigate how users can be educated in more effective ways to work with variations.  Based on a choice calculus for representing variations in software, they will develop a theory for formally defining and reasoning about variations.  They will leverage theories of human behavior such as Minimalist Learning, Attention Investment, and Information Foraging, to develop a theory of Variation Foraging.  They will develop an infrastructure including multiple levels of transcripts of users' editing operations that will support a novel form of selective undo and enable users to investigate their existing variants, return to any previous variant, and mix and match elements from multiple variants. They will develop algorithms to enable recording of interactions with variants so they can be explored and reused to explore and test new variants; these recordings will be augmented with automatically created data to help users understand behaviors they have not explicitly explored.  Using this infrastructure the PIs will invent visualizations, search facilities, and interaction techniques that provide effective ways for users to find, understand, explore, reuse and create variants, and be able to ask ""why"" questions to understand the differences among variations of a system.  For novices, an ""Idea Garden"" will help them explore new strategies for identifying which variations can help solve a problem and how to implement them.

Broader Impacts:  This research will enhance infrastructure for research and education by producing an integrated, open source web development environment for use by researchers and the world.  The work will therefore benefit society by empowering the tens of millions of end-user programmers to creatively build content and applications for the web.  The PIs will advance discovery while promoting learning by integrating their research into undergraduate courses on creativity and software engineering, and by supporting summer camps for at least 300 high school students per year.  Project outcomes will be disseminated to researchers through publications and presentations, to computing educators through the above-mentioned camps and the National Girls Collaborative Project, and through public deployment.  The PIs expect high interest because the work will be based on JavaScript, which is today's most popular programming language and for which there is a high demand for better tools.  The research will address underrepresentation via its focus on investigating how to support both male and female end-user programmers, by involving high-school members of underrepresented groups, and by engaging many of the PIs? female students.","Charles Hill, Maren Haag, Alannah Oleson, Chris Mendez, Nicola Marsden, Anita Sarma, Margaret Burnett~Gender-Inclusiveness Personas vs. Stereotyping: Can We Have it Both Ways?~ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'17)~~2017~~~~0~ ~0~ ~17/07/2017 14:32:47.613000000, Martin Erwig and Karl Smeltzer~Variational Pictures~Int.

Or, they plan multiple versions of a program and try to manage them all at once. Unfortunately, there is little support for either of these types of exploration in modern computer programming tools. The result is that software is often less powerful than it could be, or more buggy than we?d like it to be.

 
In this project, we explored ways to improve support for exploration, creating new theories of variation in programs, inventing new tools to support exploration, and evaluating these tools to ensure they better support developers. We invented ways of helping scientists better explore data with code. We discovered ways of ensuring that changes in code do not break software. We devised theories of how programs can express variation, to support more systematic management of alternative designs. We created new editors that track, visualize, and help navigate edit history. In addition to tools, we also devised several new ways for computer programmers to plan for change, including new ways of teaching and supporting problem solving, new methods for ensuring the inclusive design of software, and new techniques for learning to code. These discoveries are impacting many areas of research, including programming languages, software engineering, the science of how people interact with computers, and the science of how people learn to code.

 
However, the impact is more than just on research. Many of the inventions from this research have been released as free, publicly available research prototypes. Some of those prototypes are in the process of being incorporated into commercial products. Other projects have begun to reshape how computer programmers are educated in higher education. The project also directly trained more than two dozen doctoral students and more than three dozen undergraduates on research. Many of these doctoral students are now faculty, and many of the undergraduates are now pursuing PhDs, or have secured jobs in industry as software engineers, data scientists, and designers. The project also offered six summer coding bootcamps to high school students, reaching hundreds of youth, including many girls, youth from underrepresented groups, and youth from low-income regions of the United States.

 
The ideas from this research will continue to impact products, services, education, and our workforce for years to come, helping to improve the reliability, inclusiveness, and value of software over the coming decades.

Consequently, software developers waste a considerable portion of their time trying to find and get to information in that code. To address this problem, this research project will investigate a scientific theory to describe how developers go about seeking this information. The project will then use the expanded theory to identify ways of helping developers to more efficiently find information, and in the process, increase their productivity. This contribution will in turn be put to practical use by providing to builders of today?s software tools new practical ways to apply this scientific theory to their tools, so as to reduce the effort required in today?s software development projects.

In particular, this project will (1) expand Information Foraging Theory to describe how learning affects developers? navigation through code and related artifacts, (2) generate theory-grounded design patterns explaining how to design tools that aid developers' information foraging, (3) develop a design method enabling tool builders to apply these patterns, and (4) evaluate the validity and effectiveness of (1)-(3). Broader impacts will include (a) helping with teaching and learning for software tool builders, professional software developers, graduate students, undergraduates and high schoolers, (b) broadening participation of students from underrepresented groups, (c) producing publicly available infrastructure consisting of design patterns and training materials, (d) disseminating results via publications, software, and workshops, and (e) providing a scientific foundation for future efforts aimed at training developers and designing tools for their use.","Austin Z.

Information Foraging during Debugging~IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution~~2016~~~~0~ ~0~ ~19/08/2016 12:07:05.233000000",,"In recent years, software engineering research has emerged investigating the cost, needs, and support of software navigation during maintenance, with interesting empirical results and a variety of tools resulting. Many of these tools have been demonstrated to be useful, but it is difficult to extract generalizable principles from them, because they lack a connective theoretical basis. Scientific theory provides the principles that enable (software) engineering to move beyond the levels of an individual engineer?s intuitions and experiences. Thus, in the context of engineering of software engineering tools, this project has established theory-grounded foundations that will allow even those tool builders who lack intuition or experience determining human needs to create tools that are genuinely effective for their intended audience.

Proceeding in three stages, this work has harnessed a theory called Information Foraging Theory (IFT) to bring such scientific principles to the researchers and tool builders who create software tools. First, we have expanded IFT?s scientific foundationto include how learning affects developers? navigation through code and related artifacts, resulting in a computational modelthat can accurately describe and predict where programmers may forage for information during software development. Second, drawing upon a literature survey as well as contributions from members of the software engineering community, we established a catalog of over 30 design patterns elucidating how IFT can be used to guide the design of tools that aid ininformation foraging during software development. Third, and finally, we established and validated a design method (with supporting code library) for helping tool designers as they apply these IFT-grounded design patterns.

Overall, the work has led to the publication of 14 peer reviewed publications and theses, the training of 24 students in research (at the graduate, undergraduate, and high-school levels), and the dissemination of our results to over 100 people at companies that design programming tools for software developers. We anticipate that these results will benefit society by showing how tool builders can use theory to produce effective tools that genuinely support developers? work on information-intensive software engineering tasks. The contributions of this work therefore stand to transform the way tool builders create these tools for developers.
